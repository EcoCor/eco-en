     CHAPTER I.

    <p>
     THE BIRTH OF AN IDEA.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sunk far back in the huge leather cushions of his morris chair, old
    </p>
    <p>
     Isaac Flint was thinking, thinking hard. Between narrowed lids, his
    </p>
    <p>
     hard, gray eyes were blinking at the morning sunlight that poured into
    </p>
    <p>
     his private office, high up in the great building he had reared on Wall
    </p>
    <p>
     Street. From his thin lips now and then issued a coil of smoke from the
    </p>
    <p>
     costly cigar he was consuming. His bony legs were crossed, and one foot
    </p>
    <p>
     twitched impatiently. Now and again he tugged at his white mustache. A
    </p>
    <p>
     frown creased his hard brow; and, as he pondered, something of the
    </p>
    <p>
     glitter of a snake seemed reflected in his pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not enough," he muttered, harshly. "It's not enough--there must be
    </p>
    <p>
     more, more, more! Some way must be found. Must be, and shall be!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The sunlight of early spring, glad and warm over Manhattan, brought no
    </p>
    <p>
     message of cheer to the Billionaire. It bore no news of peace and joy to
    </p>
    <p>
     him. Its very brightness, as it flooded the metropolis and mellowed his
    </p>
    <p>
     luxurious inner office, seemed to offend the master of the world. And
    </p>
    <p>
     presently he arose, walked to the window and made as though to lower
    </p>
    <p>
     the shade. But for a moment he delayed this action. Standing there at
    </p>
    <p>
     the window, he peered out. Far below him, the restless, swarming life of
    </p>
    <p>
     the huge city crept and grovelled. Insects that were men and women
    </p>
    <p>
     crowded the clefts that were streets. Long lines of cars, toy-like,
    </p>
    <p>
     crept along the "L" structures. As far as the eye could reach, tufted
    </p>
    <p>
     plumes of smoke and steam wafted away on the April breeze. The East
    </p>
    <p>
     River glistened in the sunlight, its bosom vexed by myriad craft, by
    </p>
    <p>
     ocean liners, by tugs and barges, by grim warships, by sailing-vessels,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose canvas gleamed, by snow-white fruitboats from the tropics, by
    </p>
    <p>
     hulls from every port. Over the bridges, long slow lines of traffic
    </p>
    <p>
     crawled. And, far beyond to the dim horizon, stretched out the hives of
    </p>
    <p>
     men, till the blue depths of distance swallowed all in haze.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as Flint gazed on this marvel, all created and maintained by human
    </p>
    <p>
     toil, by sweat and skill and tireless patience of the workers, a hard
    </p>
    <p>
     smile curved his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All mine, more or less," said he to himself, puffing deep on his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All yielding tribute to me, even as the mines and mills and factories I
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot see yield tribute! Even as the oil-wells, the pipe-lines, the
    </p>
    <p>
     railroads and the subways yield--even as the whole world yields it. All
    </p>
    <p>
     this labor, all this busy strife, I have a hand in. The millions eat and
    </p>
    <p>
     drink and buy and sell; and I take toll of it--yet it is not enough. I
    </p>
    <p>
     hold them in my hand, yet the hand cannot close, completely. And until
    </p>
    <p>
     it does, it is not enough! No, not enough for me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He pondered a moment, standing there musing at the window, surveying
    </p>
    <p>
     "all the wonders of the earth" that in its fulness, in that year of
    </p>
    <p>
     grace, 1921, bore tribute to him who toiled not, neither spun; and
    </p>
    <p>
     though he smiled, the smile was bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not enough, yet," he reflected. "And how--how shall I close my grip?
    </p>
    <p>
     How shall I master all this, absolutely and completely, till it be mine
    </p>
    <p>
     in truth? Through light? The mob can do with less, if I squeeze too
    </p>
    <p>
     hard! Through food? They can economize! Transportation? No, the traffic
    </p>
    <p>
     will bear only a certain load! How, then? What is it they all must have,
    </p>
    <p>
     or die, that I can control? What universal need, vital to rich and poor
    </p>
    <p>
     alike? To great and small? What absolute necessity which shall make my
    </p>
    <p>
     rivals in the Game as much my vassals as the meanest slave in my steel
    </p>
    <p>
     mills? What can it be? For power I must have! Like Caesar, who preferred
    </p>
    <p>
     to be first in the smallest village, rather than be second at Rome, I
    </p>
    <p>
     can and will have no competitor. I must rule _all_, or the game is
    </p>
    <p>
     worthless! But how?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost as in answer to his mental question, a sudden gust of air swayed
    </p>
    <p>
     the curtain and brushed it against his face. And, on the moment,
    </p>
    <p>
     inspiration struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?" he exclaimed suddenly, his brows wrinkling, a strange and eager
    </p>
    <p>
     light burning in his hard eyes. "Eh, what? Can it--could it be possible?
    </p>
    <p>
     My God! If so--if it might be--the world would be my toy, to play with
    </p>
    <p>
     as I like!
    </p>
    <p>
     "If _that_ could happen, kings and emperors would have to cringe and
    </p>
    <p>
     crawl to me, like my hordes of serfs all over this broad land. Statesmen
    </p>
    <p>
     and diplomats, president and judges, lawmakers and captains of industry,
    </p>
    <p>
     all would fall into bondage; and for the first time in history one man
    </p>
    <p>
     would rule the earth, completely and absolutely--_and that man would be
    </p>
    <p>
     Isaac Flint_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Staggered by the very immensity of the bold thought, so vast that for a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment he could not realize it in its entirety, the Billionaire fell to
    </p>
    <p>
     pacing the floor of his office.
    </p>
    <p>
     His cigar now hung dead and unnoticed between his thinly cruel lips. His
    </p>
    <p>
     hands were gripped behind his bent back, as he paced the priceless
    </p>
    <p>
     Shiraz rug, itself having cost the wage of a hundred workmen for a
    </p>
    <p>
     year's hard, grinding toil. And as he trod, up and down, up and down the
    </p>
    <p>
     rich apartments, a slow, grim smile curved his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What editor could withstand me, then?" he was thinking. "What clergyman
    </p>
    <p>
     could raise his voice against my rule? Ah! Their 'high principles' they
    </p>
    <p>
     prate of so eloquently, their crack-brained economics, their rebellions
    </p>
    <p>
     and their strikes--the dogs!--would soon bow down before _that_ power!
    </p>
    <p>
     Men have starved for stiff-necked opposition's sake, and still may do
    </p>
    <p>
     so--but with my hand at the throat of the world, with the world's very
    </p>
    <p>
     life-breath in my grip, what then? Submission, or--ha! well, we shall
    </p>
    <p>
     see, we shall see!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A subtle change came over his face, which had been growing paler for
    </p>
    <p>
     some minutes. Impatiently he flung away his cigar, and, turning to his
    </p>
    <p>
     desk, opened a drawer, took out a little vial and uncorked it. He shook
    </p>
    <p>
     out two small white tablets, on the big sheet of plate-glass that
    </p>
    <p>
     covered the desk, swallowed them eagerly, and replaced the vial in the
    </p>
    <p>
     desk again. For be it known that, master of the world though Flint was,
    </p>
    <p>
     he too had a master--morphine. Long years he had bowed beneath its whip,
    </p>
    <p>
     the veriest slave of the insidious drug. No three hours could pass,
    </p>
    <p>
     without that dosage. His immense native will power still managed to
    </p>
    <p>
     control the dose and not increase it; but years ago he had abandoned
    </p>
    <p>
     hope of ever diminishing or ceasing it. And now he thought no more of it
    </p>
    <p>
     than of--well, of breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Breathing! As he stood up again and drew a deep breath, under the
    </p>
    <p>
     reviving influence of the drug, his inspiration once more recurred to
    </p>
    <p>
     him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Breath!" said he. "Breath is life. Without food and drink and shelter,
    </p>
    <p>
     men can live a while. Even without water, for some days. But without
    </p>
    <p>
     _air_--they die inevitably and at once. And if I make the air my own,
    </p>
    <p>
     then I am master of all life!"
    </p>
    <p>
     And suddenly he burst into a harsh, jangling laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Air!" he cried exultantly, "An Air Trust! By God in Heaven, it can be!
    </p>
    <p>
     It shall be!--it must!"
    </p>
    <p>
     His mind, somewhat sluggish before he had taken the morphine, now was
    </p>
    <p>
     working clearly and accurately again, with that fateful and undeviating
    </p>
    <p>
     precision which had made him master of billions of dollars and uncounted
    </p>
    <p>
     millions of human lives; which had woven his network of possession all
    </p>
    <p>
     over the United States, Europe and Asia and even Africa; which had
    </p>
    <p>
     drawn, as into a spider's web, the world's railroads and steamship
    </p>
    <p>
     lines, its coal and copper and steel, its oil and grain and beef, its
    </p>
    <p>
     every need--save air!
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, keen on the track of this last great inspiration, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire strode to his revolving book-case, whirled it round and from
    </p>
    <p>
     its shelves jerked a thick volume, a smaller book and some pamphlets.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let's have some facts!" said he, flinging them upon his desk, and
    </p>
    <p>
     seating himself before it in a costly chair of teak. "Once I get an
    </p>
    <p>
     outline of the facts and what I want to do, then my subordinates can
    </p>
    <p>
     carry out my plans. Before all, I must have facts!"
    </p>
    <p>
     For half an hour he thumbed his references, noting all the salient
    </p>
    <p>
     points mentally, without taking a single note; for, so long as the drug
    </p>
    <p>
     still acted, his brain was an instrument of unsurpassed keenness and
    </p>
    <p>
     accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sinister figure he made, as he sat there poring intently over the
    </p>
    <p>
     technical books before him, contrasting strangely with the beauty and
    </p>
    <p>
     the luxury of the office. On the mantel, over the fireplace of Carrara
    </p>
    <p>
     marble, ticked a Louis XIV clock, the price of which might have saved
    </p>
    <p>
     the lives of a thousand workingmen's children during the last summer's
    </p>
    <p>
     torment. Gold-woven tapestries from Rouen covered the walls, whereon
    </p>
    <p>
     hung etchings and rare prints. Old Flint's office, indeed, had more the
    </p>
    <p>
     air of an art gallery than a place where grim plots and deals
    </p>
    <p>
     innumerable had been put through, lawmakers corrupted past counting, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the destinies of nations bent beneath his corded, lean and nervous hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, as the Billionaire sat there thinking, smiling a smile that
    </p>
    <p>
     boded no good to the world, the soft spring air that had inspired his
    </p>
    <p>
     great plan still swayed the silken curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of a sudden, he slammed the big book shut, that he was studying, and
    </p>
    <p>
     rose to his feet with a hard laugh--the laugh that had presaged more
    </p>
    <p>
     than one calamity to mankind. Beneath the sweep of his mustache one
    </p>
    <p>
     caught the glint of a gold tooth, sharp and unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
     A moment he stood there, keen, eager, dominant, his hands gripping the
    </p>
    <p>
     edge of the desk till the big knuckles whitened. He seemed the
    </p>
    <p>
     embodiment of harsh and unrelenting Power--power over men and things,
    </p>
    <p>
     over their laws and institutions; power which, like Alexander's, sought
    </p>
    <p>
     only new worlds to conquer; power which found all metes and bounds too
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Power!" he whispered, as though to voice the inner inclining of the
    </p>
    <p>
     picture. "Life, air, breath--the very breath of the world in my
    </p>
    <p>
     hands--power absolutely, at last!"

     CHAPTER II.

    <p>
     THE PARTNERS.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as was his habit, translating ideas into immediate action, he
    </p>
    <p>
     strode to a door at the far end of the office, flung it open and said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "See here a minute, Wally!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Busy!" came an answering voice, from behind a huge roll-top desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course! But drop it, drop it. I've got news for you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Urgent?" asked the voice, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very. Come in here, a minute. I've got to unload!"
    </p>
    <p>
     From behind the big desk rose the figure of a man about five and forty,
    </p>
    <p>
     sandy-haired, long-faced and sallow, with a pair of the coldest,
    </p>
    <p>
     fishiest eyes--eyes set too close together--that ever looked out of a
    </p>
    <p>
     flat and ugly face. A man precisely dressed, something of a fop, with
    </p>
    <p>
     just a note of the "sport" in his get-up; a man to fear, a man cool,
    </p>
    <p>
     wary and dangerous--Maxim Waldron, in fact, the Billionaire's right-hand
    </p>
    <p>
     man and confidant. Waldron, for some time affianced to his eldest
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter. Waldron the arch-corruptionist; Waldron, who never yet had
    </p>
    <p>
     been "caught with the goods," but who had financed scores of industrial
    </p>
    <p>
     and political campaigns, with Flint's money and his own; Waldron, the
    </p>
    <p>
     smooth, the suave, the perilous.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What now?" asked he, fixing his pale blue eyes on the Billionaire's
    </p>
    <p>
     face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come in here, and I'll tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right!" And Waldron, brushing an invisible speck of dust from the
    </p>
    <p>
     sleeve of his checked coat, strolled rather casually into the
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire's office.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well?" asked Waldron, with something of a drawl. "What's the
    </p>
    <p>
     excitement?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "See here," began the great financier, stimulated by the drug. "We've
    </p>
    <p>
     been wasting our time, all these years, with our petty monopolies of
    </p>
    <p>
     beef and coal and transportation and all such trifles!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "So?" And Waldron drew from his pocket a gold cigar-case, monogrammed
    </p>
    <p>
     with diamonds. "Trifles, eh?" He carefully chose a perfecto. "Perhaps;
    </p>
    <p>
     but we've managed to rub along, eh? Well, if these are trifles, what's
    </p>
    <p>
     on?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Air!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Air?" Waldron's match poised a moment, as with a slight widening of the
    </p>
    <p>
     pale blue eyes he surveyed his partner. "Why--er--what do you mean,
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Air Trust!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eh?" And Waldron lighted his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A monopoly of breathing privileges!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ha! Ha!" Waldron's laugh was as mirthful as a grave-yard raven's croak.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing to it, old man. Forget it, and stick to--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course! I might have expected as much from you!" retorted the
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire tartly. "You've got neither imagination nor--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nor any fancy for wild-goose chases," said Waldron, easily, as he sat
    </p>
    <p>
     down in the big leather chair. "Air? Hot air, Flint! No, no, it won't
    </p>
    <p>
     do! Nothing to it nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment the Billionaire regarded him with a look of intense
    </p>
    <p>
     irritation. His thin lips moved, as though to emit some caustic answer;
    </p>
    <p>
     but he managed to keep silence. The two men looked at each other, a long
    </p>
    <p>
     minute; then Flint began again:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Listen, now, and keep still! The idea came to me not an hour ago, this
    </p>
    <p>
     morning, looking over the city, here. We've got a finger on everything
    </p>
    <p>
     but the atmosphere, the most important thing of all. If we could control
    </p>
    <p>
     _that_--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course, I understand," interrupted the other, blowing a ring of
    </p>
    <p>
     smoke. "Unlimited power and so on. Looks very nice, and all. Only, it
    </p>
    <p>
     can't be done. Air's too big, too fluid, too universal. Human powers
    </p>
    <p>
     can't control it, any more than the ocean. Talk about monopolizing the
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlantic, if you will, Flint. But for heaven's sake, drop--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't be done, eh?" exclaimed Flint, warmly, sitting down on the
    </p>
    <p>
     desk-top and levelling a big-jointed forefinger at his partner. "That's
    </p>
    <p>
     what every new idea has had to meet. It's no argument! People scoffed at
    </p>
    <p>
     the idea of gas lighting when it was new. Called it 'burning smoke,' and
    </p>
    <p>
     made merry over it. That was as recently as 1832. But ten years later,
    </p>
    <p>
     gas-illumination was in full sway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Electric lighting met the same objection. And remember the objection to
    </p>
    <p>
     the telephone? When Congress, in 1843, granted Morse an appropriation of
    </p>
    <p>
     $30,000 to run the first telegraph line from Baltimore to Washington,
    </p>
    <p>
     one would-be humorist in that supremely intelligent body tried to
    </p>
    <p>
     introduce an amendment that part of the sum should be spent in surveying
    </p>
    <p>
     a railroad to the moon! And--"
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: "Can't be done, Eh?" said Flint.]
    </p>
    <p>
     "Granted," put in Waldron, "that my objection is futile, just what's
    </p>
    <p>
     your idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "This!" And Flint stabbed at him with his forefinger, while the other
    </p>
    <p>
     financier regarded him with a fishily amused eye. "Every human being in
    </p>
    <p>
     this world--and there are 1,900,000,000 of them now!--is breathing, on
    </p>
    <p>
     the average, 16 cubic feet of air every hour, or about 400 a day. The
    </p>
    <p>
     total amount of oxygen actually absorbed in the 24 hours by each person,
    </p>
    <p>
     is about 17 cubic feet, or _over 30 billions of cubic feet of oxygen_,
    </p>
    <p>
     each day, in the entire world. Get that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well?" drawled the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't you see?" snapped Flint, irritably. "Imagine that we extract
    </p>
    <p>
     oxygen from the air. Then--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You might as well try to dip up the ocean with a spoon," said Waldron,
    </p>
    <p>
     "as try to vitiate the atmosphere of the whole world, by any means
    </p>
    <p>
     whatsoever! But even if you could, what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look here!" exclaimed the Billionaire. "It only needs a reduction of 10
    </p>
    <p>
     per cent. in the atmospheric oxygen to make the air so bad that nobody
    </p>
    <p>
     can breathe it without discomfort and pain. Take out any more and people
    </p>
    <p>
     will die! We don't have to monopolize _all_ the oxygen, but only a very
    </p>
    <p>
     small fraction, and the world will come gasping to us, like so many fish
    </p>
    <p>
     out of water, falling over each other to buy!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Possibly. But the details?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I haven't worked them out yet, naturally. I needn't. Herzog will take
    </p>
    <p>
     care of those. He and his staff. That's what they're for. Shall we put
    </p>
    <p>
     it up to him? What? My God, man! Think of the millions in it--the
    </p>
    <p>
     billions! The power! The--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course, of course!" interposed Waldron, calmly, eyeing his smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't get excited, Flint. Rome wasn't built in a day. There may be
    </p>
    <p>
     something in this; possibly there may be the germ of an idea. I don't
    </p>
    <p>
     say it's impossible. It looks visionary to me; but then, as you well
    </p>
    <p>
     say, so has every new idea always looked. Let me think, now; let me
    </p>
    <p>
     think."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go ahead and think!" growled the Billionaire. "Think and be hanged to
    </p>
    <p>
     you! _I'm_ going to act!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron vouchsafed no reply, but merely eyed his partner with cold
    </p>
    <p>
     interest, as though he were some biological specimen under a lens, and
    </p>
    <p>
     smoked the while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, however, turned to his telephone and pulled it toward him, over
    </p>
    <p>
     the big sheet of plate glass. Impatiently he took off the receiver and
    </p>
    <p>
     held it up to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello, hello! 2438 John!" he exclaimed, in answer to the query of
    </p>
    <p>
     "Number, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence, a moment, while Waldron slowly drew at his cigar and while the
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire tugged with impatience at his gray mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello! That you, Herzog?"
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right. I want to see you at once. Immediately, understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well. And say, Herzog!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bring whatever literature you have on liquid air, nitrogen extraction
    </p>
    <p>
     from the atmosphere, and so on. Understand? And come at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's all! Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Smiling dourly, with satisfaction, he hung up and shoved the telephone
    </p>
    <p>
     away again, then turned to his still reflecting partner, who had now
    </p>
    <p>
     hoisted his patent leather boots to the window sill and seemed absorbed
    </p>
    <p>
     in regarding their gloss through a blue veil of nicotine.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Herzog," announced the Billionaire, "will be here in ten minutes, and
    </p>
    <p>
     we'll get down to business."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So?" languidly commented the immaculate Waldron. "Well, much as I'd
    </p>
    <p>
     like to flatter your astuteness, Flint, I'm bound to say you're barking
    </p>
    <p>
     up a false trail, this time! Beef, yes. Steel, yes. Railroads,
    </p>
    <p>
     steamships, coal, iron, wheat, yes. All tangible, all concrete, all
    </p>
    <p>
     susceptible of being weighed, measured, put in figures, fenced and
    </p>
    <p>
     bounded, legislated about and so on and so forth. But _air_--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He snapped his manicured fingers, to show his well-considered contempt
    </p>
    <p>
     for the Billionaire's scheme, and, throwing away his smoked-out cigar,
    </p>
    <p>
     chose a fresh one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint made no reply, but with an angry grunt flung a look of scorn at
    </p>
    <p>
     the calm and placid one. Then, furtively opening his desk drawer, he
    </p>
    <p>
     once more sought the little vial and took two more pellets--an action
    </p>
    <p>
     which Waldron, without moving his head, complacently observed in a
    </p>
    <p>
     heavily-bevelled mirror that hung between the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Air," murmured Waldron, suavely. "Hot air, Flint?"
    </p>
    <p>
     No answer, save another grunt and the slamming of the desk-drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And thus, in silence, the two men, masters of the world, awaited the
    </p>
    <p>
     coming of the practical scientist, the proletarian, on whom they both,
    </p>
    <p>
     at last analysis, had to rely for most of their results.

     CHAPTER III.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE BAITING OF HERZOG.
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog was not long in arriving. To be summoned in haste by Isaac Flint,
    </p>
    <p>
     and to delay, was unthinkable. For eighteen years the chemist had
    </p>
    <p>
     lickspittled to the Billionaire. Keen though his mind was, his character
    </p>
    <p>
     and stamina were those of a jellyfish; and when the Master took snuff,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the saying is, Herzog never failed to sneeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     He therefore appeared, now, in some ten minutes--a fat, rubicund,
    </p>
    <p>
     spectacled man, with a cast in his left eye and two fingers missing, to
    </p>
    <p>
     remind him of early days in experimental work on explosives. Under his
    </p>
    <p>
     arm he carried several tomes and pamphlets; and so, bowing first to one
    </p>
    <p>
     financier, then to the other, he stood there on the threshold, awaiting
    </p>
    <p>
     his masters' pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come in, Herzog," directed Flint. "Got some material there on liquid
    </p>
    <p>
     air, and nitrogen, and so on?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. Just what is it you want, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sit down, and I'll tell you,"--for the chemist, hat in hand, ventured
    </p>
    <p>
     not to seat himself unbidden in presence of these plutocrats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog, murmuring thanks for Flint's gracious permission, deposited his
    </p>
    <p>
     derby on top of the revolving book-case, sat down tentatively on the edge
    </p>
    <p>
     of a chair and clutched his books as though they had been so many
    </p>
    <p>
     shields against the redoubted power of his masters.
    </p>
    <p>
     "See here, Herzog," Flint fired at him, without any preliminaries or
    </p>
    <p>
     beating around the bush, "what do you know about the practical side of
    </p>
    <p>
     extracting nitrogen from atmospheric air? Or extracting oxygen, in
    </p>
    <p>
     liquid form? Can it be done--that is, on a commercial basis?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, no, sir--yes, that is--perhaps. I mean--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the devil _do_ you mean?" snapped Flint, while Waldron smiled
    </p>
    <p>
     maliciously as he smoked. "Yes, or no? I don't pay you to muddle things.
    </p>
    <p>
     I pay you to _know_, and to tell me! Get that? Now, how about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, sir--hm!--the fact is," and the unfortunate chemist blinked
    </p>
    <p>
     through his glasses with extreme uneasiness, "the fact of the matter is
    </p>
    <p>
     that the processes involved haven't been really perfected, as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beginnings have been made, but no large-scale work has been done, so
    </p>
    <p>
     far. Still, the principle--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is sound?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. I imagine--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cut that! You aren't paid for imagining!" interrupted the Billionaire,
    </p>
    <p>
     stabbing at him with that characteristic gesture. "Just what do you know
    </p>
    <p>
     about it? No technicalities, mind! Essentials, that's all, and in a few
    </p>
    <p>
     words!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, sir," answered Herzog, plucking up a little courage under this
    </p>
    <p>
     pointed goading, "so far as the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen goes,
    </p>
    <p>
     more progress has been made in England and Scandinavia, than here.
    </p>
    <p>
     They're working on it, over there, to obtain cheap and plentiful
    </p>
    <p>
     fertilizer from the air. Nitrogen _can_ be obtained from the air, even
    </p>
    <p>
     now, and made into fertilizers even cheaper than the Chili saltpeter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oxygen is liberated as a by-product, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, it is, eh? And could it be saved? In liquid form for instance?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think so, sir. The Siemens &amp; Halske interests, in Germany, are doing
    </p>
    <p>
     it already, on a limited scale. In Norway and Austria, nitrogen has been
    </p>
    <p>
     manufactured from air, for some years."
    </p>
    <p>
     "On a paying, commercial basis?" demanded Flint, while Waldron, now a
    </p>
    <p>
     trifle less scornful, seemed to listen with more interest as his eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     rested on the rotund form of the scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir, quite so," answered Herzog. "It's commercially feasible,
    </p>
    <p>
     though not a very profitable business at best. The gas is utilized in
    </p>
    <p>
     chemical combination with a substantial base, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No matter about that, just yet," interrupted Flint. "We can have
    </p>
    <p>
     details later. Do you know of any such business as yet, in the United
    </p>
    <p>
     States?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, sir, there's a plant building at Great Falls, South Carolina, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the purpose. It is to run by waterpower and will develop 5000 H.P."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hear that, Waldron?" demanded the Billionaire. "It's already beginning
    </p>
    <p>
     even here! But not one of these plants is working for what I see as the
    </p>
    <p>
     prime possibility. No imagination, no grasp on the subject! No wonder
    </p>
    <p>
     most inventors and scientists die poor! They incubate ideas and then
    </p>
    <p>
     lack the warmth to hatch them into general application. It takes men
    </p>
    <p>
     like us, Wally--practical men--to turn the trick!" He spoke a bit
    </p>
    <p>
     rapidly, almost feverishly, under the influence of the subtle drug. "Now
    </p>
    <p>
     if _we_ take hold of this game, why, we can shake the world as it has
    </p>
    <p>
     never yet been shaken! Eh, Waldron? What do you think now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron only grunted, non-committally. Flint with a hard glance at his
    </p>
    <p>
     unresponsive partner, once more turned to Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
     "See here, now," directed he. "What's the best process now in use?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "For what, sir?" ventured the timid chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
     "For the simultaneous production of nitrogen and oxygen, from the
    </p>
    <p>
     atmosphere!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, sir," he answered, deprecatingly, as though taking a great
    </p>
    <p>
     liberty even in informing his master on a point the master had expressly
    </p>
    <p>
     asked about, "there are three processes. But all operate only on a small
    </p>
    <p>
     scale."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who ever told you I wanted to work on a large scale?" demanded Flint,
    </p>
    <p>
     savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I--er--inferred--beg pardon, sir--I--" And Herzog quite lost himself
    </p>
    <p>
     and floundered hopelessly, while his mismated eyes wandered about the
    </p>
    <p>
     room as though seeking the assurance he so sadly lacked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Confine yourself to answering what I ask you," directed Flint, crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're not paid to infer. You're paid to answer questions on chemistry,
    </p>
    <p>
     and to get results. Remember _that_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir," meekly answered the chemist, while Waldron smiled with
    </p>
    <p>
     cynical amusement. He enjoyed nothing so delightedly as any grilling of
    </p>
    <p>
     an employee, whether miner, railroad man, clerk, ship's captain or
    </p>
    <p>
     what-not. This baiting, by Flint, was a rare treat to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go on," commanded the Billionaire, in a badgering tone. "What are the
    </p>
    <p>
     processes?" He eyed Herzog as though the man had been an ox, a dog or
    </p>
    <p>
     even some inanimate object, coldly and with narrow-lidded condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
     To him, in truth, men were no more than Shelley's "plow or sword or
    </p>
    <p>
     spade" for his own purpose--things to serve him and to be ruled--or
    </p>
    <p>
     broken--as best served his ends. "Go on! Tell me what you know; and no
    </p>
    <p>
     more!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir," ventured Herzog. "There are three processes to extract
    </p>
    <p>
     nitrogen and oxygen from air. One is by means of what the German
    </p>
    <p>
     scientists call _Kalkstickstoff_, between calcium carbide and nitrogen,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the reaction-symbols are--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No matter," Flint waived him, promptly. "I don't care for formulas or
    </p>
    <p>
     details. What I want is results and general principles. Any other way to
    </p>
    <p>
     extract these substances, in commercial quantities, from the air we
    </p>
    <p>
     breathe?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Two others. But one of these operates at a prohibitive cost. The
    </p>
    <p>
     other--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, yes. What is it?" Flint slid off the edge of the table and walked
    </p>
    <p>
     over to Herzog; stood there in front of him, and bored down at him with
    </p>
    <p>
     eager eyes, the pupils contracted by morphine, but very bright. "What's
    </p>
    <p>
     the best way?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "With the electric arc, sir," answered the chemist, mopping his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     This grilling method reminded him of what he had heard of "Third Degree"
    </p>
    <p>
     torments. "That's the best method, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now in use, anywhere?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "In Notodden, Norway. They have firebrick furnaces, you understand, sir,
    </p>
    <p>
     with an alternating current of 5000 volts between water-cooled copper
    </p>
    <p>
     electrodes. The resulting arc is spread by powerful electro-magnets,
    </p>
    <p>
     so." And he illustrated with his eight acid-stained fingers. "Spread
    </p>
    <p>
     out like a disk or sphere of flame, of electric fire, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, and what then?" demanded Flint, while his partner, forgetting now
    </p>
    <p>
     to smile, sat there by the window scrutinizing him. One saw, now, the
    </p>
    <p>
     terribly keen and prehensile intellect at work under the mask of assumed
    </p>
    <p>
     foppishness and jesting indifference--the quality, for the most part
    </p>
    <p>
     masked, which had earned Waldron the nickname of "Tiger" in Wall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What then?" repeated Flint, once more levelling that potent forefinger
    </p>
    <p>
     at the sweating Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, sir, that gives a large reactive surface, through which the air
    </p>
    <p>
     is driven by powerful rotary fans. At the high temperature of the
    </p>
    <p>
     electric arc in air, the molecules of nitrogen and oxygen dissociate
    </p>
    <p>
     into their atoms. The air comes out of the arc, charged with about one
    </p>
    <p>
     per cent. of nitric oxide, and after that--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jump the details, idiot! Can't you move faster than a paralytic snail?
    </p>
    <p>
     What's the final result?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The result is, sir," answered Herzog, meek and cowed under this
    </p>
    <p>
     harrying, "that calcium nitrate is produced, a very excellent
    </p>
    <p>
     fertilizer. It's a form of nitrogen, you see, directly obtained from
    </p>
    <p>
     air."
    </p>
    <p>
     "At what cost?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "One ton of fixed nitrogen in that form costs about $150 or $160."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Indeed?" commented Flint. "The same amount, combined in Chile
    </p>
    <p>
     saltpeter, comes to--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "A little over $300, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hear that, Wally?" exclaimed the Billionaire, turning to his now
    </p>
    <p>
     interested associate. "Even if this idea never goes a step farther,
    </p>
    <p>
     there's a gold mine in just the production of fertilizer from air! But,
    </p>
    <p>
     after all, that will only be a by-product. It's the oxygen we're after,
    </p>
    <p>
     and must have!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He faced Herzog again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is any oxygen liberated, during the process?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "At one stage, yes, sir. But in the present process, it is absorbed,
    </p>
    <p>
     also."
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint's eyebrows contracted nervously. For a moment he stood thinking,
    </p>
    <p>
     while Herzog eyed him with trepidation, and Waldron, almost forgetting
    </p>
    <p>
     to smoke, waited developments with interest. The Billionaire, however,
    </p>
    <p>
     wasted but scant time in consideration. It was not money now, he lusted
    </p>
    <p>
     for, but power. Money was, to him, no longer any great desideratum. At
    </p>
    <p>
     most, it could now mean no more to him than a figure on a check-book or
    </p>
    <p>
     a page of statistics in his private memoranda. But power, unlimited,
    </p>
    <p>
     indisputable power over the whole earth and the fulness thereof, power
    </p>
    <p>
     which none might dispute, power before which all humanity must bow--God!
    </p>
    <p>
     the lust of it now gripped and shook his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Paling a little, but with eyes ablaze, he faced the anxious scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Herzog! See here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got a job for you, understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "A big job, and one on which your entire future depends. Put it through,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I'll do well by you. Fail, and by the Eternal, I'll break you! I
    </p>
    <p>
     can, and will, mark that! Do you get me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I--yes, sir--that is, I'll do my best, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Listen! You go to work at once, immediately, understand? Work out for
    </p>
    <p>
     me some process, some practicable method by which the nitrogen and
    </p>
    <p>
     oxygen can both be collected in large quantities from the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything in my laboratories at Oakwood Heights is at your disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Money's no object. Nothing counts, now, but _results_!
    </p>
    <p>
     "I want the process all mapped out and ready for me, in its essential
    </p>
    <p>
     outlines, two weeks from today. If it isn't--" His gesture was a menace.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If it is--well, you'll be suitably rewarded. And no leaks, now. Not a
    </p>
    <p>
     word of this to any one, understand? If it gets out, you know what I can
    </p>
    <p>
     do to you, and will! Remember Roswell; remember Parker Hayes. _They_ let
    </p>
    <p>
     news get to the Dillingham-Saunders people, about the new Tezzoni
    </p>
    <p>
     radio-electric system--and one's dead, now, a suicide; the other's in
    </p>
    <p>
     Sing-Sing for eighteen years. Remember that--and keep your mouth shut!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. I understand."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right, then. A fortnight from today, report to me here. And mind
    </p>
    <p>
     you, have something to report, or--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well! Now, go!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus dismissed, Herzog gathered together his books and papers, blinked a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment with those peculiar wall-eyes of his, arose and, bowing first to
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint and then to the keenly-watching Waldron, backed out of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the door had closed behind him, Flint turned to his partner with a
    </p>
    <p>
     nervous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's the way to get results, eh?" he exclaimed. "No dilly-dallying
    </p>
    <p>
     and no soft soap; but just lay the lash right on, hard--they jump then,
    </p>
    <p>
     the vermin! Results! That fellow will work his head off, the next two
    </p>
    <p>
     weeks; and there'll be something doing when he comes again. You'll see!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron laughed nonchalantly. Once more the mask of indifference had
    </p>
    <p>
     fallen over him, veiling the keen, incisive interest he had shown during
    </p>
    <p>
     the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Something doing, yes," he drawled, puffing his cigar to a glow. "Only I
    </p>
    <p>
     advise you to choose your men. Some day you'll try that on a real
    </p>
    <p>
     man--one of the rough-necks you know, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint snapped his fingers contemptuously, gazed at Waldron a moment with
    </p>
    <p>
     unwinking eyes and tugged at his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When I need advice on handling men, I'll ask for it," he rapped out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, glancing at the Louis XIV clock: "Past the time for that C.P.S.
    </p>
    <p>
     board-meeting, Wally. No more of this, now. We'll talk it over at the
    </p>
    <p>
     Country Club, tonight; but for the present, let's dismiss it from our
    </p>
    <p>
     minds."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right!" answered the other, and arose, yawning, as though the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     subject were of but indifferent interest to him. "It's all moonshine,
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint. All a pipe-dream. Defoe's philosophers, who spent their lives
    </p>
    <p>
     trying to extract sunshine from cucumbers, never entertained any more
    </p>
    <p>
     fantastic notion than this of yours. However, it's your funeral, not
    </p>
    <p>
     mine. You're paying for it. I decline to put in any funds for any such
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose. Amuse yourself; you've got to settle the bill."
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint smiled sourly, his gold tooth glinting, but made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come along," said his partner, moving toward the door. "They're waiting
    </p>
    <p>
     for us, already, at the board meeting. And there's big business coming
    </p>
    <p>
     up, today--that strike situation, you remember. Slade's going to be on
    </p>
    <p>
     deck. We've got to decide, at once, whether or not we're going to turn
    </p>
    <p>
     him loose on the miners, to smash that gang of union thugs and Socialist
    </p>
    <p>
     fanatics, and do it right. _That's_ a game worth playing, Flint; but
    </p>
    <p>
     this Air Trust vagary of yours--stuff and nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, for all reply, merely cast a strange look at his partner, with
    </p>
    <p>
     those strongly-contracted pupils of his; and so the two vultures of prey
    </p>
    <p>
     betook themselves to the board room where already, round the long
    </p>
    <p>
     rosewood table, Walter Slade of the Cosmos Detective Company was laying
    </p>
    <p>
     out his strike-breaking plans to the attentive captains of industry.

     CHAPTER IV.
    </head>
    <p>
     AN INTERLOPER.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the eleventh day after this interview between the two men who,
    </p>
    <p>
     between them, practically held the whole world in their grasp, Herzog
    </p>
    <p>
     telephoned up from Oakwood Heights and took the liberty of informing
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint that his experiments had reached a point of such success that he
    </p>
    <p>
     prayed Flint would condescend to visit the laboratories in person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, after some reflection, decided he would so condescend; and
    </p>
    <p>
     forthwith ordered his limousine from his private garage on William
    </p>
    <p>
     Street. Thereafter he called Waldron on the 'phone, at his Fifth Avenue
    </p>
    <p>
     address.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mr. Waldron is not up, yet, sir," a carefully-modulated voice answered
    </p>
    <p>
     over the wire. "Any message I can give him, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, hello! That you, Edwards?" Flint demanded, recognizing the suave
    </p>
    <p>
     tones of his partner's valet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right. Tell Waldron I'll call for him in half an hour with the
    </p>
    <p>
     limousine. And mind, now, I want him to be up and dressed! We're going
    </p>
    <p>
     down to Staten Island. Got that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. Any other message, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No. But be sure you get him up, for me! Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirty minutes later, Flint's chauffeur opened the door of the big
    </p>
    <p>
     limousine, in front of the huge Renaissance pile that Waldron's
    </p>
    <p>
     millions had raised on land which had cost him more than as though he
    </p>
    <p>
     had covered it with double eagles; and Flint himself ascended the steps
    </p>
    <p>
     of Pentelican marble. The limousine, its varnish and silver-plate
    </p>
    <p>
     flashing in the bright spring sun, stood by the curb, purring softly to
    </p>
    <p>
     itself with all six cylinders, a thing of matchless beauty and rare
    </p>
    <p>
     cost. The chauffeur, on the driver's seat, did not even bother to shut
    </p>
    <p>
     off the gas, but let the engine run, regardless. To have stopped it
    </p>
    <p>
     would have meant some trifling exertion, in starting again; and since
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint never considered such details as a few gallons of gasoline, why
    </p>
    <p>
     should _he_ care? Lighting a Turkish cigarette, this aristocrat of labor
    </p>
    <p>
     lolled on the padded leather and indifferently--with more of contempt
    </p>
    <p>
     than of interest--regarded a swarm of iron-workers, masons and laborers
    </p>
    <p>
     at work on a new building across the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, meanwhile, had entered the great mansion, its bronze
    </p>
    <p>
     doors--ravished from the Palazzo Guelfo at Venice--having swung inward
    </p>
    <p>
     to admit him, with noiseless majesty. Ignoring the doorman, he addressed
    </p>
    <p>
     himself to Edwards, who stood in the spacious, mahogany-panelled hall,
    </p>
    <p>
     washing both hands with imaginary soap.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Waldron up, yet, Edwards?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, sir. He--er--I have been unable--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The devil! Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "In his apartments, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take me up!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "He said, sir," ventured Edwards, in his smoothest voice. "He said--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't give a damn what he said! Take me up, at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. Immediately, sir!" And he gestured suavely toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint strode down the hall, indifferent to the Kirmanshah rugs, the rare
    </p>
    <p>
     mosaic floor and stained-glass windows, the Parian fountain and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Azeglio tapestries that hung suspended up along the stairway--all old
    </p>
    <p>
     stories to him and as commonplace as rickety odds and ends of furniture
    </p>
    <p>
     might be to any toiler "cribbed, cabin'd and confined" in fetid East
    </p>
    <p>
     Side tenement or squalid room on Hester Street.
    </p>
    <p>
     The elevator boy bowed before his presence. Edwards hesitated to enter
    </p>
    <p>
     the private elevator, with this world-master; but Flint beckoned him to
    </p>
    <p>
     come along. And so, borne aloft by the smooth force of the electric
    </p>
    <p>
     motor, they presently reached the upper floor where "Tiger" Waldron
    </p>
    <p>
     laired in stately splendor, like the nabob that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without ceremony, Flint pushed forward into the bed-chamber of the
    </p>
    <p>
     mighty one--a chamber richly finished in panels of the rare sea-grape
    </p>
    <p>
     tree, brought from Pacific isles at great cost of money and some
    </p>
    <p>
     expenditure of human lives; but this latter item was, of course, beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the softened light which entered through rich curtains, one saw the
    </p>
    <p>
     famous frieze of De Lussac, that banded the apartment, over the
    </p>
    <p>
     panelling--the frieze of Bacchantes, naked and unashamed, revelling with
    </p>
    <p>
     Satyrs in an abandon that bespoke the age when the world was young.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their voluptuous forms entwined with clustering grapes and leaves, they
    </p>
    <p>
     poured tipsy libations of red wine from golden chalices; while old
    </p>
    <p>
     Silenus, god of drink, astride a donkey, applauded with maudlin joy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, however, had no eyes for this scene which would have gladdened a
    </p>
    <p>
     voluptuary's heart--and which, for that reason was dear to Waldron--but
    </p>
    <p>
     walked toward the huge, four-posted bed where Wally himself, now rather
    </p>
    <p>
     paler than usual, with bloodshot eyes, was lying. This bed, despite the
    </p>
    <p>
     fact that it had been transported all the way from Tours, France, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that it once had belonged to an archbishop, had only too often witnessed
    </p>
    <p>
     its owner's insomnia.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm! You're a devil of a man to keep an appointment, aren't you?" Flint
    </p>
    <p>
     sneered at the master of the house. "Eleven o'clock, and not up, yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pardon me for remarking, my dear Flint," replied Waldron, stretching
    </p>
    <p>
     himself between the silken sheets and reaching for a cigarette, "that
    </p>
    <p>
     the appointment was not of my making. Also that I was up, last
    </p>
    <p>
     night--this morning, rather--till three-thirty. And in the next place,
    </p>
    <p>
     that scoundrel Hazeltine, trimmed me out of eighty-six thousand in four
    </p>
    <p>
     hours--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Roulette again, you idiot?" demanded Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And in conclusion," said Wally, "that the bigness of my head and the
    </p>
    <p>
     brown taste in my mouth are such as no 'soda and sermons, the morning
    </p>
    <p>
     after' can possibly alleviate. So you understand my dalliance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn those workmen!" he exclaimed, with sudden irritation, as a louder
    </p>
    <p>
     chattering of pneumatic riveters from the new building all at once
    </p>
    <p>
     clattered in at the window. "A free country, eh? And men are permitted
    </p>
    <p>
     to make _that_ kind of a racket when a fellow wants to sleep! By God, if
    </p>
    <p>
     I--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Drop that, Wally, and get up!" commanded Flint. "There's no time for
    </p>
    <p>
     this kind of thing today. Herzog has just informed me his experiments
    </p>
    <p>
     have brought results. We're going down to Oakwood Heights to sea a few
    </p>
    <p>
     things for ourselves. And the quicker you get dressed and in your right
    </p>
    <p>
     mind, the better. Come along, I tell you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Still chasing sunbeams from cucumbers, eh?" drawled the magnate,
    </p>
    <p>
     inhaling cigarette smoke and blowing a thin cloud toward the wanton
    </p>
    <p>
     Bacchantes. He affected indifference, but his dull eyes brightened a
    </p>
    <p>
     trifle in his wan face, deep-lined by the savage dissipations of the
    </p>
    <p>
     previous night. "And you insist on dragging me out on the same fatuous
    </p>
    <p>
     errand?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't be an ass!" snapped the Billionaire. "Get up and come along. The
    </p>
    <p>
     sooner we have this thing under way, the better."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right, anything to oblige," conceded Waldron, inwardly stirred by
    </p>
    <p>
     an interest he took good care not to divulge in word or look. "Give me
    </p>
    <p>
     just time for a cold plunge, a few minutes with my masseur and my
    </p>
    <p>
     barber, a bite to eat and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint laid hold on his partner and shook him roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Move, you sluggard!" he commanded. And Tiger Waldron obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forty-five minutes later, the two financiers were speeding down the
    </p>
    <p>
     asphalt of the avenue at a good round clip. Flint's gleaming car formed
    </p>
    <p>
     one unit of the never-ending procession of motors which, day and night,
    </p>
    <p>
     year in and year out, spin unceasingly along the great, hard, splendid,
    </p>
    <p>
     cruel thoroughfare.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I tell you," Flint was asserting as they swung into Broadway, at
    </p>
    <p>
     Twenty-third Street, and headed for South Ferry, "I tell you, Wally,
    </p>
    <p>
     the thing is growing vaster and more potent every moment. The longer I
    </p>
    <p>
     look at it, the huger its possibilities loom up! With air under our
    </p>
    <p>
     control, as a source of manufacturing alone, we can pull down perfectly
    </p>
    <p>
     inconceivable fortunes. We shan't have to send anywhere for our raw
    </p>
    <p>
     material. It will come to us; it's everywhere. No cost for
    </p>
    <p>
     transportation, to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
     "With oxygen, nitrogen and liquid air as products, think of the
    </p>
    <p>
     possibilities, will you? Not an ice-plant in the country could compete
    </p>
    <p>
     with us, in the refrigerating line. With liquid air, we could sweep that
    </p>
    <p>
     market clean. By installing it on our fruit cars and boats, and our beef
    </p>
    <p>
     cars, the saving effected in many ways would run to millions. The sale
    </p>
    <p>
     of nitrogen, for fertilizer, would net us billions. And, above all, the
    </p>
    <p>
     control of the world's air supply, for breathing, would make us the
    </p>
    <p>
     absolute, undisputed masters of mankind!
    </p>
    <p>
     "We'd have the world by the windpipe. Its very life-breath would be at
    </p>
    <p>
     our disposal. Ha! What about revolution, then? What about popular
    </p>
    <p>
     discontent, and stiff-necked legislators, and cranky editors? What about
    </p>
    <p>
     commercial and financial rivals? What about these damned Socialists,
    </p>
    <p>
     with their brass-lunged bazoo, howling about monopoly and capitalism and
    </p>
    <p>
     all the rest of it? Eh, what? Just one squeeze," here Flint closed his
    </p>
    <p>
     corded, veinous fingers, "just one tightening of the fist, and--all
    </p>
    <p>
     over! We win, hands down!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Like shutting the wind off from a runaway horse, eh?" suggested
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, squinting at his cigar as though to hide the involuntary gleam
    </p>
    <p>
     of light that sparkled in his narrow-set eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Precisely!" assented Flint, smiling his gold-toothed smile. "The
    </p>
    <p>
     wildest bolter has got to stop, or fall dead, once you close his
    </p>
    <p>
     nostrils. That's what we'll do to the world, Wally. We'll get it by the
    </p>
    <p>
     throat--and there you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, there we are," repeated Waldron, "but--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "But what, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron did not answer, for a moment, but squinted up at the tall
    </p>
    <p>
     buildings, temples of Mammon and of Greed, filled from pave to cornice
    </p>
    <p>
     with toiling, sweated hordes of men and women, all laboring for
    </p>
    <p>
     Capitalism; many of them, directly or indirectly, for him. Then, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     limousine slowed at Spring Street, to let a cross-town car pass--a car
    </p>
    <p>
     whose earnings he and Flint both shared, just as they shared those of
    </p>
    <p>
     every surface and subway and "L" car in the vast metropolis--he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you weighed the consequences carefully, Flint? Quite carefully?
    </p>
    <p>
     This thing of cornering all the oxygen is a pretty big proposition. Do
    </p>
    <p>
     you think you really ought to undertake it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you considered the frightful suffering and loss of life it might
    </p>
    <p>
     entail? Almost certainly would entail? Are you quite sure you _want_ to
    </p>
    <p>
     take the world by the throat and--and choke it? For money?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, not for money, Waldron. We're both staggering under money, as it
    </p>
    <p>
     is. But power! Ah, that's different!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know," admitted Waldron. "But ought we--you--to attempt this, even
    </p>
    <p>
     for the sake of universal power? Your plan contemplates a monopoly such
    </p>
    <p>
     that everybody who refused or was unable to buy your product would, at
    </p>
    <p>
     best, have to get along with vitiated air, and at worst would have to
    </p>
    <p>
     stifle. Do you really think we ought to undertake this?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Keenly he eyed Flint, as he thus sounded the elder man's inhuman
    </p>
    <p>
     determination. Flint, fathoming nothing of his purpose, retorted with
    </p>
    <p>
     some heat:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ha! Getting punctilious, all at once, are you? Talk ethics, eh? Where
    </p>
    <p>
     were your scruples, a year ago, when people were paying 25 cents a loaf
    </p>
    <p>
     for bread, because of that big wheat pool you put through? How about the
    </p>
    <p>
     oil you've just lately helped me boost by a 20 per cent. increase? And
    </p>
    <p>
     when the papers--though mostly those infernal Socialist or Anarchist
    </p>
    <p>
     papers, or whatever they were--shouted that old men and women were
    </p>
    <p>
     freezing in attics, last winter, what then? Did you vote to arbitrate
    </p>
    <p>
     the D.K. coal strike? Not by a jugful! You stood shoulder to shoulder
    </p>
    <p>
     with me, then, Wally, while _now_--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's a bit different, now," interposed "Tiger," with an evil smile,
    </p>
    <p>
     still leading his partner along. "Since then I've had the--ah--the
    </p>
    <p>
     extreme happiness to become engaged to your daughter, Catherine. New
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughts have entered my mind. I've experienced a--a--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You quitter!" burst out Flint. "No, by God! you aren't going to put
    </p>
    <p>
     this thing over on me. I'll have no quitter for _my_ son-in-law! Wally,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm astonished at you. Astonished and disappointed. You're not yourself,
    </p>
    <p>
     this morning. That eighty-six thousand you dropped last night, has
    </p>
    <p>
     shaken your heart. Come, come, pull together! Where's your nerve, man?
    </p>
    <p>
     Where's your nerve?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron answered nothing. In silence the partners watched the press of
    </p>
    <p>
     traffic, each busy with his own thoughts, Waldron waiting for Flint to
    </p>
    <p>
     reopen fire on him, and the Billionaire decided to say no more till his
    </p>
    <p>
     associate should make some move. Thus the limousine reached the Staten
    </p>
    <p>
     Island ferry, that glorious monument of municipal ownership wrecked by
    </p>
    <p>
     Tammany grafting. In silence they smoked while the car rolled down the
    </p>
    <p>
     incline and out onto the huge ferry boat. Then, as the crowded craft got
    </p>
    <p>
     under way, a minute later, both men left the car and strolled to the
    </p>
    <p>
     rail to watch the glittering sparkle of the sunlight on the harbor; the
    </p>
    <p>
     teeming commerce of the port; the creeping liners and busy tugs; the
    </p>
    <p>
     towering figure of Liberty, her flameless torch held far aloft in
    </p>
    <p>
     mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly Waldron spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can't do it, I tell you!" said he, waving an eloquent hand toward
    </p>
    <p>
     the sky. "It's too big, the air is, as I said before. Too damned big!
    </p>
    <p>
     Own coal and copper, if you will, and steel and ships, here; own those
    </p>
    <p>
     buildings back there," with a gesture at the frowning line of
    </p>
    <p>
     skyscrapers buttressing Manhattan, "but don't buck the impossible! And
    </p>
    <p>
     incidentally, Flint, don't misunderstand me, either. When I asked you if
    </p>
    <p>
     we _ought_ to try it, I merely meant, would it be _safe_? The world,
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, is a dangerous toy to play with, too hard. The people are
    </p>
    <p>
     perilous baubles, if you step on their corns a bit too often or too
    </p>
    <p>
     heavily. Every Caesar has a Brutus waiting for him somewhere, with a
    </p>
    <p>
     club.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Once let the unwashed get an idea into their low brows, and you can't
    </p>
    <p>
     tell where it may lead them. Even a rat fights, in its last corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     These human rats of ours have been getting a bit nasty of late. True,
    </p>
    <p>
     they swallowed the Limited Franchise Bill, three years ago, with only a
    </p>
    <p>
     little futile protest, so that now we've got them politically hamstrung.
    </p>
    <p>
     True, there's the Dick Military Bill, recently enlarged and perfected,
    </p>
    <p>
     so they can't move a hand without falling into treason and
    </p>
    <p>
     court-martial. True again, they've stood for the Censorship and the
    </p>
    <p>
     National Mounted Police--the Grays--all in the last year. But how much
    </p>
    <p>
     more will they stand, eh? You close your hand on their windpipes, and by
    </p>
    <p>
     God! something may happen even yet, after all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint snapped his fingers with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Machine guns!" was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, of course," answered Waldron. "But there may be life in the old
    </p>
    <p>
     beast yet. They may yet kick the apple cart over--and us with it. You
    </p>
    <p>
     never can tell. And those infernal Socialists, always at it, night and
    </p>
    <p>
     day, never letting up, flinging firebrands into the powder magazine!
    </p>
    <p>
     _Sometime_ there's going to be one hell of a bang, Flint! And when it
    </p>
    <p>
     comes, _suave qui peut_! So go slow, old man--go damned slow, that's all
    </p>
    <p>
     I've got to say!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "On the contrary," said Flint, blinking in the golden spring sunshine as
    </p>
    <p>
     he peered out over the swashing brine at a raucous knot of gulls, "on
    </p>
    <p>
     the contrary, Wally, I'm going to push it as fast as the Lord will let
    </p>
    <p>
     me. You can come in, or not, as you see fit--but remember this, no
    </p>
    <p>
     quitter ever gets a daughter of mine! And another thing; we're in the
    </p>
    <p>
     year 1921, now, not 1910 or 1915. Developments, political and otherwise,
    </p>
    <p>
     have moved swiftly, these few years past. Then, there might have been
    </p>
    <p>
     trouble. To-day, there can't be. We've got things cinched too tight for
    </p>
    <p>
     that!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ten years ago, they might have had our blood, the people might, or
    </p>
    <p>
     given us a hemp-tea party in Wall Street. today, all's safe. Come, be
    </p>
    <p>
     a man and grip your courage! We can put the initial stages through in
    </p>
    <p>
     absolute secrecy--and then, once we get our clutch on the world's
    </p>
    <p>
     breath, what have we to fear?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go slow, Flint!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nonsense! Oxygen is life itself. There's no substitute. Vitiate the air
    </p>
    <p>
     by removing even 10 per cent. of it, and the world will lick our boots
    </p>
    <p>
     for a chance to breathe! Everybody's got to have oxygen, all the way
    </p>
    <p>
     from kings and emperors down to the toiling cattle, the Henry Dubbs, as
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe they're commonly called in vulgar speech. Shut off the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     and 'the captains and the kings' will run to heel like the rabble
    </p>
    <p>
     itself. Run to heel, and pay for the privilege of doing it! We've got
    </p>
    <p>
     the universities, press, churches, laws, judges, army and navy and
    </p>
    <p>
     everything already in our hands. We'll be secure enough, no fear!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shhhhh!" And Waldron nudged the Billionaire with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
     In his excitement, Flint had permitted his voice to rise, a little. Not
    </p>
    <p>
     far from him, leaning on the rail, a stockily built young fellow in
    </p>
    <p>
     overalls, a cap pulled down firmly over his well-shaped head, was
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently watching the gulls and the passing boats, with eyes no less
    </p>
    <p>
     blue than the bay itself; eyes no less glinting than the sunlight on the
    </p>
    <p>
     waves. He seemed to be paying no heed to anything but what lay before
    </p>
    <p>
     him. But "Tiger" Waldron, possessed of something of the instinct of the
    </p>
    <p>
     beast whose name he bore, subconsciously sensed a peril in his nearness.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man's ear--if unusually quick--might, just _might_ possibly have
    </p>
    <p>
     caught a word or two meant for no interloper. And at that thought,
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron once more nudged his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shhh!" he repeated, "Enough. We can finish this, in the limousine."
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint looked at him a moment, in silence, then nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right you are," said he. And both men climbed back into the closed car.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You never can tell what ears are primed for news," said Waldron.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Better take no chances."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Before long, we can throw away all subterfuge," the Billionaire replied
    </p>
    <p>
     as he shut the door. "But for now, well, you're correct. Once our grasp
    </p>
    <p>
     tightens on the windpipe of the world, we're safe. From our office in
    </p>
    <p>
     Wall Street you and I can play the keys of the world-machine as an
    </p>
    <p>
     organist would finger his instrument. But there must be no leak; no
    </p>
    <p>
     publicity; no suspicion aroused. We'll play our music _pianissimo_,
    </p>
    <p>
     Wally, with rare accompaniments to the tune of 'great public utility,
    </p>
    <p>
     benefit to the public health,' and all that--the same old game, only on
    </p>
    <p>
     a vastly larger scale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Every modern composer in the field of Big Business knows that score and
    </p>
    <p>
     has played it many times. _We_ will play it on a monstrous pipe organ,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the world's lungs for bellows and the world's breath to vibrate our
    </p>
    <p>
     reeds--and all paying tribute, night and day, year after year, all over
    </p>
    <p>
     the world, Wally, all over the world!
    </p>
    <p>
     "God! What power shall be ours! What infinite power, such as, since time
    </p>
    <p>
     began, never yet lay in mortal hands! We shall be as gods, Waldron, you
    </p>
    <p>
     and I--and between us, we shall bring the human race wallowing to our
    </p>
    <p>
     feet in helpless bondage, in supreme abandon!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The ferry boat, nearing the Staten Island landing, slowed its ponderous
    </p>
    <p>
     screws. The chauffeur flung away his cigarette, drew on his gauntlets
    </p>
    <p>
     and accelerated his engine. Forward the human drove began to press,
    </p>
    <p>
     under the long slave-driven habit of haste, of eagerness to do the
    </p>
    <p>
     masters' bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
     The young mechanic by the rail--he of the overalls and keen blue
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes--turned toward the bows, picked up a canvas bag of tools and stood
    </p>
    <p>
     there waiting with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment his glance rested on the limousine and the two half-seen
    </p>
    <p>
     figures within. As it did so, a wanton breeze from off the Island
    </p>
    <p>
     flapped back the lapel of his jumper. In that brief instant one might
    </p>
    <p>
     have seen a button pinned upon his blue flannel shirt--clasped hands,
    </p>
    <p>
     surrounded by the legend: "Workers of the World, Unite!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But neither of the plutocrats observed this; nor, had they seen, would
    </p>
    <p>
     they have understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     And whether the sturdy toiler had overheard aught of their infernal
    </p>
    <p>
     conspiring--or, having heard it, grasped its dire and criminal
    </p>
    <p>
     significance--who, who in all this weary and toil-burdened world, could
    </p>
    <p>
     say?

     IN THE LABORATORY.

    <p>
     Half an hour's run down Staten Island, along smooth roads lined with
    </p>
    <p>
     sleepy little towns and through sparse woods beyond which sparkled the
    </p>
    <p>
     shining waters of the harbor, brought the two plutocrats to the quiet

     Now the blasÃ© chauffeur swung the car sharply to the left, past the
    </p>
    <p>
     aviation field, and so came to the wide-scattered settlement--almost a
    </p>
    <p>
     colony--which, hidden behind high, barb-wire-topped fences, carried on
    </p>
    <p>
     the many and complex activities of the partners' experiment station.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here were the several laboratories where new products were evolved and
    </p>
    <p>
     old ones refined, for Flint's and Waldron's greater profit. Here stood a
    </p>
    <p>
     complete electric power plant, for lighting and heating the works, as
    </p>
    <p>
     well as for current to use in the retorts and many powerful machines of
    </p>
    <p>
     the testing works.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, again, were broad proving grounds, for fuel and explosives; and,
    </p>
    <p>
     at one side, stood a low, skylighted group of brick buildings, known as
    </p>
    <p>
     the electro-chemical station. Dormitories and boarding-houses for the
    </p>
    <p>
     small army of employees occupied the eastern end of the enclosure,
    </p>
    <p>
     nearest the sea. Over all, high chimney stacks and the aerials of a
    </p>
    <p>
     mighty wireless plant dominated the entire works. A private railroad
    </p>
    <p>
     spur pierced the western side of the enclosure, for food and coal
    </p>
    <p>
     supplies, as well as for the handling of the numerous imports and
    </p>
    <p>
     exports of this wonderfully complete feudal domain. As the colony lay
    </p>
    <p>
     there basking in the sunshine of early spring, under its drifting
    </p>
    <p>
     streamers of smoke, it seemed an ideal picture of peaceful activities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here a locomotive puffed, shunting cars; there, a steam-jet flung its
    </p>
    <p>
     plumes of snowy vapor into air; yonder, a steam hammer thundered on a
    </p>
    <p>
     massive anvil. And forges rang, and through open windows hummed sounds
    </p>
    <p>
     of industry.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, not one of all those sounds but echoed more bitter slavery for
    </p>
    <p>
     men. Not one of all those many activities but boded ill to humanity. For
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole plan and purpose of the place was the devising of still wider
    </p>
    <p>
     forms of human exploitation and enslavement. Its every motive was to
    </p>
    <p>
     serve the greed of Flint and Waldron. Outwardly honest and industrious,
    </p>
    <p>
     it inwardly loomed sinister and terrible, a type and symbol of its
    </p>
    <p>
     masters' swiftly growing power. Such, in its essence, was the great
    </p>
    <p>
     experiment station of these two men who lusted for dominion over the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the long, glittering car drew up at the main gate of the enclosure, a
    </p>
    <p>
     sharp-eyed watchman peered through a sliding wicket therein. Satisfied
    </p>
    <p>
     by his inspection, he withdrew; and at once the big gate rolled back,
    </p>
    <p>
     smoothly actuated by electricity. The car purred onward, into the
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosure. When the gate had closed noiselessly behind it, the chauffeur
    </p>
    <p>
     ran it down a splendidly paved roadway, swung to the right, past the
    </p>
    <p>
     machine shops, and drew it to a stand in front of the administration
    </p>
    <p>
     building.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint and his partner alighted, and stood for a moment surveying the
    </p>
    <p>
     scene with satisfaction. Then Flint turned to the chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Put the car in the garage," he directed. "We may not want it till
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
     The blasÃ© one touched his cap and nodded, in obedience. Then, as the car
    </p>
    <p>
     withdrew, the partners ascended the broad steps.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good chap, that Herrick," commented Waldron, casting a glance at the
    </p>
    <p>
     retreating chauffeur. "Quick-witted, and mum. Give me a man who knows
    </p>
    <p>
     how to mind _and_ keep still about it, every time!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right," assented Flint. "Obedience is the first of all virtues, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     second is silence. Well, it looks to me as though we had the whole world
    </p>
    <p>
     coming our way, now, along that very same path of virtue. Once we get
    </p>
    <p>
     this air proposition really to working, the world will obey. It will
    </p>
    <p>
     have to! And as for silence, we can manage that, too. The mere turn of a
    </p>
    <p>
     valve, and--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron smiled grimly, as though in derision of what he seemed to think
    </p>
    <p>
     his partner's chimerical hopes, but made no answer. Together they
    </p>
    <p>
     entered the administration building. Five minutes later, Herzog, their
    </p>
    <p>
     servile experimenter, stood bowing and cringing before them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Got it, Herzog?" demanded Flint, while Waldron lighted still another of
    </p>
    <p>
     those costly cigars--each one worth a good mechanic's daily wage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir, I believe so, sir," the scientist replied, depreciatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That is, at least, on a small scale. Two weeks was the time you allowed
    </p>
    <p>
     me, sir, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know. You've done it in eleven days," interrupted, the Billionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well. I knew you could. You'll lose nothing by it. So no more of
    </p>
    <p>
     that. Show us what you've done. Everything all ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quite ready, sir," the other answered. "If you'll be so good as to step
    </p>
    <p>
     into the electro-chemical building?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint very graciously signified his willingness thus to condescend; and
    </p>
    <p>
     without delay, accompanied by the still incredulous Waldron, and
    </p>
    <p>
     followed by Herzog, he passed out of the administration building,
    </p>
    <p>
     through a covered passage and into the electro-chemical works.
    </p>
    <p>
     A variety of strange odors and stranger sounds filled this large brick
    </p>
    <p>
     structure, windowless on every side and lighted only by broad skylights
    </p>
    <p>
     of milky wire-glass--this arrangement being due to the extreme secrecy
    </p>
    <p>
     of many processes here going forward. The partners had no intention that
    </p>
    <p>
     any spying eyes should ever so much as glimpse the work in this
    </p>
    <p>
     department; work involving foods, fuels, power, lighting, almost the
    </p>
    <p>
     entire range of the vast network of exploiting media they had already
    </p>
    <p>
     flung over a tired world.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This way, gentlemen," ventured Herzog, pointing toward a metal door at
    </p>
    <p>
     the left of the main room. He unlocked this, which was guarded by a
    </p>
    <p>
     combination lock, like that of a bank vault, and waited for them to
    </p>
    <p>
     enter; then closed it after them, and made quite sure the metal door was
    </p>
    <p>
     fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     A peculiar, pungent smell greeted the partners' nostrils as they glanced
    </p>
    <p>
     about the inner laboratory. At one side an electric furnace was glowing
    </p>
    <p>
     with graphite crucibles subjected to terrific heat. On the other a
    </p>
    <p>
     dynamo was humming. Before them a broad, tiled bench held a strange
    </p>
    <p>
     assortment of test tubes, retorts and complex apparatus of glass and
    </p>
    <p>
     gleaming metal. The whole was lighted by a strong white light from
    </p>
    <p>
     above, through the milk-hued glass--one of Herzog's own inventions, by
    </p>
    <p>
     the way; a wonderful, light-intensifying glass, which would bend but not
    </p>
    <p>
     break; an invention which, had he himself profited by it, would have
    </p>
    <p>
     brought him millions, but which the partners had exploited without ever
    </p>
    <p>
     having given him a single penny above his very moderate salary.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that it?" demanded Flint, a glitter lighting up his
    </p>
    <p>
     morphia-contracted pupils. He jerked his thumb at a complicated nexus of
    </p>
    <p>
     tubes, brass cylinders, coiled wires and glistening retorts which stood
    </p>
    <p>
     at one end of the broad work-bench.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That is it, sir," answered Herzog, apologetically, while "Tiger"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron's hard face hardened even more. "Only an experimental model, you
    </p>
    <p>
     understand, sir, but--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It gets results?" queried Flint sharply. "It produces oxygen and
    </p>
    <p>
     nitrogen on a scale that indicates success, with adequate apparatus?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. I believe so, sir. No doubt about it; none whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good!" exclaimed the Billionaire. "Now show us!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "With pleasure, sir. But first, let me explain, a little."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, what?" demanded Flint. His partner, meanwhile, had drawn near the
    </p>
    <p>
     apparatus, and was studying it with a most intense concentration. Plain
    </p>
    <p>
     to see, beneath this man's foppish exterior and affected cynicism, dwelt
    </p>
    <p>
     powerful purposes and keen intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Explain what?" repeated the Billionaire. "As far as details go, I'm not
    </p>
    <p>
     interested. All I want is results. Go ahead, Herzog; start your machine
    </p>
    <p>
     and let me see what it can do."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will, sir," acceded the scientist. "But first, with your permission,
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll point out a few of its main features, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn the main features!" cried Flint. "Get busy with the
    </p>
    <p>
     demonstration!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hold on, hold on," now interrupted Waldron. "Let him discourse, if he
    </p>
    <p>
     wants to. Ever know a scientist who wasn't primed to the muzzle with
    </p>
    <p>
     expositions? Here, Herzog," he added, turning to the inventor, "I'll
    </p>
    <p>
     listen, if nobody else will."
    </p>
    <p>
     Undecided, Herzog smiled nervously. Even Flint had to laugh at his
    </p>
    <p>
     indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right, go on," said the Billionaire. "Only for God's sake, make it
    </p>
    <p>
     brief!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog, thus adjured, cleared his throat and blinked uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oxygen," he said. "Yes, I can produce it quickly, easily and in large
    </p>
    <p>
     quantities. As a gas, or as a liquid, which can be shipped to any
    </p>
    <p>
     desired point and there transformed into gaseous form. Liquid air can
    </p>
    <p>
     also be produced by this same machine, for refrigerating purposes. You
    </p>
    <p>
     understand, of course, that when liquid air evaporates, it is only the
    </p>
    <p>
     nitrogen that goes back into the atmosphere at 313 degrees below zero.
    </p>
    <p>
     The residue is pure liquid oxygen. In other words, this apparatus will
    </p>
    <p>
     make money as a liquid air plant, and furnish you oxygen as a
    </p>
    <p>
     by-product.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It will also turn out nitrogen, for fertilizing purposes. The income
    </p>
    <p>
     from a full-sized machine, on this pattern, from all three sources,
    </p>
    <p>
     should be very large indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good," put in Waldron. "And liquid air, for example, would cost how
    </p>
    <p>
     much to produce?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "With power-cost at half a cent per H.P. hour, about $2.50 a ton. The
    </p>
    <p>
     oxygen by-product alone will more than pay for that, in purifying and
    </p>
    <p>
     cooling buildings, or used to promote combustion in locomotives and
    </p>
    <p>
     other steam engines. The liquid air itself can be used as a motive power
    </p>
    <p>
     for a certain type of expansion engine, or--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There, there, that's enough!" interposed Flint, brusquely. "We don't
    </p>
    <p>
     need any of your advice or suggestions, Herzog. As far as the disposal
    </p>
    <p>
     of the product is concerned, we can take care of that. All we want from
    </p>
    <p>
     you is the assurance that that product can be obtained, easily and
    </p>
    <p>
     cheaply, and in unlimited quantities. Is that the case?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right. And can liquid oxygen be easily transported any considerable
    </p>
    <p>
     distance?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. In what is known as Place's Vacuum-jacketed Insulated
    </p>
    <p>
     Container, it can be kept for weeks at a time without any appreciable
    </p>
    <p>
     loss."
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint pondered a moment, then asked, again:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Could large tanks, holding say, a million gallons, be built on that
    </p>
    <p>
     principle, for wholesale storage? And could vacuum-jacketed pipes be
    </p>
    <p>
     laid, for conveying liquid oxygen or its gas?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No reason why not, sir. Yes, I may say all that is quite feasible."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well, then," snapped Flint. "That's enough for the present. Now,
    </p>
    <p>
     show us your machine at work! Start it Herzog. Let's see what you can
    </p>
    <p>
     do!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The Billionaire's eyes glittered as Herzog laid a hand on a gleaming
    </p>
    <p>
     switch. Even Waldron forgot to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gentlemen, observe," said Herzog, as he threw the lever.
    </p>

     CHAPTER VI.
    </head>
    <p>
     OXYGEN, KING OF INTOXICATORS.
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft humming note began to vibrate through the inner laboratory--a
    </p>
    <p>
     note which rose in pitch, steadily, as Herzog shoved the lever from one
    </p>
    <p>
     copper post to another, round the half-circle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am now heating the little firebrick furnace," said the scientist. "In
    </p>
    <p>
     Norway, they use an alternating current of only 5,000 volts, between
    </p>
    <p>
     water-cooled copper electrodes, as I have already told you. I am using
    </p>
    <p>
     30,000 volts, and my electrodes, my own invention, are--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Never mind," growled Flint. "Just let's see some of the product--some
    </p>
    <p>
     liquid oxygen, that's all. The why and wherefore is your job, not ours!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog, with a pained smile, bent and peered through a red glass
    </p>
    <p>
     bull's-eye that now had begun to glow in the side of his apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The arc is good," he muttered, as to himself. "Now I will throw in the
    </p>
    <p>
     electro-magnets and spread it; then switch in my intensifying condenser,
    </p>
    <p>
     and finally set the turbine fans to work, to throw air through the
    </p>
    <p>
     field. Then we shall see, we shall see!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suiting the action to the words, he deftly touched here a button, there
    </p>
    <p>
     a lever; and all at once a shrill buzzing rose above the lower drone of
    </p>
    <p>
     the induction coils.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gentlemen," said Herzog, straightening up and facing his employers,
    </p>
    <p>
     "the process is now already at work. In five minutes--yes, in three--I
    </p>
    <p>
     shall have results to show you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good!" grunted Waldron. "That's all we're after, results. That's the
    </p>
    <p>
     only way you hold your job, Herzog, just getting results!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He relighted his cigar, which had gone out during Herzog's
    </p>
    <p>
     explanation--for "Tiger" Waldron, though he could drop thousands at
    </p>
    <p>
     roulette without turning a hair, never yet had been known to throw away
    </p>
    <p>
     a cigar less than half smoked. Flint, meanwhile, took out a little
    </p>
    <p>
     morocco-covered note book and made a few notes. In this book he had kept
    </p>
    <p>
     an outline of his plan from the very first; and now with pleasure he
    </p>
    <p>
     added some memoranda, based on what Herzog had just told him, as well as
    </p>
    <p>
     observations on the machine itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus two minutes passed, then three.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Time's up, Herzog!" exclaimed Waldron, glancing at the electric clock
    </p>
    <p>
     on the wall. "Where's the juice?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "One second, sir," answered the scientist. Again he peeked through the
    </p>
    <p>
     glowing bull's-eye. Then, his face slightly pale, his bulging eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     blinking nervously, he took two small flint glass bottles, set them
    </p>
    <p>
     under a couple of pipettes, and deftly made connections.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oxygen cocktail for mine," laughed Waldron, to cover a certain emotion
    </p>
    <p>
     he could not help feeling at sight of the actual operation of a process
    </p>
    <p>
     which might, after all, open out ways and means for the utter
    </p>
    <p>
     subjugation of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither Flint nor the inventor vouchsafed even a smile. The Billionaire
    </p>
    <p>
     drew near, adjusted a pair of pince-nez on his hawk-like nose, and
    </p>
    <p>
     peered curiously at the apparatus. Herzog, with a quick gesture, turned
    </p>
    <p>
     a small silver faucet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oxygen! Unlimited oxygen!" he exclaimed. "I have found the process,
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemen, commercially practicable. Oxygen!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as he spoke, a lambent, sparkling liquid began to flow through the
    </p>
    <p>
     pipette, into the flask. At sight of it, the Billionaire's eyes lighted
    </p>
    <p>
     up with triumph. Waldron, despite his assumed nonchalance, felt the
    </p>
    <p>
     hunting thrill of Wall street, the quick stab of exultation when victory
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed well in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "These bottles," said Herzog, "are double, constructed on the principle
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Thermos bottle. They will keep the liquid gases I shall show you,
    </p>
    <p>
     for days. Huge tanks could be built on the same principle. In a short
    </p>
    <p>
     time, gentlemen, you can handle tons of these gases, if you
    </p>
    <p>
     like--thousands of tons, unlimited tons.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Siemens and Halske people, and the Great Falls, S.C., plant, will
    </p>
    <p>
     be mere puttering experimenters beside you. For neither they nor any
    </p>
    <p>
     other manufacturers have any knowledge of the vital process--my secret,
    </p>
    <p>
     polarizing transformer, which does the work in one-tenth the time and at
    </p>
    <p>
     one-hundredth the cost of any other known process. For example, see
    </p>
    <p>
     here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He turned the faucet, disconnected the flask and handed it to Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There, sir," he remarked, "is a half-pint of pure liquid oxygen, drawn
    </p>
    <p>
     from the air in less than eight minutes, at a cost of perhaps two-tenths
    </p>
    <p>
     of a cent. On a large scale the cost can be vastly reduced. Are you
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfied, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint nodded, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You'll do, Herzog," he replied--his very strongest form of
    </p>
    <p>
     commendation. "You're not half bad, after all. So this is liquid oxygen,
    </p>
    <p>
     eh? Very cheap, and very cold?"
    </p>
    <p>
     His eyes gleamed with joy at sight of the translucent potent stuff--the
    </p>
    <p>
     very stuff of life, its essence and prime principle, without which
    </p>
    <p>
     neither plant nor animal nor man can live--oxygen, mother of all life,
    </p>
    <p>
     sustainer of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very cheap, yes, sir," answered the scientist. "And cold, enormously
    </p>
    <p>
     cold. The specimen you hold in your hand, in that vacuum-protected
    </p>
    <p>
     flask, is more than three hundred degrees below zero. One drop of it on
    </p>
    <p>
     your palm would burn it to the bone. Incidentally, let me tell you
    </p>
    <p>
     another fact--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And that is?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "This specimen is the allotropic or condensed form of oxygen, much more
    </p>
    <p>
     powerful than the usual liquified gas."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ozone, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Precisely. Would you like to sense its effect as a ventilating agent?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No danger?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "None, sir. Here, allow me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog took the flask, pressed a little spring and liberated the top. At
    </p>
    <p>
     once a whitish vapor began to coil from the neck of the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm!" grunted Waldron, smiling. "Mountain winds and sea breezes have
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing on that!" He sniffed with appreciation. "Some gas, all right!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're right, Wally," answered the Billionaire. "If this works out on a
    </p>
    <p>
     large scale, in all its details--well--I needn't impress its importance
    </p>
    <p>
     on you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Yielding to the influence of the wonderful, life-giving gas, the rather
    </p>
    <p>
     close air of the laboratory, contaminated by a variety of chemical
    </p>
    <p>
     odors, and vitiated by its recent loss of oxygen, had begun to freshen
    </p>
    <p>
     and purify itself in an astonishing manner. One would have thought that
    </p>
    <p>
     through an open window, close at hand, the purest ocean breeze was
    </p>
    <p>
     blowing. A faint tinge of color began to liven the somewhat pasty cheek
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Billionaire. Waldron's big chest expanded and his eye brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the meek Herzog stood straighter and looked more the man, under the
    </p>
    <p>
     stimulus of the life-giving ozone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fine!" exclaimed Flint, with unwonted enthusiasm, and nearly yielded to
    </p>
    <p>
     a laugh. Waldron went so far as to slap Herzog on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're some wizard, old man!" he exclaimed, with a warmth hitherto
    </p>
    <p>
     never known by him--for already the subtle gas was beginning to
    </p>
    <p>
     intoxicate his senses. "And you can handle nitrogen with the same ease
    </p>
    <p>
     and precision?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Exactly," answered Herzog. "This other vial contains pure nitrogen.
    </p>
    <p>
     With enlarged apparatus, I can supply it by the trainload. The world's
    </p>
    <p>
     fertilizer problem is solved!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Great work!" ejaculated Waldron, even more excited than before, but
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, his natural sourness asserting itself, merely growled some
    </p>
    <p>
     ungracious remark.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nitrogen can go hang," said he. "It's oxygen we're after, primarily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once we get our grip on that, the world will be--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron checked him just in time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Enough of this," he interrupted sharply. "I admit, I'm not myself, in
    </p>
    <p>
     this rich atmosphere. I know _you're_ feeling it, already, Flint. Come
    </p>
    <p>
     along out of this, where we can regain our aplomb. We've seen enough,
    </p>
    <p>
     for once."
    </p>
    <p>
     He turned to Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
     "For God's sake, man," cried he, "cork that magic bottle of yours,
    </p>
    <p>
     before all the oxygen-genii escape, or you'll have us both under the
    </p>
    <p>
     table! And, see here," he added, pulling out his check-book, while Flint
    </p>
    <p>
     stared in amazed disgust. "Here, take a blank check." He took his
    </p>
    <p>
     fountain pen and scrawled his name on one. "The amount? That's up to
    </p>
    <p>
     you. Now, let us out," he bade, as Herzog stood there regarding the
    </p>
    <p>
     check with entire uncomprehension. "Out, I say, before I get
    </p>
    <p>
     extravagant!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog, perfectly comprehending the magnates' unusual conduct as due to
    </p>
    <p>
     oxygen-intoxication in its initial stage, made no comment, but walked to
    </p>
    <p>
     the door, spun the combination and flung it open.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Glad to have had the pleasure of demonstrating the process to you,
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemen," said he. "If you're convinced it's practicable, I'm at your
    </p>
    <p>
     orders for any larger extension of the work. Have you any other question
    </p>
    <p>
     or suggestion?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither magnate answered. Flint was trying hard to hold his
    </p>
    <p>
     self-control. Waldron, red-faced now and highly stimulated, looked as
    </p>
    <p>
     though he had been drinking even more than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both passed out of the laboratory with rather unsteady steps. Together
    </p>
    <p>
     they retraced their way to the administration building; and there, safe
    </p>
    <p>
     at last in the private inner office, with the door locked, they sat down
    </p>
    <p>
     and stared at each other with expressions of amazement.

     CHAPTER VII.
    </head>
    <p>
     A FREAK OF FATE.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron was the first to speak. With a sudden laugh, boisterous and
    </p>
    <p>
     wild, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Flint, you old scoundrel, you're drunk!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Drunk yourself!" retorted the Billionaire, half starting from his
    </p>
    <p>
     chair, his fist clenched in sudden passion. "How dare you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dare? I dare anything!" exclaimed Waldron. "Yes, I admit it--I _am_
    </p>
    <p>
     half seas over. That ozone--God! what a stimulant! Must be some
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderfully powerful form. If we--could market it--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint sank back in his chair, waving an extravagant hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Market it?" he answered. "Of course we can market it, and will! Drunk
    </p>
    <p>
     or sober, Wally, I know what I'm talking about. The power now in our
    </p>
    <p>
     grasp has never yet been equalled on earth. On the one side, we can
    </p>
    <p>
     half-stifle every non-subscriber to our service, or wholly stifle every
    </p>
    <p>
     rebel against us. On the other, we can simply saturate every subscriber
    </p>
    <p>
     with health and energy, or even--if they want it--waft them to paradise
    </p>
    <p>
     on the wings of ozone. The old Roman idea of 'bread and circus' to rule
    </p>
    <p>
     the mob, was child's play compared to this! Science has delivered the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole world into our hands. Power, man, power! Absolute, infinite power
    </p>
    <p>
     over every living, breathing thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He fell silent, pondering the vast future; and Waldron, gazing at him
    </p>
    <p>
     with sparkling eyes, nodded with keen satisfaction. Thus for a few
    </p>
    <p>
     moments they sat, looking at each other and letting imagination ran
    </p>
    <p>
     riot; and as they sat, the sudden, stimulating effect of the condensed
    </p>
    <p>
     oxygen died in their blood, and calmer feelings ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently Waldron spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let's get down to brass tacks," said he, drawing his chair up to the
    </p>
    <p>
     table. "I'm almost myself again. The subtle stuff has got out of my
    </p>
    <p>
     brain, at last. Generalities and day-dreams are all very well, Flint,
    </p>
    <p>
     but we've got to lay out some definite line of campaign. And the sooner
    </p>
    <p>
     we get to it the better."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm!" sneered Flint. "If it's not more practical than your action in
    </p>
    <p>
     giving Herzog that blank check, it won't be worth much. As an
    </p>
    <p>
     extravagant action, Wally, I've never seen it equalled. I'm astonished,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron laughed easily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't worry," he answered his partner. "That temporary aberration of
    </p>
    <p>
     judgment, due to oxygen-stimulus, will have no results. Herzog won't
    </p>
    <p>
     dare fill out the check, anyhow, because he knows he'd get into trouble
    </p>
    <p>
     if he did; and even though he should, he can collect nothing. I'll have
    </p>
    <p>
     payment stopped, at once, on that number. No danger, Flint!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know," mused the Billionaire. "It may be that this man has us
    </p>
    <p>
     just a little under his thumb. He, and he alone, understands the
    </p>
    <p>
     process. We've got to treat him with due consideration, or he may leave
    </p>
    <p>
     us and carry his secret to others--to Masterson, for instance, or the
    </p>
    <p>
     Amalgamated people, or--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing doing on that, old man!" interrupted "Tiger." "Have no fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first move he makes, off to Sing Sing he goes, the way we jobbed
    </p>
    <p>
     Parker Hayes. Slade and the Cosmos Agency can take care of _him_, all
    </p>
    <p>
     right, if he asserts himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very likely," answered Flint, who had now at last entirely recovered
    </p>
    <p>
     his sang-froid. "But in that event, our work would be at a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Waldron, we mustn't oppose this fellow. Better let the check go
    </p>
    <p>
     through, if he has nerve enough to fill it out and cash it. He won't
    </p>
    <p>
     dare gouge very deep; and no matter what he takes, it won't be a drop in
    </p>
    <p>
     the ocean, compared to the golden flood now almost within our grasp!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron pondered a moment, then nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right. Correct," he finally answered. "So then, we can dismiss that
    </p>
    <p>
     trifle from our minds. Now, to work! We've got the process we were
    </p>
    <p>
     after. What next?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "First of all," answered the Billionaire, "we'll let this Herzog
    </p>
    <p>
     understand that he's to have a share in the results; that in this, as in
    </p>
    <p>
     everything so far, he's merely a tool--and that when tools lose their
    </p>
    <p>
     cutting edge we break 'em. He's a meek devil. We can hold _him_ easily
    </p>
    <p>
     enough."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right. And then?" asked Waldron.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then? First of all, a good, big, wide-sweeping publicity campaign. That
    </p>
    <p>
     must begin today, to prepare opinion for the forthcoming development of
    </p>
    <p>
     the new idea."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Henderson can handle that, all right," said Wally, leaning forward in
    </p>
    <p>
     his chair. "Give him the idea, and turn him loose, and he'll get
    </p>
    <p>
     results. A clever dog, that. He and his press bureau, working through
    </p>
    <p>
     all the big dailies and many of the magazines, can turn this country
    </p>
    <p>
     upside down in six months. Let him get on this job, and before you know
    </p>
    <p>
     it the public will be demanding, be fighting for a chance to subscribe
    </p>
    <p>
     to the new ventilating-service. That part of it is easy!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, you're right," replied Flint. "We'll see Henderson no later than
    </p>
    <p>
     this afternoon. He and his writers can lay out a series of popular
    </p>
    <p>
     articles and advertisements, to be run as pure reading matter, with no
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguishing mark that they _are_ ads, which will get the country--the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole world, in fact--coming our way."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good," the other assented. "Meantime, we can begin installing oxygen
    </p>
    <p>
     machines on a big scale, a huge scale, to supply the demand that's bound
    </p>
    <p>
     to arise. Where do you think we'd best manufacture? Herzog says water
    </p>
    <p>
     power is the correct thing. We might use Niagara--use some of the
    </p>
    <p>
     surplus power we already own there."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Niagara would do, very well," answered Flint. He had once more taken
    </p>
    <p>
     out his little morocco-covered note book, and was now jotting down some
    </p>
    <p>
     further memoranda. "It's a good location. Pipe-lines could easily be
    </p>
    <p>
     extended, from it, to cover practically a quarter to a third of the
    </p>
    <p>
     United States. Eventually we'll put in another plant in Chicago, one in
    </p>
    <p>
     Denver and one on the Pacific Coast. Then, in time, there must be
    </p>
    <p>
     distributing centers in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. But for the
    </p>
    <p>
     present, we'll begin with the Niagara plant. After we get that under
    </p>
    <p>
     full operation, the others will develop in due course of time."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Our charter covers this new line of work. There will be no need of any
    </p>
    <p>
     legal technicalities," said Waldron, with a smile. "Some charter, if I
    </p>
    <p>
     do say it, who shouldn't. I drew it, you remember. Nothing much in the
    </p>
    <p>
     way of possible business-extension got past _me_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're right," he answered. "Nothing stands in our way, now. Positively
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing. We have land, power and capital without limit. We have the
    </p>
    <p>
     process. We control press, law, courts, judges, military and every other
    </p>
    <p>
     form of government. All we need look out for is to secure public
    </p>
    <p>
     confidence and keep the bandage on the eyes of the world till our system
    </p>
    <p>
     is actually in operation--then there will be no redress, no come back,
    </p>
    <p>
     no possible rebellion. As I've already said, Wally, we'll have the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     world by the windpipe; and let the mob howl _then_, if they dare!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, let 'em howl!" chimed in "Tiger," with a snarl that proved his
    </p>
    <p>
     nickname no misnomer. "Inside of a year we'll have them all where we
    </p>
    <p>
     want them. You were right, Flint, when you called oil, coal, iron and
    </p>
    <p>
     all the rest of it mere petty activities. Air--ah! that's the talk! Once
    </p>
    <p>
     we get the _air_ under our control, we're emperors of all life!"
    </p>
    <p>
     His words rang frank and bold, but something in his look, as he blinked
    </p>
    <p>
     at his partner, might have given Flint cause for uneasiness, had the
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire noticed that oblique and dangerous glance. One might have
    </p>
    <p>
     read therein some shifty and devious plan of Waldron's to dominate even
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint himself, to rule the master or to wreck him, and to seize in his
    </p>
    <p>
     own hands the reins of universal power. But Flint, bending over his
    </p>
    <p>
     note-book and making careful memoranda, saw nothing of all this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, an inveterate smoker, lighted a fresh cigar, leaned back,
    </p>
    <p>
     surveyed his partner and indulged in a short inner laugh, which hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     curved his cruel lips, but which hardened still more those pale-blue,
    </p>
    <p>
     steely eyes of his.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right," said he, at last. "Enough of this, Flint. Let's get back to
    </p>
    <p>
     town, now, and have a conference with Henderson. That's the first step.
    </p>
    <p>
     By tonight, the whole campaign of publicity must be mapped out. Come,
    </p>
    <p>
     come; you can finish your memoranda later. I'm impatient to be back in
    </p>
    <p>
     Wall Street. Come along!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Five minutes later, having left orders that Herzog was to attend upon
    </p>
    <p>
     them in their private offices, next morning, they had ordered the
    </p>
    <p>
     limousine and were making way along the hard road toward the gate of the
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gate opened to let them pass, then swung and locked again, behind
    </p>
    <p>
     them. At a good clip, the powerful car picked up speed on the homeward
    </p>
    <p>
     way. The two magnates, exultant and flushed with the consciousness of
    </p>
    <p>
     coming victory, lolled in the deeply-cushioned seat and spoke of power.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they swung past the aviation field and neared the Oakwood Heights
    </p>
    <p>
     station, a train pulled out. Down the road came tramping a workingman in
    </p>
    <p>
     overalls and jumper, with a canvas bag of tools swinging from his brawny
    </p>
    <p>
     right hand. As he walked, striding along with splendid energy, he
    </p>
    <p>
     whistled to himself--no cheap ragtime air, but Handel's Largo, with an
    </p>
    <p>
     appreciation which bespoke musical feeling of no common sort.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Billionaire caught sight of him, just as the car slowed to take the
    </p>
    <p>
     sharp turn by the station. Instant recognition followed. Flint's eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     narrowed sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm! The same fellow," he grunted to himself. "The same rascal who stood
    </p>
    <p>
     beside us on the ferry boat, as we were talking over our plans. Now,
    </p>
    <p>
     what the devil?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Shadowed by a kind of instinctive uneasiness, not yet definite or clear
    </p>
    <p>
     but more in the nature of a premonition of trouble, Flint gazed fixedly
    </p>
    <p>
     at the mechanic as the car swung round the bend in the road. The glance
    </p>
    <p>
     was returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yielding to some kind of imperative curiosity, the Billionaire leaned
    </p>
    <p>
     over the side of the car--leaned out, with his coat flapping in the
    </p>
    <p>
     stiff wind--and for a moment peered back at the disquieting workman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the car swept him out of sight, and Flint resumed his seat again.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did not know--for he had not seen it happen--that in that moment the
    </p>
    <p>
     slippery, leather-covered note-book had slid from his lolling coat
    </p>
    <p>
     pocket and had fallen with a sharp slap on the white macadam, skidded
    </p>
    <p>
     along and come to rest in the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
     The workingman, however, who had paused and turned to look after the
    </p>
    <p>
     speeding car, _he_ had seen all this.
    </p>
    <p>
     A moment he stood there, peering. Then, retracing his steps with
    </p>
    <p>
     resolution he picked up the little book and slid it into the pocket of
    </p>
    <p>
     his jeans.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deserted was the road. Not a soul was to be seen, save the crossing
    </p>
    <p>
     flagman, musing in his chair beside his little hut, quite oblivious to
    </p>
    <p>
     everything but a rank cob pipe. The workman's act had not been noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nobody had observed him. Nobody knew. Not a living creature had
    </p>
    <p>
     witnessed the slight deed on which, by a strange freak of fate, the
    </p>
    <p>
     history of the world was yet to turn.

    <p>
     ONE UNBIDDEN, SHARES GREAT SECRETS.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately on discovering his loss--which was soon after having reached
    </p>
    <p>
     his office--Flint, in something like a fright, telephoned down to the
    </p>
    <p>
     Oakwood Heights laboratory and instructed Herzog, in person, to make a
    </p>
    <p>
     careful search for it and to report results inside an hour. Even though
    </p>
    <p>
     some of the essentials of his plan were written in a code of his own
    </p>
    <p>
     devising, Flint paled before the possible results should the book fall
    </p>
    <p>
     into the hands of anybody intelligent enough to fathom its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn the luck!" he ejaculated, pacing the office floor, his fists
    </p>
    <p>
     knotted. "If it had been a pocket book with a few thousand inside, that
    </p>
    <p>
     would have been a trifle. But to lose my plan of campaign--God grant no
    </p>
    <p>
     harm may come of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, slyly observing him, could not suppress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Calling on God, eh?" sneered he. "You _must_ be agitated. I haven't
    </p>
    <p>
     heard that kind of entreaty on your lips, Flint, since the year of the
    </p>
    <p>
     big coal strike, when you prayed God the gun-men might 'get' the
    </p>
    <p>
     strikers before they could organize. Come, come, man, brace up! Your
    </p>
    <p>
     book will turn up all right; and even if it doesn't there's no cause for
    </p>
    <p>
     alarm. It would take a man of extraordinary acumen to read _your_
    </p>
    <p>
     hieroglyphics! Cheer up, Flint. There's really nothing to excite you."
    </p>
    <p>
     The Billionaire thus adjured, sat down and tried to calm his agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rotten luck, eh?" he queried. "But after all, Herzog is likely to find
    </p>
    <p>
     the book. And even if he doesn't, I guess we're safe enough. The very
    </p>
    <p>
     boldness of the plan--supposing even that the finder could grasp
    </p>
    <p>
     it--would put it outside the seeming range of the possible. It's hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     a hundred to one shot any harm may come of it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right, then, let it go at that," said Waldron. "And now, to
    </p>
    <p>
     business. Suppose, for example, you've got a perfectly unlimited supply
    </p>
    <p>
     of oxygen-gas and liquid. How are you going to market it? Just what
    </p>
    <p>
     details have you worked out?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint pondered a moment, before replying. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course you understand, Wally, I can't give you every point. The
    </p>
    <p>
     whole thing will be an evolution, and new ideas and processes, new uses
    </p>
    <p>
     and demands will develop as time passes. But in the main, my idea is
    </p>
    <p>
     this: The big producing stations will steadily extract oxygen from the
    </p>
    <p>
     atmosphere, thus leaving the air increasingly poorer and less adapted to
    </p>
    <p>
     sustaining human life.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I shall store the oxygen in vast tanks, like the ordinary gas-tanks to
    </p>
    <p>
     be found in every city, only much bigger. These tanks will be fed by
    </p>
    <p>
     pipe-lines from the central stations, thus."
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint drew toward him a sheet of his heavily embossed letter-paper, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     picking up a pencil, began to sketch a rough diagram. Waldron, making no
    </p>
    <p>
     comment, followed every stroke with keen interest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "From these tanks," the Billionaire continued, "smaller pipes will
    </p>
    <p>
     convey the gaseous oxygen to every house taking our service."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just like ordinary gas?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Precisely. Each room will be fitted with an oxygen jet apparatus,
    </p>
    <p>
     something like a gas burner, with a safety device to prevent over supply
    </p>
    <p>
     and avoid the dangers of combustion."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Combustion?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes. In pure oxygen, a glowing bit of wire will burst into flame. Your
    </p>
    <p>
     cigar, there, would catch fire, from the merest spark in its inmost
    </p>
    <p>
     folds. Too much oxygen in a room not only intoxicates the
    </p>
    <p>
     occupants--we've already seen _that_ effect--but also develops a great
    </p>
    <p>
     fire risk. So we shall have to make some provision for that, Wally. It
    </p>
    <p>
     will be absolutely essential."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right. Allowing it's been made, what then?" asked "Tiger," with
    </p>
    <p>
     extraordinary interest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't you see? We'll have every household under our absolute thumb?"
    </p>
    <p>
     And Flint pressed his thumb on the table to illustrate. "My God, man,
    </p>
    <p>
     think of it! Every city honeycombed by our pipes--yes, and every village
    </p>
    <p>
     and hamlet too, and even every farm house that can afford it! At first,
    </p>
    <p>
     the cost will be very low, till people have become accustomed to ozone
    </p>
    <p>
     as they are to water. The whole ventilation problem will be solved, at
    </p>
    <p>
     once and for all time. Where we can't pipe in the ozone, we can use
    </p>
    <p>
     portable vaporizers, to be supplied once a month, and of sufficient
    </p>
    <p>
     capacity to keep the air of an average-sized house perfectly pure for
    </p>
    <p>
     thirty days.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pure? More than pure! Exhilarating, life-giving, delicious! Under this
    </p>
    <p>
     system, Wally, the middle and upper classes will thrive as never
    </p>
    <p>
     before. They'll grow in size and weight, in health and intelligence,
    </p>
    <p>
     under the steady influence of ozone, day and night. Every vital process
    </p>
    <p>
     will be stimulated. Our invention will mark a new era in the welfare of
    </p>
    <p>
     the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bunk!" sneered Wally. "That's all very well for your prospectuses and
    </p>
    <p>
     newspaper articles, old man, but the fact is we don't give a damn
    </p>
    <p>
     whether it helps the world or wrecks it. We're out for money and power.
    </p>
    <p>
     My motto is, Get 'em and do good, if you can--but _get_ 'em anyhow! So
    </p>
    <p>
     you had better can the philanthropic part of it. Just show me the cash,
    </p>
    <p>
     and you can have all the credit!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint shot a grim look at his partner, then continued:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't be flippant, Wally. This is a serious business and must be
    </p>
    <p>
     treated as such. In addition to the respiratory service, we can put in
    </p>
    <p>
     water-cooling and refrigerating services, at low cost, also cold-pipes
    </p>
    <p>
     for cooling houses in summer. In fine, we can immeasurably add to the
    </p>
    <p>
     health and comfort of the better classes; and can at last have everybody
    </p>
    <p>
     using our gas, which, registering through our own sealed meters, will
    </p>
    <p>
     flood us with wealth so vast as to make that of these Standard Oil
    </p>
    <p>
     pifflers look like the proverbial thirty cents!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fine!" exclaimed Waldron, nodding approval. "Also, any time any
    </p>
    <p>
     rebellion develops we can merely shut off the supply in that quarter,
    </p>
    <p>
     and quickly reduce it. Or, again, we can increase the potency of the
    </p>
    <p>
     gas, and fairly intoxicate the people, till they stand for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just fancy, now, our pipes connected with the sacred Halls of Congress
    </p>
    <p>
     and with the White House! Even if any difficulty could possibly be
    </p>
    <p>
     expected from these sources, just imagine how quickly we could nip it in
    </p>
    <p>
     the bud!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quickly isn't the word, Wally," answered the Billionaire. "I tell you,
    </p>
    <p>
     old man, the world lies in our hands, today. And we have only to close
    </p>
    <p>
     our fingers, in order to possess it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He glanced at his own fingers, as though he visibly perceived the great
    </p>
    <p>
     world lying there for him to squeeze. Waldron's eyes, following the
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire's, saw that Flint's hand was trembling, and understood the
    </p>
    <p>
     reason. More than three hours had passed--nay, almost four--since Flint
    </p>
    <p>
     had had any opportunity to take his necessary dose of morphia. Waldron
    </p>
    <p>
     arose, paced to the window and stood there looking out over the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     panorama of city, river and harbor, apparently absorbed in
    </p>
    <p>
     contemplation, but really keen to hear what Flint might do.
    </p>
    <p>
     His expectations were not disappointed. Hardly had he turned his back,
    </p>
    <p>
     when he heard the desk-drawer open, furtively, and knew the Billionaire
    </p>
    <p>
     was taking out the little vial of white tablets, dearer to him than ever
    </p>
    <p>
     the caress of woman to a Don Juan. A moment later, the drawer closed
    </p>
    <p>
     again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He'll do now, for a while," thought Waldron, with satisfaction. "Let
    </p>
    <p>
     him go the limit, if he likes--the fool! The more he takes, the quicker
    </p>
    <p>
     I win. It'll kill him yet, the dope will. And _that_ means, my mastery
    </p>
    <p>
     of the world will be complete. Let him go it! The harder, the better!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He turned back toward Flint, again, veiling in that impenetrable face of
    </p>
    <p>
     his the slightest hint or expression which might have told Flint that he
    </p>
    <p>
     understood the Billionaire's vice. If Flint were Vulture, Waldron was
    </p>
    <p>
     Tiger, indeed. And so, for a brief moment, these two soulless men of
    </p>
    <p>
     gold and power stood eyeing each other, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly Waldron spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's one thing you've forgotten to speak of, Flint," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And that is?" demanded the other, already calmed by the quick action of
    </p>
    <p>
     the subtle, enslaving drug.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The effect on the world's poor--on the toiling millions! The results of
    </p>
    <p>
     this innovation, in slum, and slave-quarter, and in the haunts of
    </p>
    <p>
     poverty. Your talk has all been of the middle and upper classes, and of
    </p>
    <p>
     the benefits accruing to them, from increased oxygen-consumption. But
    </p>
    <p>
     how about the others? Every ounce of oxygen you take out of the air,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaves it just so much poorer. Store thousands of tons of the
    </p>
    <p>
     life-giving gas, in monster tanks, and you vitiate the entire
    </p>
    <p>
     atmosphere. How about that? How can even the well-to-do breathe, then,
    </p>
    <p>
     out-doors, to say nothing of the poverty-stricken millions?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint grimaced, showing a glint of his gold tooth--his substitute for a
    </p>
    <p>
     smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's all reckoned for," he answered. "I thought I made it quite
    </p>
    <p>
     clear, in our previous talk. To begin with, we will withdraw the oxygen
    </p>
    <p>
     from the atmosphere so slowly that at first there won't be any
    </p>
    <p>
     noticeable effect on the out-door air. For a while, the only thing that
    </p>
    <p>
     will be noticed by the world will be that our gas service, to private
    </p>
    <p>
     residences and institutions, will result in greatly increased comfort
    </p>
    <p>
     and health to the better classes. And the cost will be so low--at first,
    </p>
    <p>
     mind you, only at first--that every family of any means at all can take
    </p>
    <p>
     it. In fact, Wally, we can afford practically to give away the service,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the first year, until we get our grip firmly fixed on the throat of
    </p>
    <p>
     the world. Do you get the idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron nodded, as he drew leisurely on his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Practical to a degree," he answered. "That is, until the poor begin to
    </p>
    <p>
     gasp for breath. But what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the time the outer atmosphere really begins to show the effect of
    </p>
    <p>
     withdrawing a considerable percentage of the oxygen," Flint answered,
    </p>
    <p>
     "we will have our pocket respirators on the market. Well-to-do people
    </p>
    <p>
     will as soon think of going out without their shoes, as they will with
    </p>
    <p>
     their respirators. No, there won't be any visible tubes or attachments,
    </p>
    <p>
     Wally. Nothing of that kind. Only, each person will carry a properly
    </p>
    <p>
     insulated cake of solidified oxygen that will evaporate through the
    </p>
    <p>
     special apparatus and surround him with a normally rich atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
     And--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, but the poor? The workers? What of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Devil take _them_, if it comes to that!" retorted Flint, with some
    </p>
    <p>
     heat. "Who ever gives them any serious attention, as it is? Who bothers
    </p>
    <p>
     about their health? They eat and drink and breathe the leavings,
    </p>
    <p>
     anyhow--eat the cheapest and most adulterated food, drink the vilest
    </p>
    <p>
     slop and breathe the most vitiated slum air. Nobody cares, except
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps those crazy Socialists that once in a while get up on the
    </p>
    <p>
     street-corner and howl about the rights of man and all that rubbish!
    </p>
    <p>
     Working-class? What do _I_ care about the cattle? Let them die, if they
    </p>
    <p>
     want to! D'you suppose, for one minute, I'm going to limit or delay this
    </p>
    <p>
     big innovation, because there's a working-class that may suffer?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "They'll do more than suffer, Flint, if you seriously depreciate the
    </p>
    <p>
     atmosphere. They'll die!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, let them, and be damned to them!" retorted Flint, already
    </p>
    <p>
     showing symptoms of drug-stimulation. Waldron, smoking meanwhile, eyed
    </p>
    <p>
     him with a dangerous smile lurking in his cold eyes. "Let them, I say!
    </p>
    <p>
     They die off, now, twice or thrice as fast as the better classes, but
    </p>
    <p>
     what difference does it make? Great breeders, those people are. The more
    </p>
    <p>
     they die, the faster they multiply. Let them go their way and do as they
    </p>
    <p>
     like, so long as they don't interfere with _us_! The only really
    </p>
    <p>
     important factor to reckon on is this, that with an impoverished air to
    </p>
    <p>
     breathe, their rebellious spirit will die out--the dogs!--and we'll have
    </p>
    <p>
     no more talk of social revolution. We'll draw their teeth, all right
    </p>
    <p>
     enough; or rather, twist the bowstring round their damned necks so tight
    </p>
    <p>
     that all their energy, outside of work, will be consumed in just keeping
    </p>
    <p>
     alive. Revolution, then? Forget it, Waldron! We'll kill _that_ viper
    </p>
    <p>
     once and for all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good idea, Flint," the other replied, with approbation. "Only a
    </p>
    <p>
     master-mind like yours could have conceived it. I'm with you, all right
    </p>
    <p>
     enough. Only, tell me--do you really believe we can put this whole
    </p>
    <p>
     program through, without a hitch? Without a leak, anywhere? Without
    </p>
    <p>
     barricades in the streets, wild-eyed agitators howling, machine-guns
    </p>
    <p>
     chattering, and Hell to pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wait and see!" he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe you're right," his partner answered. "But slow and easy is the
    </p>
    <p>
     only way."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Slow and easy," Flint assented. "Of course we can't go too fast. In
    </p>
    <p>
     1850, for example, do you suppose the public would have tolerated the
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden imposition of monopolies? Hardly! But now they lie down under
    </p>
    <p>
     them, and even vote and fight to keep them! So, too, with this Air
    </p>
    <p>
     Trust. Time will show you I'm right."
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Long past lunch-time, Flint," said he. "Enough of this, for now. And
    </p>
    <p>
     this afternoon, I've got that D.&amp;nbsp;K. &amp; E. directors' meeting on
    </p>
    <p>
     hand. When shall we go on with our plans, and get down to specific
    </p>
    <p>
     details?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "This evening, say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well. At my house?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No. Too noisy. Run out to Englewood, to mine. We'll be quiet there. And
    </p>
    <p>
     come early, Waldron. We've no end of things to discuss. The quicker we
    </p>
    <p>
     get the actual work under way, now, the better. You can see Catherine,
    </p>
    <p>
     too. Isn't that an inducement?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus ended the conference. It resumed, that night, in Flint's luxurious
    </p>
    <p>
     study at "Idle Hour," his superb estate on the Palisades. Waldron paid
    </p>
    <p>
     only a perfunctory court to Catherine, who manifested her pleasure by
    </p>
    <p>
     studied indifference. Both magnates felt relieved when she withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had other and larger matters under way than any dealing with the
    </p>
    <p>
     amenities of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Until past midnight the session in the study lasted, under the soft glow
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Billionaire's reading-light. And many choice cigars were smoked,
    </p>
    <p>
     many sheets of paper covered with diagrams and calculations, many vast
    </p>
    <p>
     schemes of conquest expanded, ere the two masters said good-night and
    </p>
    <p>
     separated.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the very hour of Waldron's leave-taking, another man was pondering
    </p>
    <p>
     deeply, studying the problem from quite another angle, and--no less
    </p>
    <p>
     earnestly, than the two magnates--laying careful plans.
    </p>
    <p>
     This man, sturdy, well-built and keen, smoked an old briar as he
    </p>
    <p>
     worked. A flannel shirt, open at the throat, showed a well-sinewed neck
    </p>
    <p>
     and powerful chest. Under the inverted cone of a shaded incandescent in
    </p>
    <p>
     his room, at the electricians' quarters of the Oakwood Heights
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosure, one could see the deep lines of thought and careful study
    </p>
    <p>
     crease his high and prominent brow.
    </p>
    <p>
     From time to time he gazed out through the open window, off toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     whispering lines of surf on the eastern shores of Staten Island--the
    </p>
    <p>
     surf forever talking, forever striving to give its mystic message to the
    </p>
    <p>
     unheeding ear of man. And as he gazed, his blue eyes narrowed with the
    </p>
    <p>
     intensity of his thought. Once, as though some sudden understanding had
    </p>
    <p>
     come to him, he smote the pine table with a corded fist, and swore below
    </p>
    <p>
     his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was past two in the morning when he finally rose, stretched, yawned
    </p>
    <p>
     and made ready for sleep on his hard iron bunk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can it be?" he muttered, as he undressed. "Can it be possible, or am I
    </p>
    <p>
     dreaming? No--this is no dream! This is reality; and thank God, I
    </p>
    <p>
     understand."
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, before he extinguished his light, he took from the table the
    </p>
    <p>
     material he had been studying over, and put it beneath his pillow, where
    </p>
    <p>
     he could guard it safe till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing he thus protected was none other than a small note-book,
    </p>
    <p>
     filled with diagrams, jottings and calculations, and bound in red
    </p>
    <p>
     morocco covers.
    </p>
    <p>
     That night, at Englewood--in the Billionaire's home and in the
    </p>
    <p>
     workman's simple room at Oakwood Heights--history was being made.
    </p>
    <p>
     The outcome, tragic and terrible, who could have foreseen?

     CHAPTER IX.
    </head>
    <p>
     DISCHARGED.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost all the following morning, working at his bench in the
    </p>
    <p>
     electro-chemical laboratories of the great Oakwood Heights plant,
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel Armstrong pondered deeply on the problems and responsibilities
    </p>
    <p>
     now opening out before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The finding of that little red-leather note-book, he fully understood,
    </p>
    <p>
     had at one stroke put him in possession of facts more vital to the
    </p>
    <p>
     labor-movement and the world at large than any which had ever developed
    </p>
    <p>
     since the very beginning of Capitalism. A Socialist to the backbone,
    </p>
    <p>
     thoroughly class-conscious and dowered with an incisive intellect,
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel thrilled at thought that he, by chance, had been chosen as the
    </p>
    <p>
     instrument through which he felt the final revolution now must work. And
    </p>
    <p>
     though he remained outwardly calm, as he bent above his toil, inwardly
    </p>
    <p>
     he was aflame. His heart throbbed with an excitement he could scarce
    </p>
    <p>
     control. His brain seemed on fire; his soul pulsed with savage joy and
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificent inspiration. For he was only four-and-twenty, and the bitter
    </p>
    <p>
     grind of years and toil had not yet worn his spirit down nor quelled the
    </p>
    <p>
     ardor of his splendid strength and optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
     Working at his routine labor, his mind was not upon it. No, rather it
    </p>
    <p>
     dwelt upon the vast discovery he had made--or seemed to have made--the
    </p>
    <p>
     night before. Clearly limned before his vision, he still saw the notes,
    </p>
    <p>
     the plans, the calculations he had been able to decipher in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire's lost note-book--the note-book which now, deep in the
    </p>
    <p>
     pocket of his jumper that hung behind him on a hook against the wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     drew his every thought, as steel draws the compass-needle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Incredible, yet true!" he pondered, as he filed a brass casting for a
    </p>
    <p>
     new-type dynamo. "These men are plotting to strangle the world to
    </p>
    <p>
     death--to strangle, if they cannot own and rule it! And, what's more, I
    </p>
    <p>
     see nothing to prevent their doing it. The plan is sound. They have the
    </p>
    <p>
     means. At this very moment, the whole human race is standing in the
    </p>
    <p>
     shadow of a peril so great, a slavery so imminent, that the most savage
    </p>
    <p>
     war of conquest ever waged would be a mere skirmish, by comparison!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Mechanically he labored on and on, turning the tremendous problem in his
    </p>
    <p>
     brain, striving in vain for some solution, some grasp at effective
    </p>
    <p>
     opposition. And, as he thought, a kind of dumb hopelessness settled down
    </p>
    <p>
     about him, tangible almost as a curtain black and heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What shall I do?" he muttered to himself. "What can I do, to strike
    </p>
    <p>
     these devils from their villainous plan of mastery?"
    </p>
    <p>
     As yet, he saw nothing clearly. No way seemed open to him. Alone, he
    </p>
    <p>
     knew he could do nothing; yet whither should he turn for help? To rival
    </p>
    <p>
     capitalist groups? They would not even listen to him; or, if they
    </p>
    <p>
     listened and believed, they would only combine with the plotters, or
    </p>
    <p>
     else, on their own hook, try to emulate them. To the labor movement? It
    </p>
    <p>
     would mock him as a chimerical dreamer, despite all his proofs. At best,
    </p>
    <p>
     he might start a few ineffectual strikes, petty and futile, indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     against this vast, on-moving power. To the Socialists? They, through
    </p>
    <p>
     their press and speakers--in case they should believe him and co-operate
    </p>
    <p>
     with him--could, indeed, give the matter vast publicity and excite
    </p>
    <p>
     popular opposition; but, after all, could they abort the plan? He feared
    </p>
    <p>
     they could not. The time, he knew, was not yet ripe when Labor, on the
    </p>
    <p>
     political field, could meet and overthrow forces such as these.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, for all his fevered thinking, he got no radical, no practical
    </p>
    <p>
     solution of the terrible problem. More and more definitely, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     weighed the pros and cons, the belief was borne in upon him that in this
    </p>
    <p>
     case he must appeal to nobody but himself, count on nobody, trust in
    </p>
    <p>
     nobody save Gabriel Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I must play a lone hand game, for a while at least," he concluded, as
    </p>
    <p>
     he finished his casting and took another. "Later, perhaps, I can enlist
    </p>
    <p>
     my comrades. But for now, I must watch, wait, work, all alone. Perhaps,
    </p>
    <p>
     armed with this knowledge--invaluable knowledge shared by no one--I can
    </p>
    <p>
     meet their moves, checkmate their plans and defeat their ends. Perhaps!
    </p>
    <p>
     It will be a battle between one man, obscure and without means, and two
    </p>
    <p>
     men who hold billions of dollars and unlimited resources in their grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     A battle unequal in every sense; a battle to the death. But I may win,
    </p>
    <p>
     after all. Every probability is that I shall lose, lose everything, even
    </p>
    <p>
     my life. Yet still, there is a chance. By God, I'll take it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The last words, uttered aloud, seemed to spring from his lips as though
    </p>
    <p>
     uttered by the very power of invincible determination. A sneer, behind
    </p>
    <p>
     him, brought him round with a start. His gaze widened, at sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog standing there, cold and dangerous looking, with a venomous
    </p>
    <p>
     expression in those ill-mated eyes of his.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take it, will you?" jibed the scientist. "You thief!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel sprang up so suddenly that his stool clattered over backward on
    </p>
    <p>
     the red-tiled floor. His big fist clenched and lifted. But Herzog never
    </p>
    <p>
     flinched.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thief!" he repeated, with an ugly thrust of the jaw. Servile and
    </p>
    <p>
     crawling to his masters, the man was ever arrogant and harsh with those
    </p>
    <p>
     beneath his authority. "I repeat the word. Drop that fist, Armstrong, if
    </p>
    <p>
     you know what's good for you. I warn you. Any disturbance, here,
    </p>
    <p>
     and--well, you know what we can do!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The electrician paled, slightly. But it was not through cowardice. Rage,
    </p>
    <p>
     passion unspeakable, a sudden and animal hate of this lick-spittle and
    </p>
    <p>
     supine toady shook him to the heart's core. Yet he managed to control
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, not through any personal apprehension, but because of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     work he knew still lay before him. At all hazards, come what might, he
    </p>
    <p>
     must stay on, there, at the Oakwood Heights plant. Nothing, now, must
    </p>
    <p>
     come between him and that one supreme labor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus he controlled himself, with an effort so tremendous that it
    </p>
    <p>
     wrenched his very soul. This trouble, whatever it might be, must not be
    </p>
    <p>
     noised about. Already, up and down the shop, workers were peering
    </p>
    <p>
     curiously at him. He must be calm; must pass the insult, smooth the
    </p>
    <p>
     situation and remain employed there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I--I beg pardon," he managed to articulate, with pale lips that
    </p>
    <p>
     trembled. He wiped the beaded sweat from his broad forehead. "Excuse me,
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Herzog. I--you startled me. What's the trouble? Any complaint to
    </p>
    <p>
     make? If so, I'm here to listen."
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog's teeth showed in a rat-like grin of malice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, you'll listen, all right enough," he sneered. "I've named you, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that goes! You're a thief, Armstrong, and this proves it! Look!"
    </p>
    <p>
     From behind his back, where he had been holding it, he produced the
    </p>
    <p>
     little morocco-covered book. Right in Armstrong's face he shook it, with
    </p>
    <p>
     an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Steal, will you?" he jibed. "For it's the same thing--no difference
    </p>
    <p>
     whether you picked it out of Mr. Flint's pocket or found it on the floor
    </p>
    <p>
     here, and tried to keep it! Steal, eh? Hold it for some possible reward?
    </p>
    <p>
     You skunk! Lucky you haven't brains enough to make out what's in it!
    </p>
    <p>
     Thought you'd keep it, did you? But you weren't smart enough,
    </p>
    <p>
     Armstrong--no, not quite smart enough for me! After looking the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     place over, I thought I'd have a go at a few pockets--and, you see? Oh,
    </p>
    <p>
     you'll have to get up early to beat _me_ at the game you--you thief!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With the last word, he raised the book and struck the young man a
    </p>
    <p>
     blistering welt across the face with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Armstrong fell back, against the bench, perfectly livid, with the wale
    </p>
    <p>
     of the blow standing out red and distinct across his cheek. Then he went
    </p>
    <p>
     pale as death, and staggered as though about to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God--God in heaven!" he gasped. "Give me--strength--not to kill this
    </p>
    <p>
     animal!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A startled look came into Herzog's face. He recognized, at last, the
    </p>
    <p>
     nature of the rage he had awakened. In those twitching fists and that
    </p>
    <p>
     white, writhen face he recognized the signs of passion that might, on a
    </p>
    <p>
     second's notice, leap to murder. And, shot through with panic, he now
    </p>
    <p>
     retreated, like the coward he was, though with the sneer still on his
    </p>
    <p>
     thin and cruel lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get your time!" he commanded, with crude brutality. "Go, get it at
    </p>
    <p>
     once. You're lucky to get off so easily. If Flint knew this, you'd land
    </p>
    <p>
     behind bars. But we want no scenes here. Get your money from Sanderson,
    </p>
    <p>
     and clear out. Your job ended the minute my hand touched that book in
    </p>
    <p>
     your pocket!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Still Armstrong made no reply. Still he remained there, dazed and
    </p>
    <p>
     stricken, pallid as milk, a wild and terrible light in his blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     An ugly murmur rose. Two or three of his fellow-workmen had come
    </p>
    <p>
     drifting down the shop, toward the scene of altercation. Another joined
    </p>
    <p>
     them, and another. Not one of them but hated Herzog with a bitter
    </p>
    <p>
     animosity. And now perhaps, the time was come to pay a score or two.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Armstrong, suddenly lifting his head, faced them all, his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
     His mind, quick-acting, had realized that, now his possession of the
    </p>
    <p>
     book had been discovered, his chances of discovering anything more, at
    </p>
    <p>
     the works, had utterly vanished. Even though he should remain, he could
    </p>
    <p>
     do nothing there. If he were to act, it must be from the outside, now,
    </p>
    <p>
     following the trend of events, dogging each development, striving in
    </p>
    <p>
     hidden, devious ways--violent ways, perhaps--to pull down this horrible
    </p>
    <p>
     edifice of enslavement ere it should whelm and crush the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, acting as quickly as he had thought, and now ignoring the man Herzog
    </p>
    <p>
     as though he had never existed, Armstrong faced his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's all right, boys," said he, quite slowly, his voice seeming to
    </p>
    <p>
     come from a distance, his tones forced and unnatural. "It's all right,
    </p>
    <p>
     every way. I'm caught with the goods. Don't any of you butt in. Don't
    </p>
    <p>
     mix with my trouble. For once I'm glad this is a scab shop, otherwise
    </p>
    <p>
     there might be a strike, here, and worse Hell to pay than there will be
    </p>
    <p>
     otherwise. I'm done. I'll get my time, and quit. But--remember one
    </p>
    <p>
     thing, you'll understand some day what this is all about.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm glad to have worked with you fellows, the past few months. You're
    </p>
    <p>
     all right, every one of you. Good-bye, and remember--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here, you men, get back to work!" cried Herzog, suddenly. "No
    </p>
    <p>
     hand-shaking here, and no speech-making. This man's a sneak-thief and
    </p>
    <p>
     he's fired, that's all there is to it. Now, get onto your job! The first
    </p>
    <p>
     man that puts up a complaint about it, can get through, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment they glowered at him, there in the white-lighted glare of
    </p>
    <p>
     the big shop. A fight, even then, was perilously near, but Armstrong
    </p>
    <p>
     averted it by turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm done." he repeated. He gathered up a few tools that belonged to
    </p>
    <p>
     him, personally, gave one look at his comrades, waved a hand at them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and then, followed by Herzog, strode off down the long aisle, toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Herzog," said he, calmly and with cold emphasis, "listen to this."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get out! Get your time, I tell you, and go!" repeated the bully. "To
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell with you! Clear out of here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm going," the young man answered. "But before I do, remember this;
    </p>
    <p>
     you grazed death, just now. Well for you, Herzog, almighty well for you,
    </p>
    <p>
     my temper didn't best me. For remember, you struck me and called me
    </p>
    <p>
     'thief'--and that sort of thing can't be forgotten, ever, even though
    </p>
    <p>
     we live a thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Remember, Herzog--not now, but sometime. Remember that one
    </p>
    <p>
     word--sometime! That's all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With no further speech, and while Herzog still stood there by the shop
    </p>
    <p>
     door, sneering at him, Armstrong turned and passed out. A few minutes
    </p>
    <p>
     later he had been paid off, had packed his knapsack with his few
    </p>
    <p>
     belongings, and was outside the big palisade, striding along the hard
    </p>
    <p>
     and glaring road toward the station.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did it," his one overmastering thought was. "Thank heaven, I did it!
    </p>
    <p>
     I held my temper and my tongue, didn't kill that spawn of Hell, and
    </p>
    <p>
     saved the whole situation. I'm out of a job, true enough, and out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     plant; but after all, I'm free--and I know what's in the wind!
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's yet hope. There'll be a way, a way to do this work! What a man
    </p>
    <p>
     _must_ do, he _can_ do!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Up came Armstrong's chin, as he walked. His shoulders squared, with
    </p>
    <p>
     strength and purpose, and his stride swung into the easy machine gait
    </p>
    <p>
     that had already carried him so many thousand miles along the hard and
    </p>
    <p>
     bitter highways of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he strode away, on the long road toward he knew not what, words
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to form and shape in his strengthened and refortified mind--words
    </p>
    <p>
     for long years forgotten--words that he once had heard at his mother's
    </p>
    <p>
     knee:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_He that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city!_"

    <p>
     A GLIMPSE AT THE PARASITES.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Longmeadow Country Club, on the Saturday afternoon following
    </p>
    <p>
     Armstrong's abrupt dismissal, was a scene of gaiety and beauty without
    </p>
    <p>
     compare. Set in broad acres of wood and lawn, the club-house proudly
    </p>
    <p>
     dominated far-flung golf-links and nearer tennis-courts. Shining motors
    </p>
    <p>
     stood parked on the plaza before the club garage, each valued at several
    </p>
    <p>
     years' wages of a workingman. Men and women--exploiters all, or
    </p>
    <p>
     parasites--elegantly and coolly clad in white, smote the swift sphere
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the tennis-court, with jest and laughter. Others, attended by
    </p>
    <p>
     caddies--mere proletarian scum, bent beneath the weight of cleeks and
    </p>
    <p>
     brassies--moved across the smooth-cropped links, kept in condition by
    </p>
    <p>
     grazing sheep and by steam-rollers. On putting-green and around bunkers
    </p>
    <p>
     these idlers struggled with artificial difficulties, while in shops and
    </p>
    <p>
     mines and factories, on railways and in the blazing Hells of
    </p>
    <p>
     stoke-holes, men of another class, a slave-class, labored and agonized,
    </p>
    <p>
     toiled and died that _these_ might wear fine linen and spend the long
    </p>
    <p>
     June afternoon in play.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the huge, cobble-stone chimney of the Country Club, upwafting smoke
    </p>
    <p>
     told of the viands now preparing for the idlers' dinner, after
    </p>
    <p>
     sport--rich meats and dainties of the rarest. In the rathskeller some of
    </p>
    <p>
     the elder and more indolent men were absorbing alcohol while music
    </p>
    <p>
     played and painted nymphs of abundant charms looked down from the
    </p>
    <p>
     wall-frescoes. Out on the broad piazzas, well sheltered by awnings from
    </p>
    <p>
     the rather ardent sun, men and women sat at spotless tables, dallying
    </p>
    <p>
     with drinks of rare hues and exalted prices. Cigarette-smoke wafted away
    </p>
    <p>
     on the pure breeze from over the Catskills, far to northwest, defiling
    </p>
    <p>
     the sweet breath of Nature, herself, with fumes of nicotine and dope. A
    </p>
    <p>
     Hungarian orchestra was playing the latest Manhattan ragtime, at the far
    </p>
    <p>
     end of the piazza. It was, all in all, a scene of rare refinement,
    </p>
    <p>
     characteristic to a degree of the efflorescence of American capitalism.
    </p>
    <p>
     At one of the tables, obviously bored, sat Catherine Flint, only
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter of the Billionaire. A rare girl, she, to look
    </p>
    <p>
     upon--deep-bosomed and erect, dressed simply in a middy-blouse with a
    </p>
    <p>
     blue tie, a khaki skirt and low, rubber-soled shoes revealing a
    </p>
    <p>
     silk-stockinged ankle that would have attracted the enthusiastic
    </p>
    <p>
     attention of gentlemen in any city of the world. No hat disfigured the
    </p>
    <p>
     coiled and braided masses of coppery hair that circled her shapely head.
    </p>
    <p>
     A healthy tan on face and arms and open throat bespoke her keen devotion
    </p>
    <p>
     to all outdoor life. Her fingers, lithe and strong, were graced by but
    </p>
    <p>
     two rings--a monogram, of gold, and the betrothal ring that Maxim
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron had put there, only three weeks before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Impatience dominated her. One could see that, in the nervous tapping of
    </p>
    <p>
     her fingers on the cloth; the slight swing of her right foot as she sat
    </p>
    <p>
     there, one knee crossed over the other; the glance of her keen, gray
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes down the broad drive-way that led from the huge stone gates up to
    </p>
    <p>
     the club-house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beside her sat a nonentity in impeccable dress, dangling a monocle and
    </p>
    <p>
     trying to make small-talk, the while he dallied with a Bronx cocktail,
    </p>
    <p>
     costing more than a day's wage for a childish flower-making slave of the
    </p>
    <p>
     tenements, and inhaled a Rotten Row cigarette, the "last word" from
    </p>
    <p>
     London in the tobacco line. To the sallies of this elegant, the girl
    </p>
    <p>
     replied by only monosyllables. Her glass was empty, nor would she have
    </p>
    <p>
     it filled, despite the exquisite's entreaties. From time to time she
    </p>
    <p>
     glanced impatiently at the long bag of golf-sticks leaning against the
    </p>
    <p>
     porch rail; and, now and then, her eyes sought the little Cervine watch
    </p>
    <p>
     set in a leather wristlet on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Inconsiderate of him, I'm sure--ah--to keep so magnificent a Diana
    </p>
    <p>
     waiting," drawled her companion, blowing a lungful of thin blue smoke
    </p>
    <p>
     athwart the breeze. "Especially when you're so deuced keen on doing the
    </p>
    <p>
     course before dinner. Now if _I_ were the favored swain, wild horses
    </p>
    <p>
     wouldn't keep me away."
    </p>
    <p>
     She made no answer, but turned a look of indifference on the shrimp
    </p>
    <p>
     beside her. Had he possessed the soul of a real man, he would have
    </p>
    <p>
     shriveled; but, being oblivious to all things save the pride of wealth
    </p>
    <p>
     and monstrous self-conceit, he merely snickered and reached for his
    </p>
    <p>
     cocktail--which, by the way, he was absorbing through a straw.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I say, Miss Flint?" he presently began again, stirring the ice in the
    </p>
    <p>
     cocktail.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well?" she answered, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you--er--are really very, _very_ impatient to have a go at the
    </p>
    <p>
     links, why wait for Wally? I--I should be only too glad to volunteer my
    </p>
    <p>
     services as your knight-errant, and all that sort of thing."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thanks, awfully," she answered, "but Mr. Waldron promised to go round
    </p>
    <p>
     the course with me, this afternoon, and I'll wait."
    </p>
    <p>
     The impeccable one grinned fatuously, invited her again to have a
    </p>
    <p>
     drink--which she declined--and ordered another for himself, with profuse
    </p>
    <p>
     apologies for drinking alone; apologies which she hardly seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Deuced bad form of Wally, I must say," the gilded youth resumed, trying
    </p>
    <p>
     to make capital for himself, "to leave you in the lurch, this way!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence from Catherine. The would-be interloper, feeling that he was on
    </p>
    <p>
     the wrong track, took counsel with himself and remained for a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     immersed in what he imagined to be thought. At last, however, with an
    </p>
    <p>
     oblique glance at his indifferent companion, he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Devilish hard time women have in this world, you know! Don't you
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes wish you were a man?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Her answer flashed back like a rapier:
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! Do you wish _you_ were?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Stunned by this "facer," Reginald Van Slyke gasped and stared. That he,
    </p>
    <p>
     a scion of the Philadelphia Van Slykes, in his own right worth two
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred million dollars--dollars ground out of the Kensington
    </p>
    <p>
     carpet-mill slaves by his grandfather--should be thus flouted and put
    </p>
    <p>
     upon by the daughter of Flint, that parvenu, absolutely floored him. For
    </p>
    <p>
     a moment he sat there speechless, unable even to reach for his drink;
    </p>
    <p>
     but presently some coherence returned. He was about to utter what he
    </p>
    <p>
     conceived to be a strong rejoinder, when the girl suddenly standing up,
    </p>
    <p>
     turned her back upon him and ignored him as completely as she might have
    </p>
    <p>
     ignored any of the menials of the club.
    </p>
    <p>
     His irritated glance followed hers. There, far down the drive, just
    </p>
    <p>
     rounding the long turn by the artificial lake, a big blue motor car was
    </p>
    <p>
     speeding up the grade at a good clip. Van Slyke recognized it, and swore
    </p>
    <p>
     below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wally, at last, damn him!" he muttered. "Just when I was beginning to
    </p>
    <p>
     make headway with Kate!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Vexed beyond endurance, he drummed on the cloth with angry fingers; but
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine was oblivious. Unmindful of the merry-makers at the other
    </p>
    <p>
     tables, the girl waved her handkerchief at the swiftly-approaching
    </p>
    <p>
     motor. Waldron, from the back seat, raised an answering hand--though
    </p>
    <p>
     without enthusiasm. Above all things he hated demonstration, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     girl's frank manner, free, unconventional and not yet broken to the
    </p>
    <p>
     harness of Mrs. Grundy, never failed to irritate him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very incorrect for people in our set," he often thought. "But for the
    </p>
    <p>
     present I can do nothing. Once she is my wife, ah, then I shall find
    </p>
    <p>
     means to curb her. For the present, however, I must let her have her
    </p>
    <p>
     head."
    </p>
    <p>
     Such was now his frame of mind as the long car slid under the
    </p>
    <p>
     porte-cochÃ¨re and came to a stand. He would have infinitely preferred
    </p>
    <p>
     that the girl should wait his coming to her, on the piazza; but already
    </p>
    <p>
     she had slung her bag of sticks over her strong shoulder, and was down
    </p>
    <p>
     the steps to meet him. Her leave-taking of the incensed Van Slyke had
    </p>
    <p>
     been the merest nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're late, Wally," said she, smiling with her usual good humor, which
    </p>
    <p>
     had already quite dissipated her impatience. "Late, but I'll forgive
    </p>
    <p>
     you, this time. I'm afraid we won't have time to do all eighteen holes
    </p>
    <p>
     round. What kept you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Business, business!" he answered, frowning. "Always the same old
    </p>
    <p>
     grind, Kate. You women don't understand. I tell you, this slaving in
    </p>
    <p>
     Wall Street isn't what it's cracked up to be. I couldn't get away till
    </p>
    <p>
     11:30. Then, just had a quick bite of lunch, and broke every speed law
    </p>
    <p>
     in New York getting here. Do you forgive me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He had descended from the car, in speaking. They shook hands, while the
    </p>
    <p>
     chauffeur stood at attention and all the gossips on the piazza, scenting
    </p>
    <p>
     the possibility of a disagreement, craned discreetly eager necks and
    </p>
    <p>
     listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Forgive you? Of course--this time, but never again," the girl laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, run along and get into your flannels. I'll meet you on the driving
    </p>
    <p>
     green, in ten minutes. Not another second, mind, or--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll be on the dot," he answered. "Here, boy," beckoning a caddy, "take
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Flint's sticks. And have mine carried to the green. Look sharp,
    </p>
    <p>
     now!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, with a nod at the girl, he ran up the steps and vanished in the
    </p>
    <p>
     club-house, bound for the locker-room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fifteen minutes the girl waited on the green, watching others drive off
    </p>
    <p>
     from the little tees and inwardly chafing to be in action. Fifteen, and
    </p>
    <p>
     then twenty, before Waldron finally appeared, immaculate in white,
    </p>
    <p>
     bare-armed and with a loose, checked cap shading his close-set eyes. The
    </p>
    <p>
     fact was, in addition to having changed his clothes, he had felt obliged
    </p>
    <p>
     to linger in the bar for a little Scotch; and one drink had meant
    </p>
    <p>
     another; and thus precious moments had sped.
    </p>
    <p>
     But his smile was confident as he approached the green. Women, after
    </p>
    <p>
     all, he reflected, were meant to be kept waiting. They never appreciated
    </p>
    <p>
     a man who kept appointments exactly. Not less fatuous at heart, in
    </p>
    <p>
     truth, was he, than the unfortunate Van Slyke. But his manner was
    </p>
    <p>
     perfection as he saluted her and bade the caddy build their tees.
    </p>
    <p>
     The girl, however, was now plainly vexed. Her mouth had drawn a trifle
    </p>
    <p>
     tight and the tilt of her chin was determined. Her eyes were far from
    </p>
    <p>
     soft, as she surveyed this delinquent fiancÃ©.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't like you a bit, today, Wally," said she, as he deliberated
    </p>
    <p>
     over the club-bag, choosing a driver. "This makes twice you've kept me
    </p>
    <p>
     waiting. I warn you don't let it happen again!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the seeming banter of her tone lurked real resentment. But he,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a smile--partly due to a finger too much Scotch--only answered, in
    </p>
    <p>
     a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're adorable, today, Kate! The combination of fresh air and
    </p>
    <p>
     annoyance has painted the most wonderful roses on your cheeks!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She shrugged her shoulders with a little motion she had inherited from
    </p>
    <p>
     French ancestry, stooped, set her golf ball on the little mound of sand,
    </p>
    <p>
     exactly to suit her, and raised her driver on high.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nine holes," said she, "and I'm going to beat you, today!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He frowned a little at the spirit of the threat, for any self-assertion
    </p>
    <p>
     in a woman crossed his grain; but soon forgot his pique in admiration of
    </p>
    <p>
     the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Swishing, her club flashed down in a quick circle. _Crack_! It struck
    </p>
    <p>
     the gutta-percha squarely. The little white sphere zipped away like a
    </p>
    <p>
     rocket, rose in a far trajectory, up, up, toward the water-hazard at the
    </p>
    <p>
     foot of the grassy slope, then down in a long curve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even while the girl's cry of "Fore!" was echoing across the green, the
    </p>
    <p>
     ball struck earth, ricochetted and sped on, away, across the turf, till
    </p>
    <p>
     it came to rest not twenty yards from the putting green of the first
    </p>
    <p>
     hole.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wheeoo!" whistled Waldron. "Some drive. I guess you're going to make
    </p>
    <p>
     good your threat, today, Kate of my heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The smile she flashed at him showed that her resentment had, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     moment, been forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come on, Wally, now let's see what _you_ can do," said she, starting
    </p>
    <p>
     off down the slope, while her meek caddy tagged at a respectful
    </p>
    <p>
     distance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, thus adjured, teed up and swung at the ball. But the Scotch had
    </p>
    <p>
     by no means steadied his aim. He foozled badly and broke his pet driver,
    </p>
    <p>
     into the bargain. The steel head of it flew farther even than the ball,
    </p>
    <p>
     which moved hardly ten yards.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn!" he muttered, under his breath, choosing another stick and
    </p>
    <p>
     glancing with real irritation at Catherine's lithe, splendidly poised
    </p>
    <p>
     figure already some distance down the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
     His second stroke was more successful, nearly equalling hers. But her
    </p>
    <p>
     advantage, thus early won, was not destined to be lost again. And as the
    </p>
    <p>
     game proceeded, Waldron's temper grew steadily worse and worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus began, for these two people, an hour destined to be fraught with
    </p>
    <p>
     such pregnant developments--an hour which, in its own way, vitally bore
    </p>
    <p>
     on the great loom now weaving warp and woof of world events.

     CHAPTER XI.

    <p>
     THE END OF TWO GAMES.
    </p>
    <p>
     Trivial events sometimes precipitate catastrophies. It has been said
    </p>
    <p>
     that had James MacDonald not left the farm gate open, at Hugomont,
    </p>
    <p>
     Waterloo might have ended otherwise. So now, the rupture between
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine Flint and Maxim Waldron was precipitated by a single unguarded
    </p>
    <p>
     oath.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was at the ninth hole, down back of the Terrace Woods bunker.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, heated by exercise and the whiskey he had drunk, had already
    </p>
    <p>
     dismissed the caddies and had undertaken to carry the clubs, himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     hoping--man-fashion--to steal a kiss or two from Catherine, along the
    </p>
    <p>
     edge of the close-growing oaks and maples. But all his plans went agley,
    </p>
    <p>
     for Catherine really made good and beat him, there, by half a dozen
    </p>
    <p>
     strokes; and as her little sphere, deftly driven by the putting-iron
    </p>
    <p>
     gripped in her brown, firm hands, rolled precisely over the cropped turf
    </p>
    <p>
     and fell into the tinned hole, the man ejaculated a perfectly audible
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Hell!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     She stood erect and faced him, with a singular expression in those level
    </p>
    <p>
     gray eyes--eyes the look of which could allure or wither, could entice
    </p>
    <p>
     or command.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wally," said she, "did you swear?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I--er--why, yes," he stammered, taken aback and realizing, despite his
    </p>
    <p>
     chagrin, how very poor and unsportsmanlike a figure he was cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't like it," she returned. "Not a little bit, Wally. It isn't
    </p>
    <p>
     game, and it isn't manly. You must respect me, now and always. I can't
    </p>
    <p>
     have profanity, and I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
     He essayed lame apologies, but a sudden, hot anger seemed to have
    </p>
    <p>
     possessed him, in presence of this free, independent, exacting
    </p>
    <p>
     woman--this woman who, worst of all, had just beaten him at the game of
    </p>
    <p>
     all games he prided himself on playing well. And despite his every
    </p>
    <p>
     effort, she saw through the veil of sheer, perfunctory courtesy; and
    </p>
    <p>
     seeing, flushed with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wally," she said in a low, quiet tone, fixing a singular gaze upon him,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wally, I don't know what to make of you lately. The other night at Idle
    </p>
    <p>
     Hour, you hardly looked at me. You and father spent the whole evening
    </p>
    <p>
     discussing some business or other--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Most important business, my dear girl, I do assure you," protested
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, trying to steady his voice. "Most vitally--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No matter about that," she interposed. "It could have been abridged, a
    </p>
    <p>
     trifle. I barely got six words out of you, that evening; and let me tell
    </p>
    <p>
     you, Wally, a woman never forgets neglect. She may forgive it; but
    </p>
    <p>
     forget it, never!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, well, if you put it that way--" he began, but checked himself in
    </p>
    <p>
     time to suppress the cutting rejoinder he had at his tongue's end.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do, and it's vital, Wally," she answered. "It's all part and parcel
    </p>
    <p>
     of some singular kind of change that's been coming over you, lately,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a blight. You haven't been yourself, at all, these few days past.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something or other, I don't know what, has been coming between us.
    </p>
    <p>
     You've got something else on your mind, beside me--something bigger and
    </p>
    <p>
     more important to you than I am--and--and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     He pulled out his gold cigar-case, chose and lighted a cigar to steady
    </p>
    <p>
     his nerve, and faced her with a smile--the worst tactic he could
    </p>
    <p>
     possibly have chosen in dealing with this woman. Supremely successful in
    </p>
    <p>
     handling men, he lacked finesse and insight with the other sex; and now
    </p>
    <p>
     that lack, in his moment of need, was bringing him moment by moment
    </p>
    <p>
     nearer the edge of catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't like it at all, Waldron," she resumed, again. "You were late,
    </p>
    <p>
     the other night, in taking me to the Flower Show. You were late, today,
    </p>
    <p>
     for our appointment here; and the ten minutes I gave you to get ready
    </p>
    <p>
     in, stretched out to twenty before you--"
    </p>
    <p>
     He interrupted her with a gesture of uncontrollable vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Really, my dear Kate," he exclaimed, "if you--er--insist on holding me
    </p>
    <p>
     to account for every moment--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You've been drinking, too, a little," she kept on. "And you know I
    </p>
    <p>
     detest it! And just now, when I beat you in a square game, you so far
    </p>
    <p>
     forgot yourself as to swear. Now, Waldron--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, puritanical, eh?" he sneered, ignoring the danger signals in her
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes. Even yet there might have been some chance of avoiding shipwreck,
    </p>
    <p>
     had he heeded those twin beacons, humbled himself, made amends by due
    </p>
    <p>
     apology and promised reformation. For though Catherine never had truly
    </p>
    <p>
     loved this man, some years older than herself and of radically different
    </p>
    <p>
     character, still she liked and respected him, and found him--by his very
    </p>
    <p>
     force and dominance--far more to her taste than the insipid hangers-on,
    </p>
    <p>
     sons of fortune or fortune-hunters, who, like the sap-brained Van
    </p>
    <p>
     Slyke, made up so great a part of her "set."
    </p>
    <p>
     So, all might yet have been amended; but this was not to be. Never yet
    </p>
    <p>
     had "Tiger" Waldron bowed the neck to living man or woman. Dominance was
    </p>
    <p>
     his whole scheme of life. Though he might purr, politely enough, so long
    </p>
    <p>
     as his fur was smoothed the right way, a single backward stroke set his
    </p>
    <p>
     fangs gleaming and unsheathed every sabre-like claw. And now this woman,
    </p>
    <p>
     his fiancÃ©e though she was, her beauty dear to him and her charm most
    </p>
    <p>
     fascinating, her fortune much desired and most of all, an alliance with
    </p>
    <p>
     her father--now this woman, despite all these considerations, had with a
    </p>
    <p>
     few incisive words ruffled his temper beyond endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     So great was his agitation that, despite his strongest instinct of
    </p>
    <p>
     saving, he flung away the scarcely-tasted cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Kate," he exclaimed, his very tongue thick with the rage he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     quell, "Kate, I can't stand this! You're going too far. What do you know
    </p>
    <p>
     of men's work and men's affairs? Who are you, to judge of their times of
    </p>
    <p>
     coming and going, their obligations, their habits and man of life? What
    </p>
    <p>
     do _you_ understand--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's obvious," she replied with glacial coldness, "that I don't
    </p>
    <p>
     understand _you_, and never have. I have been living in a dream, Wally;
    </p>
    <p>
     seeing you through the glass of illusion; not reality. After all, you're
    </p>
    <p>
     like all men--just the same, no different. Idealism, self-sacrifice, con
    </p>
    <p>
     true nobility of character, where are these, in you? What is there but
    </p>
    <p>
     the same old selfishness, the same innate masculine conceit and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No more of this, Kate!" cried the financier, paling a little. "No more!
    </p>
    <p>
     I can't have it! I won't--it's impossible! You--you don't understand, I
    </p>
    <p>
     tell you. In your narrow, untrained, woman's way, you try to set up
    </p>
    <p>
     standards for me; try to judge me, and dictate to me. Some old
    </p>
    <p>
     puritanical streak in you is cropping out, some blue-law atavism, some I
    </p>
    <p>
     know not what, that rebels against my taking a drink--like every other
    </p>
    <p>
     man. That cries out against my letting slip a harmless oath--again, like
    </p>
    <p>
     every other man that lives and breathes. Every man, that is, who _is_ a
    </p>
    <p>
     man, a real man, not a dummy! If you've been mistaken in me, how much
    </p>
    <p>
     more have I, in you! And so--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And so," she took the very words from his pale lips, "we've both been
    </p>
    <p>
     mistaken, that's all. No, no," she forbade him with raised hand, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     would have interrupted with protests. "No, you needn't try to convince
    </p>
    <p>
     me otherwise, now. A thousand volumes of speeches, after this, couldn't
    </p>
    <p>
     do it. An hour's insight into the true depths of a man's character--yes,
    </p>
    <p>
     even a moment's--perfectly suffices to show the truth. You've just drawn
    </p>
    <p>
     the veil aside, Wally, for me, and let me look at the true picture. All
    </p>
    <p>
     that I've known and thought of you, so far, has been sham and illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, I _know_ you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You--you don't, Catherine!" he exclaimed, half in anger, half
    </p>
    <p>
     contrition, terrified at last by the imminent break between them, by the
    </p>
    <p>
     thought of losing this rich flower from the garden of womanhood, this
    </p>
    <p>
     splendid financial and social prize. "I--I've done wrong, Kate. I admit
    </p>
    <p>
     it. But, truly--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No more," said she, and in her voice sounded a command he knew, at
    </p>
    <p>
     last, was quite inexorable. "I'm not like other women of our set,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps. I can't be bought and sold, Wally, with money and position. I
    </p>
    <p>
     can't marry a man, and have to live with him, if he shows himself
    </p>
    <p>
     petty, or small, or narrow in any way. I must be free, free as air, as
    </p>
    <p>
     long as I live. Even in marriage, I must be free. Freedom can only come
    </p>
    <p>
     with the union of two souls that understand and help and inspire each
    </p>
    <p>
     other. Anything else is slavery--and worse!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She shuddered, and for a moment turned half away from him, as, now
    </p>
    <p>
     contrite enough for the minute, he stood there looking at her with dazed
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes. For a second the idea came to him that he must take her in his
    </p>
    <p>
     arms, there in the edge of the woods, burn kisses on her ripe mouth, win
    </p>
    <p>
     her back to him by force, as he had won all life's battles. He would
    </p>
    <p>
     not, could not, let this prize escape him now. A wave of desire surged
    </p>
    <p>
     through his being. He took a step toward her, his trembling arms open to
    </p>
    <p>
     seize her lithe, seductive body. But she, retreating, held him away with
    </p>
    <p>
     repellant palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no, no!" she cried. "Not now--never that, any more! I must be free,
    </p>
    <p>
     Wally--free as air!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She raised her face toward the vast reaches of the sky, breathed deep
    </p>
    <p>
     and for a moment closed her eyes, as though bathing her very soul in the
    </p>
    <p>
     sweet freedom of the out-of-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Free as air!" she whispered. "Let me go!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He started violently. Her simile had struck him like a lash.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Free--as what?" he exclaimed hoarsely. "As _air_? But--but there's no
    </p>
    <p>
     such freedom, I tell you! Air isn't free any more--or won't be, soon! It
    </p>
    <p>
     will be everything, anything but free, before another year is gone! Free
    </p>
    <p>
     as air? You--you don't understand! Your father and I--we shall soon own
    </p>
    <p>
     the air. Free as air? Yes, if you like! For that--that means you, too,
    </p>
    <p>
     must belong to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Again he sought to take her, to hold her and overmaster her. But she,
    </p>
    <p>
     now wide-eyed with a kind of sudden terror at this latest outbreak, this
    </p>
    <p>
     seeming madness on his part, which she could nowise fathom or
    </p>
    <p>
     comprehend, retreated ever more and more, away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then suddenly with a quick effort, she stripped off the splendid,
    </p>
    <p>
     blazing diamond from her finger, and held it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wally," said she, calm now and quite herself again, "Wally, let's be
    </p>
    <p>
     friends. Just that and nothing more. Dear, good, companionable friends,
    </p>
    <p>
     as we used to be, long years ago, before this madness seized us--this
    </p>
    <p>
     chimera of--of love!"
    </p>
    <p>
     As a bull charging, is struck to the heart by the sword of the matador,
    </p>
    <p>
     and stops in his tracks, motionless and dazed before he falls, so
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tiger" Waldron stopped, wholly stunned by this abrupt and crushing
    </p>
    <p>
     denouement.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, man and woman faced each other. Not a word was spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine had no word to say; and Waldron, though his lips worked, could
    </p>
    <p>
     bring none to utterance. Then their eyes met; and his lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good-bye," said she quietly. "Good-bye forever, as my betrothed. When
    </p>
    <p>
     we meet again, Wally, it will be as friends, and nothing more. And now,
    </p>
    <p>
     let me go. Don't come with me. I prefer to be alone. I'd rather walk, a
    </p>
    <p>
     bit, and think--and then go back quietly to the club-house, and so home,
    </p>
    <p>
     in my car. Don't follow me. Here--take this, and--good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
     Mechanically he accepted the gleaming jewel. Mechanically, like a man
    </p>
    <p>
     without sense or reason, he watched her walk away from him, upright and
    </p>
    <p>
     strong and lithe, voluptuous and desirable in every motion of that
    </p>
    <p>
     splendid body, now lost to him forever. Then all at once, entering a
    </p>
    <p>
     woodland path that led by a short cut back to the club-house, she
    </p>
    <p>
     vanished from his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vanished, without having even so much as turned to look at him again, or
    </p>
    <p>
     wave that firm brown hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, seeming to waken from his daze, "Tiger" laughed, a terrible and
    </p>
    <p>
     cruel laugh; and then he flung a frightful blasphemy upon the still June
    </p>
    <p>
     air; and then he dashed the wondrous diamond to earth, and stamped and
    </p>
    <p>
     dug it with a perfect frenzy of rage into the soft mold.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, last of all, with lowered head and lips that moved in fearful
    </p>
    <p>
     curses, he crashed away into the woods, away from the path where the
    </p>
    <p>
     girl was, away from the club-house, away, away, thirsting for solitude
    </p>
    <p>
     and time to quell his passion, salve his wounded pride and ponder
    </p>
    <p>
     measures of terrible revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     The diamond ring, crushed into the earth, and the golf clubs, lying
    </p>
    <p>
     where they had fallen from the disputants' hands, now remained there as
    </p>
    <p>
     melancholy reminders of the double game--love and golf--which had so
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly ended in disaster.

     CHAPTER XII.

    <p>
     ON THE GREAT HIGHWAY.
    </p>
    <p>
     As violently rent from his job as Maxim Waldron had been torn from his
    </p>
    <p>
     alliance with Catherine, Gabriel Armstrong met the sudden change in his
    </p>
    <p>
     affairs with far more equanimity than the financier could muster. Once
    </p>
    <p>
     the young electrician's first anger had subsided--and he had pretty well
    </p>
    <p>
     mastered it before he had reached the Oakwood Heights station--he began
    </p>
    <p>
     philosophically to turn the situation in his mind, and to rough out his
    </p>
    <p>
     plans for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Things might be worse, all round," he reflected, as he strode along at
    </p>
    <p>
     a smart pace. "During the seven months I've been working for these
    </p>
    <p>
     pirates, I've managed to pay off the debt I got into at the time of the
    </p>
    <p>
     big E.&amp;nbsp;W. strike, and I've got eighteen dollars or a little more in
    </p>
    <p>
     my pocket. My clothes will do a while longer. Even though Flint
    </p>
    <p>
     blacklists me all over the country, as he probably will, I can duck into
    </p>
    <p>
     some job or other, somewhere. And most important of all, I know what's
    </p>
    <p>
     due to happen in America--I've seen that note-book! Let them do what
    </p>
    <p>
     they will, they can't take _that_ knowledge away from me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The outlook, on the whole, was cheering. Gabriel broke into a whistle,
    </p>
    <p>
     as he swung along the highway, and slashed cheerfully with his heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     stick at the dusty bushes by the roadside. A vigorous, pleasing figure
    </p>
    <p>
     of a man he made, striding onward in his blue flannel shirt and
    </p>
    <p>
     corduroys, stout boots making light of distance, somewhat rebellious
    </p>
    <p>
     black hair clustering under his cap, blue eyes clear and steady as the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunlight itself. There must have been a drop of Irish blood somewhere or
    </p>
    <p>
     other in his veins, to have given him that ruddy cheek, those eyes, that
    </p>
    <p>
     hair, that quick enthusiasm and that swiftness to anger--then, by
    </p>
    <p>
     reaction, that quick buoyancy which so soon banished everything but
    </p>
    <p>
     courageous optimism from his hot heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus the man walked, all his few worldly belongings--most precious among
    </p>
    <p>
     them his union card and his red Socialist card--packed in the knapsack
    </p>
    <p>
     strapped to his broad shoulders. And as he walked, he formulated his
    </p>
    <p>
     plans.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Niagara for mine," he decided. "It's there these hellions mean to start
    </p>
    <p>
     their devilish work of enslaving the whole world. It's there I want to
    </p>
    <p>
     be, and must be, to follow the infernal job from the beginning and to
    </p>
    <p>
     nail it, when the right time comes. I'll put in a day or two with my old
    </p>
    <p>
     friend, Sam Underwood, up in the Bronx, and maybe tell him what's doing
    </p>
    <p>
     and frame out the line of action with him. But after that, I strike for
    </p>
    <p>
     Niagara--yes, and on foot!"
    </p>
    <p>
     This decision came to him as strongly desirable. Not for some time, he
    </p>
    <p>
     knew, could the actual work of building the Air Trust plant be started
    </p>
    <p>
     at Niagara. Meanwhile, he wanted to keep out of sight, as much as
    </p>
    <p>
     possible. He wanted, also to save every cent. Again, his usual mode of
    </p>
    <p>
     travel had always been either to ride the rods or "hike" it on shanks'
    </p>
    <p>
     mare. Bitterly opposed to swelling the railways' revenues by even a
    </p>
    <p>
     penny, Armstrong in the past few years of his life had done some
    </p>
    <p>
     thousands of miles, afoot, all over the country. His best means of
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialist propaganda, he had found, was in just such meanderings along
    </p>
    <p>
     the highways and hedges of existence--a casual job, here or there, for a
    </p>
    <p>
     day, a week, a month--then, quick friendships; a little talk; a few
    </p>
    <p>
     leaflets handed to the intelligent, if he could find any. He had laced
    </p>
    <p>
     the continent with such peregrinations, always sowing the seed of
    </p>
    <p>
     revolution wherever he had passed; getting in touch with the Movement
    </p>
    <p>
     all over the republic; keeping his finger on the pulse of ever-growing,
    </p>
    <p>
     always-strengthening Socialism.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such had his habits long been. And now, once more adrift and jobless,
    </p>
    <p>
     but with the most tremendous secret of the ages in his possession, he
    </p>
    <p>
     naturally turned to the comfort and the calming influence of the broad
    </p>
    <p>
     highway, in his long journey towards the place where he was to meet, in
    </p>
    <p>
     desperate opposition, the machinations of the Air Trust magnates.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's the only way for me," he decided, as he turned into the road
    </p>
    <p>
     leading toward Saint George and the Manhattan Ferry. "Flint and Herzog
    </p>
    <p>
     will be sure to put Slade and the Cosmos people after me. Blacklisting
    </p>
    <p>
     will be the least of what they'll try to do. They'll use slugging
    </p>
    <p>
     tactics, sure, if they get a chance, or railroad me to some Pen or
    </p>
    <p>
     other, if possible. My one best bet is to keep out of their way; and I
    </p>
    <p>
     figure I'm ten times safer on the open road, with a few dollars to stave
    </p>
    <p>
     off a vagrancy charge, and with two good fists and this stick to keep
    </p>
    <p>
     'em at a distance, than I would be on the railroads or in cheap dumps
    </p>
    <p>
     along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The last place they'll ever think of looking for me will be the big
    </p>
    <p>
     outdoors. _Their_ idea of hunting for a workman is to dragnet the back
    </p>
    <p>
     rooms of saloons--especially if they're after a Socialist. That's the
    </p>
    <p>
     limit of their intelligence, to connect Socialism and beer. I'll beat
    </p>
    <p>
     'em; I'll hike--and it's a hundred to one I land in Niagara with more
    </p>
    <p>
     cash than when I started, with better health, more knowledge, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     freedom that, alone, can save the world now from the most damnable
    </p>
    <p>
     slavery that ever threatened its existence!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus reasoning, with perfect clarity and a long-headedness that proved
    </p>
    <p>
     him a strategist at four-and-twenty, Gabriel Armstrong whistled a louder
    </p>
    <p>
     note as he tramped away to northward, away from the hateful presence of
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog, away from the wage-slavery of the Oakwood Heights plant,
    </p>
    <p>
     away--with that precious secret in his brain--toward the far scene of
    </p>
    <p>
     destined warfare, where stranger things were to ensue than even he could
    </p>
    <p>
     possibly conceive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Saturday morning found him, his visit with Underwood at an end, already
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty miles or more from the Bronx River, marching along through
    </p>
    <p>
     Haverstraw, up the magnificent road that fringes the Hudson--now hidden
    </p>
    <p>
     from the mighty river behind a forest-screen, now curving on bold
    </p>
    <p>
     abutments right above the sun-kissed expanses of Haverstraw Bay, here
    </p>
    <p>
     more than two miles from wooded shore to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
     At eleven, he halted at a farm house, some miles north of the town, got
    </p>
    <p>
     a job on the woodpile, and astonished the farmer by the amount of birch
    </p>
    <p>
     he could saw in an hour. He took his pay in the shape of a bountiful
    </p>
    <p>
     dinner, and--after half an hour's smoke and talk with the farmer, to
    </p>
    <p>
     whom he gave a few pamphlets from the store in his knapsack--said
    </p>
    <p>
     good-bye to all hands and once more set his face northward for the long
    </p>
    <p>
     hike through much wilder country, to West Point, where he hoped to pass
    </p>
    <p>
     the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus we must leave him, for a while. For now the thread of our
    </p>
    <p>
     narration, like the silken cord in the Labyrinth of Crete, leads us back
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Country Club at Longmeadow, the scene, that very afternoon, of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sudden and violent rupture between the financier and Catherine
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine, her first indignation somewhat abated, and now vastly
    </p>
    <p>
     relieved at the realization that she indeed was free from her loveless
    </p>
    <p>
     and long-since irksome alliance with Waldron, calmly enough returned to
    </p>
    <p>
     the club-house. Head well up, and eyes defiant, she walked up the broad
    </p>
    <p>
     steps and into the office. Little cared she whether the piazza
    </p>
    <p>
     gossips--The Hammer and Anvil Club, in local slang--divined the quarrel
    </p>
    <p>
     or not. The girl felt herself immeasurably indifferent to such
    </p>
    <p>
     pettinesses as prying small talk and innuendo. Let people know, or not,
    </p>
    <p>
     as might be, she cared not a whit. Her business was her own. No wagging
    </p>
    <p>
     of tongues could one hair's breadth disturb that splendid calm of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The clerk, behind the desk, smiled and nodded at her approach.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please have my car brought round to the porte-cochÃ¨re, at once?" she
    </p>
    <p>
     asked. "And tell Herrick to be sure there's plenty of gas for a long
    </p>
    <p>
     run. I'm going through to New York."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So soon?" queried the clerk. "I'm sure your father will be
    </p>
    <p>
     disappointed, Miss Flint. He's just wired that he's coming out tomorrow,
    </p>
    <p>
     to spend Sunday here. He particularly asks to have you remain. See
    </p>
    <p>
     here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He handed her a telegram. She glanced it over, then crumpled it and
    </p>
    <p>
     tossed it into the office fire-place.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm sorry," she answered. "But I can't stay. I must get back, to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll telegraph father not to come. A blank, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The clerk handed her one. She pondered a second, then wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
     Dear Father: A change of plans makes me return home at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     Please wait and see me there. I've something important to talk over
    </p>
    <p>
     with you.
    </p>
    <p>
     Affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
     Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ordinarily people try to squeeze their message to ten words, and count
    </p>
    <p>
     and prune and count again; but not so, Catherine. For her, a telegram
    </p>
    <p>
     had never contained any space limit. It meant less to her than a
    </p>
    <p>
     post-card to you or me. Not that the girl was consciously extravagant.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, had you asked her, she would have claimed rigid economy--she rarely,
    </p>
    <p>
     for instance, paid more than a hundred dollars for a morning gown, or
    </p>
    <p>
     more than a thousand for a ball-dress. It was simply that the idea of
    </p>
    <p>
     counting words had never yet occurred to her. And so now, she
    </p>
    <p>
     complacently handed this verbose message to the clerk, who--thoroughly
    </p>
    <p>
     well-trained--understood it was to be charged on her father's perfectly
    </p>
    <p>
     staggering monthly bill.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well, Miss Flint," said he. "I'll send this at once. And your car
    </p>
    <p>
     will be ready for you in ten minutes--or five, if you like?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ten will do, thank you," she answered. Then she crossed to the
    </p>
    <p>
     elevator and went up to her own suite of rooms on the second floor, for
    </p>
    <p>
     her motor-coat and veils.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Free, thank heaven!" she breathed, with infinite relief, as she stood
    </p>
    <p>
     before the tall mirror, adjusting these for the long trip. "Free from
    </p>
    <p>
     that man forever. What a narrow escape! If things hadn't happened just
    </p>
    <p>
     as they did, and if I hadn't had that precious insight into Wally's
    </p>
    <p>
     character--good Lord!--catastrophe! Oh, I haven't been so happy since
    </p>
    <p>
     I--since--why, I've _never_ been so happy in all my life!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wally, dear boy," she added, turning toward the window as though
    </p>
    <p>
     apostrophizing him in reality, "now we can be good friends. Now all the
    </p>
    <p>
     sham and pretense are at an end, forever. As a friend, you may be
    </p>
    <p>
     splendid. As a husband--oh, impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Lighter of heart than she had been for years, was she, with the added
    </p>
    <p>
     zest of the long spin through the beauty of the June country before
    </p>
    <p>
     her--down among the hills and cliffs, among the forests and broad
    </p>
    <p>
     valleys--down to New York again, back to the father and the home she
    </p>
    <p>
     loved better than all else in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this happy frame of mind she presently entered the low-hung,
    </p>
    <p>
     swift-motored car, settled herself on the luxurious cushions and said
    </p>
    <p>
     "Home, at once!" to Herrick.
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded, but did not speak. He felt, in truth, somewhat incapable of
    </p>
    <p>
     quite incoherent speech. Not having expected any service till next day,
    </p>
    <p>
     he had foregathered with others of his ilk in the servants' bar,
    </p>
    <p>
     below-stairs, and had with wassail and good cheer very effectively put
    </p>
    <p>
     himself out of commission.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, somewhat sobered by this quick summons, he had managed to pull
    </p>
    <p>
     together. Now, drunk though he was, he sat there at the wheel, steady
    </p>
    <p>
     enough--so long as he held on to it--and only by the redness of his face
    </p>
    <p>
     and a certain glassy look in his eye, betrayed the fact of his
    </p>
    <p>
     intoxication. The girl, busy with her farewells as the car drew up for
    </p>
    <p>
     her, had not observed him. At the last moment Van Slyke waved a foppish
    </p>
    <p>
     hand at her, and smirked adieux. She acknowledged his good-bye with a
    </p>
    <p>
     smile, so happy was she at the outcome of her golf-game; then cast a
    </p>
    <p>
     quick glance up at the club windows, fearing to see the harsh face of
    </p>
    <p>
     Wally peeping down at her in anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he was nowhere to be seen; and now, with a sudden acceleration of
    </p>
    <p>
     the powerful six-cylinder engine, the big gray car moved smoothly
    </p>
    <p>
     forward. Growling in its might, it swung in a wide circle round the
    </p>
    <p>
     sweep of the drive, gathered speed and shot away down the grade toward
    </p>
    <p>
     the stone gates of the entrance, a quarter mile distant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently it swerved through these, to southward. Club-house, waving
    </p>
    <p>
     handkerchiefs and all vanished from Kate's view.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Faster, Herrick," she commanded, leaning forward, "I must be home by
    </p>
    <p>
     half past five."
    </p>
    <p>
     Again he nodded, and notched spark and throttle down. The car, leaping
    </p>
    <p>
     like a wild creature, began to hum at a swift clip along the smooth,
    </p>
    <p>
     white road toward Newburgh on the Hudson.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirty miles an hour the speedometer showed, then thirty-five and forty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again the drunken chauffeur, still master of his machine despite the
    </p>
    <p>
     poison pulsing in his dazed brain, snicked the little levers further
    </p>
    <p>
     down. Forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, the figures on the dial showed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the exhaust ripped in a crackling staccato, like a machine gun, as
    </p>
    <p>
     the chauffeur threw out the muffler. Behind, a long trail of dust rose,
    </p>
    <p>
     whirling in the air. Catherine, a sportswoman born, leaned back and
    </p>
    <p>
     smiled with keen pleasure, while her yellow veil, whipping sharply on
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind, let stray locks of that wonderful red-gold hair stream about
    </p>
    <p>
     her flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus she sped homeward, driven at a mad race by a man whose every sense
    </p>
    <p>
     was numbed and stultified by alcohol--homeward, along a road up which,
    </p>
    <p>
     far, far away, another man, keen, sober and alert, was trudging with a
    </p>
    <p>
     knapsack on his broad back, swinging a stick and whistling cheerily as
    </p>
    <p>
     he went.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fate, that strange moulder of human destinies, what had it in store for
    </p>
    <p>
     these two, this woman and this man? This daughter of a billionaire, and
    </p>
    <p>
     this young proletarian?
    </p>
    <p>
     Who could foresee, or, foreseeing, could believe what even now stood
    </p>
    <p>
     written on the Book of Destiny?
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     CHAPTER XIII.
    </head>
    <p>
     CATASTROPHE!
    </p>
    <p>
     For a time no danger seemed to threaten. Kate was not only fearless as a
    </p>
    <p>
     passenger, but equally intrepid at the wheel. Many a time and oft she
    </p>
    <p>
     had driven her father's highest-powered car at dizzying speeds along
    </p>
    <p>
     worse roads than the one her machine was now following. Velocity was to
    </p>
    <p>
     her a kind of stimulant, wonderfully pleasurable; and now, realizing
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing of the truth that Herrick was badly the worse for liquor, she
    </p>
    <p>
     leaned back in the tonneau, breathed the keen slashing air with delight,
    </p>
    <p>
     and let her eyes wander over the swiftly-changing panorama of forest,
    </p>
    <p>
     valley, lake and hill that, in ever new and more radiant beauty, sped
    </p>
    <p>
     away, away, as the huge car leaped down the smooth and rushing road.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dust and pebbles flew in the wake of the machine, as it gathered
    </p>
    <p>
     velocity. Beneath it, the highway sped like an endless white ribbon,
    </p>
    <p>
     whirling back and away with smooth rapidity. No common road, this, but
    </p>
    <p>
     one which the State authorities had very obligingly built especially for
    </p>
    <p>
     the use of millionaires' motor cars, all through the region of
    </p>
    <p>
     country-clubs, parks, bungalows and summer-resorts dotting the west
    </p>
    <p>
     shore region of the Hudson. Let the farmer truck his produce through mud
    </p>
    <p>
     and ruts, if he would. Let the country folk drive their ramshackle
    </p>
    <p>
     buggies over rocks and stumps, if they so chose. Nothing of that sort
    </p>
    <p>
     for millionaires! No, _they_ must have macadam and smooth, long curves,
    </p>
    <p>
     easy grades and--where the road swung high above the gleaming
    </p>
    <p>
     river--retaining walls to guard them from plunging into the palisaded
    </p>
    <p>
     abyss below.
    </p>
    <p>
     At just such a place it was, where the road made a sharper turn than any
    </p>
    <p>
     the drunken chauffeur had reckoned on, that catastrophe leaped out to
    </p>
    <p>
     shatter the rushing car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only a minute before, Kate--a little uneasy now, at the truly reckless
    </p>
    <p>
     speeding of the driver, and at the daredevil way in which he was taking
    </p>
    <p>
     curves without either sounding his siren or reducing speed--had touched
    </p>
    <p>
     him on the shoulder, with a command: "Not _quite_ so fast, Herrick! Be
    </p>
    <p>
     careful!"
    </p>
    <p>
     His only answer had been a drunken laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Careful nothing!" he slobbered, to himself. "You wanted speed--an'
    </p>
    <p>
     now--hc!--b'Jesus, you _get_--hc!--speed! _I_ ain't
    </p>
    <p>
     'fraid--are--hc!--_you_?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She had not heard the words, but had divined their meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Herrick!" she commanded sharply, leaning forward. "What's the matter
    </p>
    <p>
     with you? Obey me, do you hear? Not so fast!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A whiff of alcoholic breath suddenly told her the truth. For a second
    </p>
    <p>
     she sat there, as though petrified, with fear now for the first time
    </p>
    <p>
     clutching at her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stop at once!" she cried, gripping the man by the collar of his livery.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You--you're drunk, Herrick! I--I'll have you discharged, at once, when
    </p>
    <p>
     we get home. Stop, do you hear me? You're not fit to drive. I'll take
    </p>
    <p>
     the wheel myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But Herrick, hopelessly under the influence of the poison, which had
    </p>
    <p>
     now produced its full effect, paid no heed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Y'--can't dri' _thish_ car!" he muttered, in maudlin accents. "Too
    </p>
    <p>
     big--too heavy for--hc!--woman! I--_I_ dri' it all right, drunk or
    </p>
    <p>
     sober! Good chauffeur--good car--I know thish car! You won't fire
    </p>
    <p>
     me--hc!--for takin' drink or two, huh? I drive you all ri'--drive you to
    </p>
    <p>
     New York or to--hc!--Hell! Same thing, no difference, ha! ha!--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
     A sudden blaze of rage crimsoned the girl's face. In all her life she
    </p>
    <p>
     never had been thus spoken to. For a second she clenched her fist, as
    </p>
    <p>
     though to strike down this sodden brute there in the seat before her--a
    </p>
    <p>
     feat she would have been quite capable of. But second thought convinced
    </p>
    <p>
     her of the peril of such an act. Ahead of them a long down-grade
    </p>
    <p>
     stretched away, away, to a turn half-hidden under the arching greenery.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the car struck this slope, it leaped into ever greater speed; and
    </p>
    <p>
     now, under the erratic guidance of the lolling wretch at the wheel, it
    </p>
    <p>
     began to sway in long, unsteady curves, first toward one ditch, then the
    </p>
    <p>
     other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another woman would have screamed; might even have tried to jump out.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Kate was not of the hysteric sort. More practical, she.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got to climb over into the front seat," she realized in a flash,
    </p>
    <p>
     "and shut off the current--cut the power off--stop the car!"
    </p>
    <p>
     On the instant, she acted. But as she arose in the tonneau, Herrick,
    </p>
    <p>
     sensing her purpose, turned toward her in the sudden rage of complete
    </p>
    <p>
     intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Naw--naw y' don't!" he shouted, his face perfectly purple with fury
    </p>
    <p>
     and drink. "No woman--he!--runs this old boat while I'm aboard, see? Go
    </p>
    <p>
     on, fire me! _I_ don't give--damn! But you don't run--car! Sit down! _I_
    </p>
    <p>
     run car--New York or Hell--no matter which! _I_--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hurtling down the slope like a runaway comet, now wholly out of control,
    </p>
    <p>
     the powerful gray car leaped madly at the turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine, her heart sick at last with terror, caught a second's glimpse
    </p>
    <p>
     of forest, on one hand; of a stone wall with tree-tops on some steep
    </p>
    <p>
     abyss below, just grazing it, on the other. Through these trees she saw
    </p>
    <p>
     a momentary flash of water, far beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the leaping front wheels struck a cluster of loose pebbles, at the
    </p>
    <p>
     bend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wrenched from the drunkard's grip, the steering wheel jerked sharply
    </p>
    <p>
     round.
    </p>
    <p>
     A skidding--a crash--a cry!
    </p>
    <p>
     Over the roadway, vacant now, floated a tenuous cloud of dust and
    </p>
    <p>
     gasoline-vapor, commingled.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the retaining-wall at the left, a jagged gap appeared. Suddenly, far
    </p>
    <p>
     below, toward the river, a crashing detonation shattered harsh echoes
    </p>
    <p>
     from shore to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Came a quick flash of light; then thick, black, greasy smoke arose, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     wafting through the treetops, drifted away on the warm wind of that late
    </p>
    <p>
     June afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     A man, some quarter of a mile to southward, on the great highway, paused
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly at sound of this explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment he stood there listening acutely, a knotted stick in hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     his flannel shirt, open at the throat, showing a brown and corded neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     The heavy knapsack on his shoulders seemed no burden to that rugged
    </p>
    <p>
     strength, as he stood, poised and eager, every sense centered in keen
    </p>
    <p>
     attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Trouble ahead, there, by the Eternal!" he suddenly exclaimed. His eye
    </p>
    <p>
     had just caught sight of the first trailing wreaths of smoke, from up
    </p>
    <p>
     the cliff. "An auto's gone to smash, down there, or I'm a plute!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He needed no second thought to hurl him forward to the rescue. At a
    </p>
    <p>
     smart pace he ran, halloo'ing loudly, to tell the victims--should they
    </p>
    <p>
     still live--that help was at hand. At his right, extended the wall. At
    </p>
    <p>
     his left, a grove of sugar-maples, sparsely set, climbed a long slope,
    </p>
    <p>
     over the ridge of which the descending sun glowed warmly. Somewhat back
    </p>
    <p>
     from the road, a rough shack which served as a sugar-house for the
    </p>
    <p>
     spring sap-boiling, stood with gaping door, open to all the winds that
    </p>
    <p>
     blew. These things he noted subconsciously, as he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, all at once, as he rounded a sharp turn, he drew up with a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Down the cliff!" he exclaimed. "Knocked the wall clean out, and
    </p>
    <p>
     plunged! Holy Mackinaw, what a smash!"
    </p>
    <p>
     In a moment he had reached the scene of the catastrophe. His quick eye
    </p>
    <p>
     took in, almost at a glance, the skidding mark of the wheels, the ragged
    </p>
    <p>
     rent in the wall, the broken limbs of trees below.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Some wreck!" he ejaculated, dropping his stick and throwing off his
    </p>
    <p>
     knapsack. "_Hello, Hello, down there!_" he loudly hailed, scrambling
    </p>
    <p>
     through the gap.
    </p>
    <p>
     From below, no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     A silence, as of death, broken only by the echo of his own voice, was
    </p>
    <p>
     all that greeted his wild cry.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     THE RESCUE.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel Armstrong leaped, rather than clambered, through the gap in the
    </p>
    <p>
     wall, and, following the track of devastation through the trees,
    </p>
    <p>
     scrambled down the steep slope that led toward the Hudson.
    </p>
    <p>
     The forest looked as though a car of Juggernaut had passed that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Limbs and saplings lay in confusion, larger trees showed long wounds
    </p>
    <p>
     upon their bark, and here and there pieces of metal--a gray mud-guard, a
    </p>
    <p>
     car door, a wind-shield frame, with shattered plate glass still clinging
    </p>
    <p>
     to it--lay scattered on the precipitous declivity. Beside these, hanging
    </p>
    <p>
     to a branch, Gabriel saw a gaily-striped auto robe; and, further down, a
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy, fringed shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again he shouted, holding to a tree-trunk at the very edge of a cliff of
    </p>
    <p>
     limestone, and peering far down into the abyss where the car had taken
    </p>
    <p>
     its final plunge. Still no answer. But, from below, the heavy smoke
    </p>
    <p>
     still rose. And now, peering more keenly, Armstrong caught sight of the
    </p>
    <p>
     wreck itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There it is, and burning like the pit of Hell!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And--what's that, under it? A man?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He could not distinctly make out, so thick the foliage was. But it
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to him that, from under the jumbled wreckage of the blazing
    </p>
    <p>
     machine, something protruded, something that suggested a human form,
    </p>
    <p>
     horribly mangled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here's where I go down this cliff, whatever happens!" decided Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, acting on the instant, he began swinging himself down from tree to
    </p>
    <p>
     bush, from shrub to tuft of grass, clinging wherever handhold or
    </p>
    <p>
     foothold offered, digging his stout boots into every cleft and cranny of
    </p>
    <p>
     the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The height could not have been less than a hundred and fifty feet. By
    </p>
    <p>
     dint of wonderful strength and agility, and at the momentary risk of
    </p>
    <p>
     falling, himself, to almost certain death, Gabriel descended in less
    </p>
    <p>
     than ten minutes. The last quarter of the distance he practically fell,
    </p>
    <p>
     sliding at a tremendous rate, with boulders and loose earth cascading
    </p>
    <p>
     all about him in a shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     He landed close by the flaming ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lucky this isn't in the autumn, in the dry season!" thought he, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     approached. "If it were, this whole cliff-side, and the woods beyond,
    </p>
    <p>
     would be a roaring furnace. Some forest-fire, all right, if the woods
    </p>
    <p>
     weren't wet and full of sap!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Parting the brush, he made his way as close to the car as the intense
    </p>
    <p>
     heat would let him. The gasoline-tank, he understood, had burst with the
    </p>
    <p>
     shock, and, taking fire, had wrapped the car in an Inferno of
    </p>
    <p>
     unquenchable flame. Now, the woodwork was entirely gone; and of the
    </p>
    <p>
     wheels, as the long machine lay there on its back, only a few blazing
    </p>
    <p>
     spokes were left. The steel chassis and the engine were red-hot, twisted
    </p>
    <p>
     and broken as though a giant hammer had smitten them on some Vulcanic
    </p>
    <p>
     anvil.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's a few thousand dollars gone to the devil!" thought he. But his
    </p>
    <p>
     mind did not dwell on this phase of the disaster. Still he was hoping,
    </p>
    <p>
     against hope, that human life had not been dashed and roasted out, in
    </p>
    <p>
     the wreck. And again he shouted, as he worked his way to the other side
    </p>
    <p>
     of the machine--to the side which, seen from the cliff above, had seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to show him that inert and mangled body.
    </p>
    <p>
     All at once he stopped short, shielding his face with his hands, against
    </p>
    <p>
     the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good God!" he exclaimed; and involuntarily took off his cap, there in
    </p>
    <p>
     the presence of death.
    </p>
    <p>
     That the man _was_ dead, admitted of no question. Pinned under the
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy, glowing mass of metal, his body must already have been roasted to
    </p>
    <p>
     a char. The head could not be seen; but part of one shoulder and one arm
    </p>
    <p>
     protruded, with the coat burned off and the flesh horribly crackled;
    </p>
    <p>
     while, nearer Gabriel, a leg showed, with a regulation chauffeur's
    </p>
    <p>
     legging, also burned to a crisp.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing for me to do, here," said Gabriel aloud. "He's past all human
    </p>
    <p>
     help, poor chap. I don't imagine there can be anybody else in this
    </p>
    <p>
     wreck. I haven't seen anybody, and nobody has answered my shouts. What's
    </p>
    <p>
     to be done next?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He pondered a moment, then, looking at the license plate of the
    </p>
    <p>
     machine--its enamel now half cracked off, but the numbers still
    </p>
    <p>
     legible--drew out his note-book and pencil and made a memo of the
    </p>
    <p>
     figures.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Four-six-two-two, N.Y.," he read, again verifying his numbers. "That
    </p>
    <p>
     will identify things. And now--the quicker I get back on the road again,
    </p>
    <p>
     and reach a telephone at West Point, the better."
    </p>
    <p>
     Accordingly, after a brief search through the bushes near at hand, for
    </p>
    <p>
     any other victim--a search which brought no results--he set to work once
    </p>
    <p>
     more to climb the cliff above him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fire, though still raging, was obviously dying down. In half an
    </p>
    <p>
     hour, he knew, it would be dead. There was no use in trying to
    </p>
    <p>
     extinguish it, for gasoline defies water, and no sand was to be had
    </p>
    <p>
     along that rocky river shore.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let her burn herself out," judged Gabriel. "She can't do any harm, now.
    </p>
    <p>
     The road for mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He found the upward path infinitely more difficult than the downward,
    </p>
    <p>
     and was forced to make a long detour and do some hard climbing that left
    </p>
    <p>
     him spent and sweating, before he again approached the gap in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pausing here to breathe, a minute or two, he once more peered down at
    </p>
    <p>
     the still-smoking ruin far below. And, as he stood there all at once he
    </p>
    <p>
     thought he heard a sound not very far away to his right.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sound--a groan, a half-inchoate murmur--a cry!
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly his every sense grew keen. Holding his breath he listened
    </p>
    <p>
     intently. Was it a cry? Or had the breeze but swayed one tree limb
    </p>
    <p>
     against another; or did some boatman's hail, from far across the river,
    </p>
    <p>
     but drift upward to him on the cliff?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello! _Hello_!" he shouted again. "Anybody there?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more he listened; and now, once more, he heard the sound--this time
    </p>
    <p>
     he knew it was a cry for help!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where are you?" shouted he, plunging forward along the steep side of
    </p>
    <p>
     the cliff. "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
     No answer, save a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Coming! Coming!" he hailed loudly. Then, guided as it seemed by
    </p>
    <p>
     instinct, almost as much as by the vague direction of the moaning call,
    </p>
    <p>
     he ploughed his way through brush and briar, on rescue bent.
    </p>
    <p>
     All at once he stopped short in his tracks, wild-eyed, a stammering
    </p>
    <p>
     exclamation on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A woman!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
     True. There, lying as though violently flung, a woman was half-crouched,
    </p>
    <p>
     half-prone behind the roots of a huge maple that leaned out far above a
    </p>
    <p>
     sheer declivity.
    </p>
    <p>
     He saw torn clothing, through the foliage; a white hand, out-stretched
    </p>
    <p>
     and bleeding; a mass of golden-coppery hair that lay dishevelled on the
    </p>
    <p>
     bed of moss and last autumn's leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A woman! Dying?" he thought, with a sudden stab of pity in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, forcing his way along, he reached her, and fell upon his knees at
    </p>
    <p>
     her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not dead! Not dying! Thank God!" he exclaimed. One glance showed him
    </p>
    <p>
     she would live. Though an ugly gash upon her forehead had bathed her
    </p>
    <p>
     face in blood, and though he knew not but bones were broken, he
    </p>
    <p>
     recognized the fact that she was now returning, fast, to consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already she had opened her eyes--wild eyes, understanding nothing--and
    </p>
    <p>
     was staring up at him in dazed, blank terror. Then one hand came up to
    </p>
    <p>
     her face; and, even as he lifted her in both his powerful arms, she
    </p>
    <p>
     began to sob hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
     He knew the value of that weeping, and made no attempt to stop it. The
    </p>
    <p>
     overwrought nerves, he understood, must find some outlet. Asking no
    </p>
    <p>
     question, speaking no word--for Gabriel was a man of action, not
    </p>
    <p>
     speech--he gathered her up as though she had been a child. A tall woman,
    </p>
    <p>
     she; almost as tall as he himself, and proportioned like a Venus. Yet to
    </p>
    <p>
     him her weight was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure-footed, now, and bursting through the brambles with fine energy, he
    </p>
    <p>
     carried her to the gap in the wall, up through it, and so to the roadway
    </p>
    <p>
     itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where--where am I?" the woman cried incoherently. "O--what--where--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're all right!" he exclaimed. "Just a little accident, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't worry! I'll take care of you. Just keep quiet, now, and don't
    </p>
    <p>
     think of anything. You'll be all right, in no time!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But she still wept and cried out to know where she might be and what had
    </p>
    <p>
     happened. Obviously, Gabriel saw, her reason had not yet fully returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     His first aim must be to bathe her wound, find out what damage had been
    </p>
    <p>
     done, and keeping her quiet, try to get help.
    </p>
    <p>
     Swiftly he thought. Here he and the woman were, miles from any
    </p>
    <p>
     settlement or house, nearly in the middle of a long stretch of road that
    </p>
    <p>
     skirted the river through dense woods. At any time a motor might come
    </p>
    <p>
     along; and then again, one might not arrive for hours. No dependence
    </p>
    <p>
     could be put on this. There was no telephone for a long distance back;
    </p>
    <p>
     and even had one been near he would not have ventured to leave the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could he carry her back to Fort Clinton, the last settlement he had
    </p>
    <p>
     passed through? Impossible! No man's strength could stand such a
    </p>
    <p>
     tremendous task. And even had it been within Gabriel's means, he would
    </p>
    <p>
     have chosen otherwise. For most of all the girl needed rest and quiet
    </p>
    <p>
     and immediate care. To bear her all that distance in his arms might
    </p>
    <p>
     produce serious, even fatal results.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No!" he decided. "I must do what I can for her, here and now, and trust
    </p>
    <p>
     to luck to send help in an auto, down this road!"
    </p>
    <p>
     His next thought was that bandages and wraps would be needed for her cut
    </p>
    <p>
     and to make her a bed. Instantly he remembered the shawl and the big
    </p>
    <p>
     auto-robe that he had seen caught among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I must have those at once!" he realized. "When the machine went over
    </p>
    <p>
     the edge, they were thrown out, just as the girl was. A miracle she
    </p>
    <p>
     wasn't carried down, with the car, and crushed or burned to death down
    </p>
    <p>
     there by the river, with that poor devil of a chauffeur!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Laying her down in the soft grass along the wall, he ran back to where
    </p>
    <p>
     the wraps were, and, detaching them from the branches, quickly regained
    </p>
    <p>
     the road once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now for the old sugar-house in the maple-grove," said he. "Poor
    </p>
    <p>
     shelter, but the best to be had. Thank heaven it's fair weather, and
    </p>
    <p>
     warm!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The task was awkward, to carry both the girl and the bulky robes, but
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel was equal to it She had by now regained some measure of
    </p>
    <p>
     rationality; and though very pale and shaken, manifested her nerve and
    </p>
    <p>
     courage by no longer weeping or asking questions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she lay in his arms, eyes closed, with the blood stiffening on
    </p>
    <p>
     her face; and let him bear her whither he would. She seemed to sense his
    </p>
    <p>
     strength and mastery, his tender care and complete command of the
    </p>
    <p>
     situation. And, like a hurt and tired child, outworn and suffering, she
    </p>
    <p>
     yielded herself, unquestioningly, to his ministrations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus Gabriel, the discharged, blacklisted, outcast rebel and
    </p>
    <p>
     proletarian, bore in his arms of mercy and compassion the only daughter
    </p>
    <p>
     of old Isaac Flint, his enemy, Flint the would-be master of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus he bore the woman who had been betrothed to "Tiger" Waldron,
    </p>
    <p>
     unscrupulous and cruel partner in that scheme of dominance and
    </p>
    <p>
     enslavement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such was the meeting of this woman and this man. Thus, in his arms, he
    </p>
    <p>
     carried her to the old sugar-house.
    </p>
    <p>
     And far below, the mighty river gleamed, unheeding the tragedy that had
    </p>
    <p>
     been enacted on its shores, unmindful of the threads of destiny even now
    </p>
    <p>
     being spun by the swift shuttles of Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the branches, above Gabriel and Catherine, birdsong and golden
    </p>
    <p>
     sunlight seemed to prophesy. But what this message might be, neither the
    </p>
    <p>
     woman nor the man had any thought or dream.

    </head>
    <p>
     AN HOUR AND A PARTING.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arriving at the sugar-house, tired yet strong, Gabriel put the wounded
    </p>
    <p>
     girl down, quickly raked together a few armfuls of dead leaves, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     most sheltered corner of the ramshackle structure, and laid the heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     auto-robe upon this improvised bed. Then he helped his patient to lie
    </p>
    <p>
     down, there, and bade her wait till he got water to wash and dress her
    </p>
    <p>
     cut.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't worry about anything," he reassured her. "You're alive, and
    </p>
    <p>
     that's the main thing, now. I'll see you through with this, whatever
    </p>
    <p>
     happens. Just keep calm, and don't let anything distress you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at him with big, anxious eyes--eyes where still the full
    </p>
    <p>
     light of understanding had not yet returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It--it all happened so suddenly!" she managed to articulate. "He was
    </p>
    <p>
     drunk--the chauffeur. The car ran away. Where is it? Where is
    </p>
    <p>
     Herrick--the man?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know," Gabriel lied promptly and with force. Not for worlds
    </p>
    <p>
     would he have excited her with the truth. "Never you mind about that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just lie still, now, till I come back!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Already, among the rusty utensils that had served for the
    </p>
    <p>
     "sugaring-off," the previous spring, he had routed out a tin pail. He
    </p>
    <p>
     kicked a quantity of leaves in under the sheet-iron open stove, flung
    </p>
    <p>
     some sticks atop of them, and started a little blaze. Warm water, he
    </p>
    <p>
     reflected, would serve better than cold in removing that clotting blood
    </p>
    <p>
     and dressing the hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, saying no further word, but filled with admiration for the girl's
    </p>
    <p>
     pluck, he seized the pail and started for water.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nerve?" he said to himself, as he ran down the road toward a little
    </p>
    <p>
     brook he remembered having crossed, a few hundred yards to southward.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nerve, indeed! Not one complaint about her own injuries! Not a word of
    </p>
    <p>
     lamentation! If this isn't a thoroughbred, whoever or whatever she is, I
    </p>
    <p>
     never saw one!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He returned, presently, with the pail nearly full of cold and sparkling
    </p>
    <p>
     water. Ignoring rust, he made her drink as deeply as she would, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     set a dipperful of water on the now hot sheet-iron.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, tearing a strip off the shawl, he made ready for his work as an
    </p>
    <p>
     amateur physician.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me," said he, kneeling there beside her in the hut which was
    </p>
    <p>
     already beginning to grow dusk, "except for this cut on your forehead,
    </p>
    <p>
     do you feel any injury? Think you've got any broken bones? See if you
    </p>
    <p>
     can move your legs and arms, all right."
    </p>
    <p>
     She obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing broken, I guess," she answered. "What a miracle! Please leave
    </p>
    <p>
     me, now. I can wash my own hurt. Go--go find Herrick! He needs you worse
    </p>
    <p>
     than I do!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No he doesn't!" blurted Gabriel with such conviction that she
    </p>
    <p>
     understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean?" she queried, as he brought the dipper of now tepid water to
    </p>
    <p>
     her side. "He--he's dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He hesitated to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dead! Yes, I understand!" she interpreted his silence. "You needn't
    </p>
    <p>
     tell me. I know!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said he. "Your chauffeur has paid the penalty of trying to drive
    </p>
    <p>
     a six-cylinder car with alcohol. Now, think no more of him! Here, let me
    </p>
    <p>
     see how badly you're cut."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let me sit up, first," she begged. "I--I'm not hurt enough to be lying
    </p>
    <p>
     here like--like an invalid!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to rise, but with a strong hand on her shoulder he forced her
    </p>
    <p>
     back. She shuddered, with the horror of the chauffeur's death strong
    </p>
    <p>
     upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please lie still," he begged. "You've had a terrific shock, and have
    </p>
    <p>
     lived through it by a miracle, indeed. You're wounded and still
    </p>
    <p>
     bleeding. You _must_ be quiet!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The tone in his voice admitted no argument. Submissive now to his
    </p>
    <p>
     greater strength, this daughter of wealth and power lay back, closed her
    </p>
    <p>
     tired eyes and let the revolutionist, the proletarian, minister to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dipping the piece of shawl into the warm water, he deftly moistened the
    </p>
    <p>
     dried blood on her brow and cheek, and washed it all away. He cleansed
    </p>
    <p>
     her sullied hair, as well, and laid it back from the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me if I hurt you, now," he bade, gently as a woman. "I've got to
    </p>
    <p>
     wash the cut itself."
    </p>
    <p>
     She answered nothing, but lay quite still. And so, hardly wincing, she
    </p>
    <p>
     let him lave the jagged wound that stretched from her right temple up
    </p>
    <p>
     into the first tendrils of the glorious red-gold hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "H'm!" thought Gabriel, as he now observed the cut with close
    </p>
    <p>
     attention. "I'm afraid there'll have to be some stitches taken here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But of this he said nothing. All he told her was: "Nothing to worry
    </p>
    <p>
     over. You'll be as good as new in a few days. As a miracle, it's _some_
    </p>
    <p>
     miracle!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Having completed the cleansing of the cut, he fetched his knapsack and
    </p>
    <p>
     produced a clean handkerchief, which he folded and laid over the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
     This pad he secured in place by a long bandage cut from the edge of the
    </p>
    <p>
     shawl and tied securely round her shapely head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There," said he, surveying his improvisation with considerable
    </p>
    <p>
     satisfaction. "Now you'll do, till we can undertake the next thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sorry I haven't any brandy to give you, or anything of that sort. The
    </p>
    <p>
     fact is, I don't use it, and have none with me. How do you feel, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened her eyes and looked up at him with the ghost of a smile on
    </p>
    <p>
     her pale lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, much, much better, thank you!" she answered. "I don't need any
    </p>
    <p>
     brandy. I'm--awfully strong, really. In a little while I'll be all
    </p>
    <p>
     right. Just give me a little more water, and--and tell me--who are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who am I?" he queried, holding up her head while she drank from the tin
    </p>
    <p>
     cup he had now taken from his knapsack. "I? Oh, just an out-of-work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nobody of any interest to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A certain tinge of bitterness crept into his voice. In health, he knew,
    </p>
    <p>
     a woman of this class would not suffer him even to touch her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Don't_ ask me who I am, please. And I--I won't ask _your_ name. We're
    </p>
    <p>
     of different worlds, I guess. But for the moment, Fate has levelled the
    </p>
    <p>
     barriers. Just let it go at that. And now, if you can stay here, all
    </p>
    <p>
     right; perhaps I can hike back to the next house, below here, and
    </p>
    <p>
     telephone, and summon help."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How far is it?" she asked, looking at him with wonder in her lovely
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes--wonder, and new thoughts, and a strange kind of longing to know
    </p>
    <p>
     more of this extraordinary man, so strong, so gentle, so unwilling to
    </p>
    <p>
     divulge himself or ask her name.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How far?" he repeated. "Oh, four or five miles. I can make it in no
    </p>
    <p>
     time. And with luck, I can have an auto and a doctor here before dark.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, does that suit you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't go, please," she answered. "I--I may be still a little weak and
    </p>
    <p>
     foolish, but--somehow, I don't want to be left alone. I want to be kept
    </p>
    <p>
     from remembering, from thinking of those last, awful moments when the
    </p>
    <p>
     car was running away; when it struck the wall, at the turn; when I was
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown out, and--and knew no more. Don't go just yet," the girl
    </p>
    <p>
     entreated, covering her eyes with both hands, as though to shut out the
    </p>
    <p>
     horrible vision of the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right," Gabriel answered. "Just as you please. Only, if I stay, you
    </p>
    <p>
     must promise to stop thinking about the accident, and try to pull
    </p>
    <p>
     together."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I promise," she agreed, looking at him with strange eyes. "Oh dear,"
    </p>
    <p>
     she added, with feminine inconsequentiality, "my hair's all down, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord knows where the pins are!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He smiled to himself as she managed, with the aid of such few hairpins
    </p>
    <p>
     as remained, to coil the coppery meshes once more round her head and
    </p>
    <p>
     even somewhat over the bandage, and secure them in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     At sight of his face as he watched her, she too smiled wanly--the first
    </p>
    <p>
     time he had seen a real smile on her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm only a woman, after all," she apologized. "You don't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can't. But no matter. Tell me--why need you go, at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why? For help, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's sure to be a motor, or something, along this road, before very
    </p>
    <p>
     long," she answered. "Put up some signal or other, to stop it. That will
    </p>
    <p>
     save you a long, long walk, and save me from--remembering! I need you
    </p>
    <p>
     here with me," she added earnestly. "Don't go--please!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right, as you will," the man made reply. "I'll rig a danger-signal
    </p>
    <p>
     on the road; and then all we can do will be to wait."
    </p>
    <p>
     This plan he immediately put into effect, setting his knapsack in the
    </p>
    <p>
     middle of the road and piling up brush and limbs of trees about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There," he said to himself, as he surveyed the result, "no car will get
    </p>
    <p>
     by _that_, without noticing it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he returned to the sugar-house, some hundred yards back from the
    </p>
    <p>
     highway in the grove, now already beginning to grow dim with the shadows
    </p>
    <p>
     of approaching nightfall. The glowing coals of the fire gleamed redly,
    </p>
    <p>
     through the rough place. The girl, still lying on her bed of leaves and
    </p>
    <p>
     auto-robes, with the mutilated shawl drawn over her, looked up at him
    </p>
    <p>
     with an expression of trust and gratitude. For a second, only one,
    </p>
    <p>
     something quick and vital gripped at the wanderer's heart--some vague,
    </p>
    <p>
     intangible longing for a home and a woman, a longing old as our race,
    </p>
    <p>
     deep-planted in the inmost citadel of every man's soul. But,
    </p>
    <p>
     half-impatiently, he drove the thought away, dismissed it, and, smiling
    </p>
    <p>
     down at her with cheerful eyes and white, even teeth, said reassuringly:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Everything's all right now. The first machine that passes, will take
    </p>
    <p>
     you to civilization."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you?" she asked. "What of you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Me? Oh, I'll hike," he answered. "I'll plug along just as I was doing
    </p>
    <p>
     when I found you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where to?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, north."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Work. Please don't question me. I'd rather you wouldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
     She pondered a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you--what they call a--workingman?" she presently resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said he. "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And are you happy?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes. In a way. Or shall be, when I've done what I mean to do."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But--forgive me--you're very poor?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not at all! I have, at this present moment, more than eighteen dollars
    </p>
    <p>
     in my pocket, and I have _these_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He showed her his two hands, big and sinewed, capable and strong.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eighteen dollars," she mused, half to herself. "Why, I have spent that,
    </p>
    <p>
     and more, for a single ounce of a new perfume--something very rare, you
    </p>
    <p>
     know, from Japan."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Indeed? Well, don't tell _me_," he replied. "I'm not interested in how
    </p>
    <p>
     you spend money, but how you get it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get it? Oh, father gives me my allowance, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And he squeezes it out of the common people?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced at him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You--you aren't a Socialist, into the bargain, are you?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
     "At your service," he bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This is strange, strange indeed," she said. "Tell me your name."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," he refused. "I'd still rather not. Nor shall I ask yours. Please
    </p>
    <p>
     don't volunteer it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Came a moment's silence, there in the darkening hut, with the fire-glow
    </p>
    <p>
     red upon their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Happy," said the girl. "You say you're happy. While I--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are not unhappy, surely?" asked Gabriel, leaning forward as he sat
    </p>
    <p>
     there beside her, and gazing keenly into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How should I know?" she answered. "Unhappy? No, perhaps not. But
    </p>
    <p>
     vacant--empty--futile!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I believe you," Gabriel judged. "You tell me no news. And as you
    </p>
    <p>
     are, you will ever be. You will live so and die so. No, I won't preach.
    </p>
    <p>
     I won't proselytize. I won't even explain. It would be useless. You are
    </p>
    <p>
     one pole, I the other. And the world--the whole wide world--lies
    </p>
    <p>
     between!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're a Socialist," said she. "What does it mean to be a Socialist?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You couldn't understand, if I told you," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, because your ideas and environments and interests and everything
    </p>
    <p>
     have been so different from mine--because you're what you are--because
    </p>
    <p>
     you can never be anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean Socialism is something beyond my understanding?" she demanded,
    </p>
    <p>
     piqued. "Of course, that's nonsense. I'm a human being. I've got brains,
    </p>
    <p>
     haven't I? I can understand a scheme of dividing up, or levelling down,
    </p>
    <p>
     or whatever it is, even if I can't believe in it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He smiled oddly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You've just proved, by what you've said," he answered slowly, "that
    </p>
    <p>
     your whole concepts are mistaken. Socialism isn't anything like what you
    </p>
    <p>
     think it is, and if I should try to explain it, you'd raise ten thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     futile objections, and beg the question, and defeat my object of
    </p>
    <p>
     explanation by your very inability to get the point of view. So you
    </p>
    <p>
     see--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I see that I want to know more!" she exclaimed, with determination. "If
    </p>
    <p>
     there's any branch of human knowledge that lies outside my reasoning
    </p>
    <p>
     powers, it's time I found that fact out. I thought Socialists were wild,
    </p>
    <p>
     crazy, erratic cranks; but if you're one, then I seem to have been
    </p>
    <p>
     wrong. You look rational enough, and you talk in an eminently sane
    </p>
    <p>
     manner."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank you," he replied, ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't be sarcastic!" she retorted. "I only meant--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's all right, anyhow," said he. "You've simply got the old, stupid,
    </p>
    <p>
     wornout ideas of your class. You can't grasp this new ideal, rising
    </p>
    <p>
     through the ruck and waste and sin and misery of the present system. I
    </p>
    <p>
     don't blame you. You're a product of your environment. You can't help
    </p>
    <p>
     it. With that environment, how can you sense the newer and more vital
    </p>
    <p>
     ideas of the day?"
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment she fixed eager eyes on him, in silence. Then asked she:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ideals? You mean that Socialism has ideals, and that it's not all a
    </p>
    <p>
     matter of tearing down and dividing up, and destroying everything good
    </p>
    <p>
     and noble and right--all the accumulated wisdom and resources of the
    </p>
    <p>
     world?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who handed you that bunk?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Father told me Socialism was all that, and more,"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's your father's business?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, investments, stocks, bonds, industrial development and all that
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of thing."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm!" he grunted. "I thought as much!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean that father misinformed me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rather!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, if he did, what is Socialism?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Socialism," answered the young man slowly, while he fixed his eyes on
    </p>
    <p>
     the smouldering fire, "Socialism is a political movement, a concept of
    </p>
    <p>
     life, a philosophy, an interpretation, a prophecy, an ideal. It embraces
    </p>
    <p>
     history, economics, science, art, religion, literature and every phase
    </p>
    <p>
     of human activity. It explains life, points the way to better things,
    </p>
    <p>
     gives us hope, strengthens the weary and heavy-laden, bids us look
    </p>
    <p>
     upward and onward, and constitutes the most sublime ideal ever conceived
    </p>
    <p>
     by the soul of man!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can this be true?" the girl demanded, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not only can, but is! Socialism would free the world from slavery and
    </p>
    <p>
     slaves, from war, poverty, prostitution, vice and crime; would cleanse
    </p>
    <p>
     the sores of our rotting capitalism, would loose the gyves from the
    </p>
    <p>
     fettered hands of mankind, would bid the imprisoned soul of man awake to
    </p>
    <p>
     nobler and to purer things! How? The answer to that would take me weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     You would have to read and study many books, to learn the entire truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     But I am telling you the substance of the ideal--a realizable ideal, and
    </p>
    <p>
     no chimera--when I say that Socialism sums up all that is good, and
    </p>
    <p>
     banishes all that is evil! And do you wonder that I love and serve it,
    </p>
    <p>
     all my life?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She peered at him in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You serve it? How?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By spreading it abroad; by speaking for it, working for it, fighting
    </p>
    <p>
     for it! By the spoken and the printed word! By every act and through
    </p>
    <p>
     every means whereby I can bring it nearer and nearer realization!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're a dreamer, a visionary, a fanatic!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You think so? No, I can't agree. Time will judge that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, I travel up and down the earth, spreading Socialism."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what do you get out of it, personally?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I? What do you mean? I never thought of that question."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean, money. What do you make out of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I get a few jail-sentences, once in a while; now and then a crack over
    </p>
    <p>
     the head with a policeman's billy, or maybe a peek down the muzzle of a
    </p>
    <p>
     rifle. I get--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean that you're a martyr?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "By no means! I've never even thought of being called such. This is a
    </p>
    <p>
     privilege, this propaganda of ours. It's the greatest privilege in the
    </p>
    <p>
     world--bringing the word of life and hope and joy to a crushed, bleeding
    </p>
    <p>
     and despairing world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She thought a moment, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're a poet, I believe!" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, not that. Only a worker in the ranks."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But do you write poetry?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I write verses. You'd hardly call them poetry!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Verses? About Socialism?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Will you give me some?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me some of them."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course not! I can't recite my verses! They aren't worth bothering
    </p>
    <p>
     you with!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's for me to judge. Let me hear something of that kind. If you only
    </p>
    <p>
     knew how terribly much you interest me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course I do! Please let me hear something you've written!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He pondered a moment, then in his well-modulated, deep-toned voice
    </p>
    <p>
     began:
    </p>
    <p>
     _HESPERIDES_.
    </p>
    <p>
     I.
    </p>
    <p>
     My feet, used to pine-needles, moss and turf,
    </p>
    <p>
     And the gray boulders at the lip o' the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
     Where the cold brine jets up its creamy surf,
    </p>
    <p>
     Now tread once more these city ways, unloved by me,
    </p>
    <p>
     Hateful and hot, gross with iniquity.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so I grieve,
    </p>
    <p>
     Grieve when I wake, or at high blinding noon
    </p>
    <p>
     Or when the moon
    </p>
    <p>
     Mocks this sad Ninevah where the throngs weave
    </p>
    <p>
     Their jostling ways by day, their paths by night;
    </p>
    <p>
     Where darkness is not--where the streets burn bright
    </p>
    <p>
     With hectic fevers, eloquent of death!
    </p>
    <p>
     I gasp for breath....
    </p>
    <p>
     Visions have I, visions! So sweet they seem
    </p>
    <p>
     That from this welter of men and things I turn, to dream
    </p>
    <p>
     Of the dim Wood-world, calling out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where forest-virgins I half glimpse, half see
    </p>
    <p>
     With cool mysterious fingers beckoning!
    </p>
    <p>
     Where vine-wreathed woodland altars sunlit burn,
    </p>
    <p>
     Or Dryads dance their mystic rounds and sing,
    </p>
    <p>
     Sing high, sing low, with magic cadences
    </p>
    <p>
     That once the wild oaks of Dodona heard;
    </p>
    <p>
     And every wood-note bids me burst asunder
    </p>
    <p>
     The bonds that hold me from the leaf-hid bird.
    </p>
    <p>
     I quaff thee, O Nepenthe! Ah, the wonder
    </p>
    <p>
     Grows, that there be who buy their wealth, their ease
    </p>
    <p>
     By damning serfs to cities, hot and blurred,
    </p>
    <p>
     Far from thy golden quest, Hesperides!...
    </p>
    <p>
     II.
    </p>
    <p>
     I see this August sun again
    </p>
    <p>
     Sheer up high heaven wheel his angry way;
    </p>
    <p>
     And hordes of men
    </p>
    <p>
     Bleared with unrestful sleep rise up another day,
    </p>
    <p>
     Their bodies racked with aftermaths of toil.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over the city, in each gasping street,
    </p>
    <p>
     Shudders a haze of heat,
    </p>
    <p>
     Reverberant from pillar, span and plinth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more, cribbed in this monstrous labyrinth
    </p>
    <p>
     Sacrificed to the Minotaur of Greed
    </p>
    <p>
     Men bear the turmoil, glare, sweat, brute inharmonies;
    </p>
    <p>
     Denial of each simplest human need,
    </p>
    <p>
     Loss of life's meaning as day lags on day;
    </p>
    <p>
     And my rebellious spirit rises, flies
    </p>
    <p>
     In dreams to the green quiet wood away,
    </p>
    <p>
     Away! Away!
    </p>
    <p>
     III.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, and now...I feel the forest-moss...
    </p>
    <p>
     Come! On these moss-beds let me lie with Pan,
    </p>
    <p>
     Twined with the ivy-vine in tendrill'd curls,
    </p>
    <p>
     And I will hold all gold, that hampers man,
    </p>
    <p>
     Only the ashes of base, barren dross!
    </p>
    <p>
     On with the love-dance of the pagan girls!
    </p>
    <p>
     The pagan girls with lips all rosy-red,
    </p>
    <p>
     With breasts upgirt and foreheads garlanded,
    </p>
    <p>
     With fair white foreheads nobly garlanded!
    </p>
    <p>
     With sandalled feet that weave the magic ring!
    </p>
    <p>
     Now...let them sing,
    </p>
    <p>
     And I will pipe a tune that all may hear,
    </p>
    <p>
     To bid them mind the time of my wild rhyme;
    </p>
    <p>
     To warn profaning feet lest they draw near.
    </p>
    <p>
     Away! Away! Beware these mystic trees!
    </p>
    <p>
     Who dares to quest you now, Hesperides?
    </p>
    <p>
     IV.
    </p>
    <p>
     Great men of song, what sing ye? Woodland meadows?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rocks, trees and rills where sunlight glints to gold?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sing ye the hills, adown whose sides blue shadows
    </p>
    <p>
     Creep when the westering day is growing old?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sing ye the brooks where in the purling shallows
    </p>
    <p>
     The small fish dart and gleam?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sing ye the pale green tresses of the willows
    </p>
    <p>
     That stoop to kiss the stream?
    </p>
    <p>
     Or sing ye burning streets, foul with the breath
    </p>
    <p>
     Of sweatshop, tenement, where endlessly
    </p>
    <p>
     Spawned swarms of folk serve tyrant masters twain--
    </p>
    <p>
     Profit, and his twin-brother, grinning Death?
    </p>
    <p>
     Where millions toil, hedged off from aught save pain?
    </p>
    <p>
     Far from thee ever, O mine Arcady?...
    </p>
    <p>
     His voice ceased and silence fell between the man and woman in the old
    </p>
    <p>
     sugar-house. Gabriel sat there by the dying fire, which cast its ruddy
    </p>
    <p>
     light over his strongly virile face, and gazed into the coals. The girl,
    </p>
    <p>
     lying on the rude bed, her face eager, her slim strong hands tightly
    </p>
    <p>
     clasped, had almost forgotten to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That--that is wonderful!" she cried, a tremor of enthusiasm in her
    </p>
    <p>
     voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No compliments, please," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not complimenting you! I think it _is_ wonderful. You're a true
    </p>
    <p>
     poet!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wish I were--so I might use it all for Socialism!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You could make a fortune, if you'd work for some paper or
    </p>
    <p>
     magazine--some regular one, I mean, not Socialist."
    </p>
    <p>
     He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dead sea fruit," he answered. "Fairy gold, fading in the clutch,
    </p>
    <p>
     worthless through and through. No, if my work has any merit, it's all
    </p>
    <p>
     for Socialism, now and ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence again. Neither now found a word to say, but their eyes met and
    </p>
    <p>
     read each other; and a kind of solemn hush seemed to lie over their
    </p>
    <p>
     hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as they sat there, looking each at each--for now the girl had
    </p>
    <p>
     raised herself on the crude bed and was supporting herself with one
    </p>
    <p>
     hand--a sudden sound of a motor, on the road, awakened them from their
    </p>
    <p>
     musing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Came the raucous wail of a siren. Then the engine-exhaust ceased; and a
    </p>
    <p>
     voice, raised in some annoyance, hailed loudly through the maple-grove:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello! Hello? What's wrong here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel stepped to the sugar-house door:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here! Come here!" he shouted in a ringing voice that echoed wildly from
    </p>
    <p>
     between his hollowed palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the motorist still sat there, uncomprehending, Gabriel made his way
    </p>
    <p>
     toward the road.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Accident here," said he. "Girl in here, injured. Can you take her to
    </p>
    <p>
     the nearest town, at once? She needs a doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly the man was out of his car, and hastening toward Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eh? What?" he asked. "Anything serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
     In a few words, Gabriel told him the outlines of the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The quicker you get the girl to a town, and let her have a doctor and
    </p>
    <p>
     communication with her family, the better," he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right! I'll do all in my power," said the other, a rather stout,
    </p>
    <p>
     well-to-do, vulgar-looking man.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good! This way, then!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The man followed Gabriel to the sugar-house. They found the girl already
    </p>
    <p>
     on her feet, standing there a bit unsteadily, but with determination to
    </p>
    <p>
     be game, in every feature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Five minutes later she was in the new-comer's car, which had been turned
    </p>
    <p>
     around and now was headed back toward Haverstraw. The shawl and robe
    </p>
    <p>
     serving her as wraps, she was made comfortable in the tonneau.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Think you can stand it, all right?" asked Gabriel, as he took in his
    </p>
    <p>
     the hand she extended. "In half an hour, you'll be under a doctor's
    </p>
    <p>
     care, and your father will be on his way toward you."
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded, and for a second tightened the grasp of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I--I'm not even going to know who you are?" she asked, a strange tone
    </p>
    <p>
     in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," he answered. "And now, good luck, and good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good-bye," she echoed, her voice almost inaudible. "I--I won't forget
    </p>
    <p>
     you."
    </p>
    <p>
     He made no answer, but only smiled in a peculiar way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as the car rolled slowly forward, their hands separated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel, bareheaded and with level gaze, stood there in the middle of
    </p>
    <p>
     the great highway, looking after her. A minute, under the darkening
    </p>
    <p>
     arches of the forest road, he saw her, still. Then the car swung round
    </p>
    <p>
     a bend, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had she waved her hand at him? He could not tell. Motionless he stood, a
    </p>
    <p>
     while, then cleared away the barrier of branches that obstructed the
    </p>
    <p>
     road, took up his knapsack, and with slow steps returned to the
    </p>
    <p>
     sugar-house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost on the threshold, a white something caught his eye. He picked it
    </p>
    <p>
     up. Her handkerchief! A moment he held the dainty, filmy thing in his
    </p>
    <p>
     rough hand. A vague perfume reached his nostrils, disquieting and
    </p>
    <p>
     seductive.
    </p>
    <p>
     "More than eighteen dollars an ounce, perhaps!" he exclaimed, with
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden bitterness; but still he did not throw the handkerchief away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, he looked at it more keenly. In one corner, the fading light
    </p>
    <p>
     just showed him some initials. He studied them, a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "C.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;F." he read. Then, yielding to a sudden impulse, he
    </p>
    <p>
     folded the kerchief and put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     He entered the sugar-house, to make sure, before departing, that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     left no danger of fire behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another impulse bade him sit down on a rough box, there, before the
    </p>
    <p>
     dying embers. He gazed at the bed of leaves, a while, immersed in
    </p>
    <p>
     thought, then filled his pipe and lighted it with a glowing brand, and
    </p>
    <p>
     sat there--while the night came--smoking and musing, in a reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
     The overpowering lure of the woman who had lain in his arms, as he had
    </p>
    <p>
     borne her thither; her breath upon his face; the perfume of her, even
    </p>
    <p>
     her blood that he had washed away--all these were working on his senses,
    </p>
    <p>
     still. But most of all he seemed to see her eyes, there in the
    </p>
    <p>
     ember-lit gloom, and hear her voice, and feel her lithe young body and
    </p>
    <p>
     her breast against his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a long time he sat there, thinking, dreaming, smoking, till the last
    </p>
    <p>
     shred of tobacco was burned out in the heel of his briar; till the last
    </p>
    <p>
     ember had winked and died under the old sheet-iron stove.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last, with a peculiar laugh, he rose, slung the knapsack once more on
    </p>
    <p>
     his shoulders, settled his cap upon his head, and made ready to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
     But still, one moment, he lingered in the doorway. Lingered and looked
    </p>
    <p>
     back, as though in his mind's eye he would have borne the place away
    </p>
    <p>
     with him forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly he stooped, picked up a leaf from the bed where she had lain,
    </p>
    <p>
     and put that, too, in his pocket where the kerchief was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, looking no more behind him, he strode off across the maple-grove,
    </p>
    <p>
     through which, now, the first pale stars were glimmering. He reached the
    </p>
    <p>
     road again, swung to the north, and, striking into his long marching
    </p>
    <p>
     stride, pushed onward northward, away and away into the soft June
    </p>
    <p>
     twilight.

     CHAPTER XVI.
    </head>
    <p>
     TIGER WALDRON "COMES BACK."
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Isaac Flint loved but two things in all this world--power, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
     I speak advisedly in putting "power" first. Much as he idolized the
    </p>
    <p>
     girl, much as she reminded him of the long-dead wife of his youth, he
    </p>
    <p>
     could have survived the loss of her. The loss of power would inevitably
    </p>
    <p>
     have crushed and broken him, stunned him, killed him. Yet, so far as
    </p>
    <p>
     human affection could still blossom in that withered heart, shrunk by
    </p>
    <p>
     cold scheming and the cruel piracies of many decades, he loved the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so it was that when the message came in, that evening, over the
    </p>
    <p>
     telephone, the news that Kate had been injured in an auto-accident which
    </p>
    <p>
     had entirely destroyed the machine and killed Herrick, he paled,
    </p>
    <p>
     trembled, and clutched the receiver, hardly able to hold it to his ear
    </p>
    <p>
     with his shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here! You!" he cried. "She--she's not badly hurt? She's living? She's
    </p>
    <p>
     safe? No lies, now! The truth!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your daughter is very much alive, and perfectly safe," a voice
    </p>
    <p>
     answered. "This is Doctor MacDougal, of Haverstraw, speaking. The
    </p>
    <p>
     patient is now having a superficial scalp wound dressed by my assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can speak to her, in a few minutes, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now! For God's sake, let me speak _now_!" entreated the Billionaire;
    </p>
    <p>
     but the doctor refused. Not all Flint's urging or bribing would turn him
    </p>
    <p>
     one hair's breadth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," he insisted. "In ten minutes she can talk to you. Not now. But
    </p>
    <p>
     have no fear, sir. She is perfectly safe and--barring her wound, which
    </p>
    <p>
     will probably heal almost without a scar--is as well as ever. A little
    </p>
    <p>
     nervous and unstrung, of course, but that's to be expected."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What happened, and how?" demanded Flint, in terrible agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The doctor briefly gave him such facts as he knew, ending with the
    </p>
    <p>
     statement that a passing automobilist had brought the girl to him, and
    </p>
    <p>
     outlining the situation of the first-aid measures in the sugar-house. At
    </p>
    <p>
     the thought that Herrick, the drunken cause of it all, was dead and
    </p>
    <p>
     burned, Flint smiled with real satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn him! It's too good for the scum!" he muttered. Then, aloud, he
    </p>
    <p>
     asked over the wire:
    </p>
    <p>
     "And who was the rescuer?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know," MacDougal answered. "Your daughter didn't tell me. But
    </p>
    <p>
     from what I've learned, he must have been a man of rare strength and
    </p>
    <p>
     presence of mind. It may well be that you owe your daughter's life to
    </p>
    <p>
     his prompt work."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll find him, yet. He'll be suitably rewarded," thought the
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire. "No matter what my enemies have called me, I'm not
    </p>
    <p>
     incapable of gratitude!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Some few minutes later, having paced the library floor meanwhile, in
    </p>
    <p>
     great excitement, he called the doctor's house again by long-distance,
    </p>
    <p>
     and this time succeeded in having speech with his daughter. Her voice,
    </p>
    <p>
     though a little weak, vastly reassured him. Once more he asked for the
    </p>
    <p>
     outline of the story. She told him all the essentials, and finished by:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, come and get me, won't you, father dear? I want to go home. And
    </p>
    <p>
     the quicker you come for me, the happier I'll be."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bless your heart, Kate!" he exclaimed, deeply moved. "Nothing like the
    </p>
    <p>
     old man, after all, is there? Yes, I'll start at once. I've only been
    </p>
    <p>
     waiting here, to talk with you and _know_ you're safe. In five minutes
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll be on my way, with the racing-car. And if I don't break a few
    </p>
    <p>
     records between here and Haverstraw, my name's not Isaac Flint!"
    </p>
    <p>
     After an affectionate good-bye, the old man hung up, rang for Slawson,
    </p>
    <p>
     his private valet, and ordered the swiftest car in his garage made ready
    </p>
    <p>
     at once, for a quick run.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two hours later, Doctor MacDougal had pocketed the largest fee he ever
    </p>
    <p>
     had received or ever would, again; and Kate was safe at home, in Idle
    </p>
    <p>
     Hour.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the homeward journey, Flint learned every detail of the affair, from
    </p>
    <p>
     start to finish; and again grimly consigned the soul of the dead
    </p>
    <p>
     chauffeur to the nethermost pits of Hell. Yes, he realized, he must have
    </p>
    <p>
     the body brought in and decently buried, after the coroner's verdict had
    </p>
    <p>
     been rendered; but in his heart he knew that, save for the eye of public
    </p>
    <p>
     opinion and the law, he would let those charred remnants lie and rot
    </p>
    <p>
     there, by the river bank, under the twisted wreckage of the car--and
    </p>
    <p>
     revel in the thought of that last, barbarous revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arrived at home, Flint routed specialists out of their offices, and at a
    </p>
    <p>
     large expense satisfied himself the girl had really taken no serious
    </p>
    <p>
     harm. Next day, and the days following, all that money and science
    </p>
    <p>
     could do to make the gash heal without a scar, was done. Waldron called,
    </p>
    <p>
     greatly unnerved and not at all himself; and Kate received him with
    </p>
    <p>
     amicable interest. She had not yet informed her father of the rupture
    </p>
    <p>
     between Waldron and herself, nor did he suspect it. As for "Tiger," he
    </p>
    <p>
     realized the time was inopportune for any statement of conditions, and
    </p>
    <p>
     held his peace. But once she should be well, again, he had savagely
    </p>
    <p>
     resolved this decision of hers should not stand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn it, it can't! It mustn't!" he reflected, as on the third evening
    </p>
    <p>
     he returned to his Fifth Avenue house. "Now that I'm really in danger of
    </p>
    <p>
     losing her, I'm just beginning to realize what an extraordinary woman
    </p>
    <p>
     she is! As a wife, the mistress of my establishment, a hostess, a social
    </p>
    <p>
     leader, what a figure she would make! And too, the alliance between
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint and myself simply must not be shattered. Kate is the only child.
    </p>
    <p>
     The old man's billion, or more, will surely come to her, practically
    </p>
    <p>
     every penny of it. Flint is more than sixty-three this very minute, he's
    </p>
    <p>
     a dope-fiend, and his heart's damned weak. He's liable to drop off, any
    </p>
    <p>
     moment. If I get Kate, and he dies, what a fortune! What a prize! Added
    </p>
    <p>
     to my interests, it will make me master of the world!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then, too, this new Air Trust scheme positively demands that Flint and
    </p>
    <p>
     I should be bound together by something closer than mere financial
    </p>
    <p>
     association. I've simply got to be one of the family. I've got to be his
    </p>
    <p>
     son-in-law. That's a positive necessity! God, what a fool I was at
    </p>
    <p>
     Longmeadow, to have taken those three drinks, and have been piqued at
    </p>
    <p>
     her beating me--to have let my tongue and temper slip--in short, to have
    </p>
    <p>
     acted like an ass!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ugly and grim, he puffed at his Londres. Vast schemes of finance and of
    </p>
    <p>
     conquest wove through his busy, plotting brain. Visions of the girl
    </p>
    <p>
     arose, too, tempting him still more, though his chill heart was
    </p>
    <p>
     powerless to feel the urge of any real, self-sacrificing or devoted
    </p>
    <p>
     love. Sensual passion he knew, and ambition, and the lust of power;
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing else. But these all opened his eyes to the vast blunder he had
    </p>
    <p>
     committed, and nerved him to reconquest of the ground that he had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can win her, yet," reflected he, as his car swung into the long and
    </p>
    <p>
     brilliant night-vista of Fifth Avenue. "I know women, and I understand
    </p>
    <p>
     the game. Flowers, letters, telephone calls, attention every day--every
    </p>
    <p>
     hour, if need be--these are the artillery to batter down the strongest
    </p>
    <p>
     fortresses of indifference, even of dislike. And she shall have them
    </p>
    <p>
     all--all and more. Wally, old chap, you've never been beaten at any
    </p>
    <p>
     game, whether in the Street or in the pursuit of woman. You'll win yet;
    </p>
    <p>
     you're bound to win! And Kate shall yet open the door to you, toward
    </p>
    <p>
     wealth and power and position such as never yet were seen on earth!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus fortified by his own determination, he slept more calmly that
    </p>
    <p>
     night. And, on the morrow, his campaign began.
    </p>
    <p>
     It lasted but a week.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the end of that time, a friendly little note from Idle Hour told him,
    </p>
    <p>
     frankly and in the kindest manner possible, that--much as she still
    </p>
    <p>
     liked and respected him--Catherine could not, now or ever, think of him
    </p>
    <p>
     in any other way than as a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stunned by this body-blow, "Tiger" first swore with hideous blasphemies
    </p>
    <p>
     that caused his valet to retreat precipitately from the famous,
    </p>
    <p>
     nymph-frieze bedchamber; then ordered drink, then walked the floor a
    </p>
    <p>
     while in a violent passion; and finally knit up his decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By God!" he swore, shaking his fist in the direction of Englewood.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She's balky, eh? She won't, eh? But _I_ say she _will_! And if I can't
    </p>
    <p>
     make her, there's her father, who can. Together we can break this
    </p>
    <p>
     stiff-necked spirit and bring her to time. Hm! Fancy anybody or anything
    </p>
    <p>
     in this world setting up opposition to Flint and Waldron, combined! Just
    </p>
    <p>
     fancy it, that's all!
    </p>
    <p>
     "So then, what's to do? This: See her father and have a heart-to-heart
    </p>
    <p>
     talk with him. It's obvious she hasn't told him, yet, the real state of
    </p>
    <p>
     affairs. I doubt if the old idiot has even noticed the absence of my
    </p>
    <p>
     ring from her finger. And if he has, she's been able to fool him, easily
    </p>
    <p>
     enough. But not much longer, so help me!
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, this very morning he shall hear from me, the whole infernal
    </p>
    <p>
     story--he shall learn his daughter's unreasonable rebellion, the slight
    </p>
    <p>
     she's put upon me and her opposition to his will. _Then_ we shall
    </p>
    <p>
     see--we shall see who's master in that family, he or the girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With this strong determination in his superheated mind, Waldron rang up
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, asked for a private talk, at eleven, in the Wall Street office,
    </p>
    <p>
     and made ready the mustering of his arguments; his self-defense; his
    </p>
    <p>
     appeals to Flint's every sense of interest and liking; his whole plea
    </p>
    <p>
     for the resumption of the broken betrothal.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Catherine, all this time of convalescence--what were her thoughts,
    </p>
    <p>
     and whither were they straying? Not thoughts of Waldron, that is sure,
    </p>
    <p>
     despite his notes, his telephoning, his flowers, his visits. Not to him
    </p>
    <p>
     did they wander, as she sat in her sunny bedroom bay-window, looking
    </p>
    <p>
     out over the great, close cropped lawn, through the oaks and elms, to
    </p>
    <p>
     the Palisades and the sparkling Hudson beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, not to Waldron. Yet wander they did, despite her; and with
    </p>
    <p>
     persistence they followed channels till then quite unknown to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     What might these channels be? And whither, I ask again, did the girl's
    </p>
    <p>
     memories and fancies, her wondering thoughts, her vague, half-formulated
    </p>
    <p>
     longings, lead?
    </p>
    <p>
     You, perhaps, can answer, as well as I, if you but remember
    </p>
    <p>
     that--Billionaire's daughter though she was, and all unversed in the
    </p>
    <p>
     hard realities of life--she was, at heart and soul, very much a woman
    </p>
    <p>
     after all.

    <p>
     THOUGHTS.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the long days, the June days, of her convalescence, Catherine
    </p>
    <p>
     found herself involuntarily reverting, more often than she could
    </p>
    <p>
     understand, to thoughts of the inscrutable and unknown man who had in
    </p>
    <p>
     all probability saved her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Had it not been for him," she reflected, as she sat there gazing out
    </p>
    <p>
     over the river, "I might not be here, this minute. Caught as I was, on
    </p>
    <p>
     the very brink of the precipice, I should almost certainly have slipped
    </p>
    <p>
     and fallen over, in my dazed condition, when I tried to get up. If I'd
    </p>
    <p>
     been alone, if he hadn't found me just when he did--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She shuddered at thought of what must almost inevitably have happened,
    </p>
    <p>
     and covered her face with both hands. Her cheeks burned; she knew
    </p>
    <p>
     emotion such as not once had Waldron's kiss ever been able to arouse in
    </p>
    <p>
     her. The memory of how she, half-unconscious, had lain in that
    </p>
    <p>
     stranger's arms, so powerful and tense; had been carried by him, as
    </p>
    <p>
     though she had been a child; had felt his breath upon her face and the
    </p>
    <p>
     quick, vigorous beating of his heart--all this, and more, dwelt in her
    </p>
    <p>
     soul, nor could she banish it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gratitude? Yes, and more. For the first time in her two-and-twenty
    </p>
    <p>
     years, Catherine had sensed the power, the virility of a real man--not
    </p>
    <p>
     of the make-believe, manicured and tailored parasites of her own
    </p>
    <p>
     class--and something elemental in her, some urge of primitive womanhood,
    </p>
    <p>
     grappled her to that memory and, all against her will, caused her to
    </p>
    <p>
     live and re-live those moments, time and time again, as the most strange
    </p>
    <p>
     and vital of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, it was not this physical call alone, in her, that had awakened her
    </p>
    <p>
     being. The man's eyes, and mouth and hair, true, all remained with her
    </p>
    <p>
     as a subtly compelling lure; his strength and straight directness seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to conquer her and draw her to him; but beyond all this, something in
    </p>
    <p>
     his speech, in his ideas and the strange reticence that had so puzzled
    </p>
    <p>
     her, kept him even more constantly in her wondering thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A workingman," she murmured to herself, in uncomprehending revery, "he
    </p>
    <p>
     said he was a workingman--and he knew that I was very, very rich. He
    </p>
    <p>
     knew my father would have rewarded him magnificently, given him money,
    </p>
    <p>
     work, anything he might have asked. And yet, and yet--he would not even
    </p>
    <p>
     tell his name. And he refused to know mine! He didn't want to know! His
    </p>
    <p>
     pride--why, in all my life, among all the proud, rich people that I've
    </p>
    <p>
     known, I've never found such pride as that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She reflected what would have happened had any man of the usual type
    </p>
    <p>
     rescued her, even a man of wealth and position. Of course, thought she,
    </p>
    <p>
     that man would have made himself known and would have called on her,
    </p>
    <p>
     ostensibly to inquire after her condition, yet really to ingratiate
    </p>
    <p>
     himself. At this reflection she shuddered again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ugh!" she whispered. "He'd have tried to take liberties, any other man
    </p>
    <p>
     would. He'd have presumed on the accident--he'd have been--oh,
    </p>
    <p>
     everything that _that_ man was not, and could never be!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Now her thoughts wandered to the brief talk they two had had there in
    </p>
    <p>
     the old sugar-house. Every word of it seemed graven on her memory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Disconnected bits of what he had told her, seemed to float before her
    </p>
    <p>
     mental vision--: "I? Oh, I'm just an out-of-work--don't ask me who I am;
    </p>
    <p>
     and I won't ask who _you_ are. We're of different worlds, I guess--don't
    </p>
    <p>
     question me; I'd rather you wouldn't. Am I happy? Yes, in a way, or
    </p>
    <p>
     shall be, when I've done what I mean to do!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Such were some of his phrases that kept coming back to her, as she sat
    </p>
    <p>
     there in that luxurious and beautiful room, her book lying unread in her
    </p>
    <p>
     lap, the scent of flowers everywhere, and, merely for her taking, all
    </p>
    <p>
     the world's treasures hers to command. Strange man, indeed, and stranger
    </p>
    <p>
     speech, to her! Never had she been thus spoken to. His every word and
    </p>
    <p>
     thought and point of view, commonplace enough, perhaps, seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiarly stimulating to her, and wakened eager curiosity, and would
    </p>
    <p>
     not let her live in peace, as heretofore.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He said he was a Socialist, too," she murmured, "whatever that may be.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he--he didn't _look_ it! On the contrary, he looked remarkably clean
    </p>
    <p>
     and intelligent. And the words he used were the words of an educated
    </p>
    <p>
     man. Far better vocabulary than Waldron's, for example; and as for poor
    </p>
    <p>
     little Van Slyke, and that set, why this man's mind seems to have
    </p>
    <p>
     towered above them as the Palisades tower above the river!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Happy? Rich? He said he was both--and all he had was eighteen dollars
    </p>
    <p>
     and his two big hands! Just fancy that, will you? He might as well have
    </p>
    <p>
     said eighteen cents; it would have been about as much! And I--what did
    </p>
    <p>
     I tell him? I told him I, with all my money and everything, was vacant,
    </p>
    <p>
     empty, futile! Just those words. And--God help me, I--I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, she felt her eyes were wet. What was the reason? Herself she
    </p>
    <p>
     knew not. All she knew was that with her beautiful and queenly head
    </p>
    <p>
     bowed on the arm of her Japanese silk morning gown, as its loose sleeves
    </p>
    <p>
     lay along the edge of the Chippendale table, she was crying like a
    </p>
    <p>
     child.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crying bitterly; and yet in a kind of new, strange joy. Crying with
    </p>
    <p>
     tears so bitter-sweet that she, herself, could not half understand them;
    </p>
    <p>
     could not fathom the deeper meaning that lay hidden there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If!" she whispered to her heart. "If only I were of his class, or he of
    </p>
    <p>
     mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
     And Gabriel, what of him?
    </p>
    <p>
     As he swung north and westward, day by day, on the long hike toward
    </p>
    <p>
     Niagara, the memory of the girl went with him, and hour by hour bore him
    </p>
    <p>
     company.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was not forgetting. Could he forget? Strive as he might, to thrust
    </p>
    <p>
     her out of his heart and soul, she still indwelt there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not all his philosophy, nor all his realization that this woman he had
    </p>
    <p>
     saved, this woman who had lain in his two arms and mingled her breath
    </p>
    <p>
     with his, belonged to another and an alien class, could banish her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as he strode along, swinging his knotted stick at the daisies and
    </p>
    <p>
     pondering on all that might have been and now could never be, a sudden,
    </p>
    <p>
     passionate longing burst over him, as a long sea-roller, hurled against
    </p>
    <p>
     a cliff, flings upward in vast tourbillions of spume.
    </p>
    <p>
     Raising his face to the summer sky, his bare head high with emotion and
    </p>
    <p>
     his eyes wide with the thought of strange possibilities that shook and
    </p>
    <p>
     intoxicated him, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh--would God she were an orphan and an outcast! Would God she had no
    </p>
    <p>
     penny in this world to call her own!"

     CHAPTER XVIII.
    </head>
    <p>
     FLINT AND WALDRON PLAN.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tiger" Waldron's interview with old man Flint, regarding Catherine's
    </p>
    <p>
     breaking of the engagement, was particularly electric. Promptly at the
    </p>
    <p>
     appointed hour, Waldron appeared, shook hands with the older man, sat
    </p>
    <p>
     down and lighted a cigar, then proceeded to business.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Flint," said he, without any ado, "I've come here to tell you some very
    </p>
    <p>
     unpleasant news and to ask your help. Can you stand the one, and give me
    </p>
    <p>
     the other?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The Billionaire looked at him through his pince-nez, poised on that
    </p>
    <p>
     vulture-beak, with some astonishment. Then he smiled nervously, showing
    </p>
    <p>
     his gleaming tooth of gold, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I guess so. What's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's wrong? Everything! Catherine has broken our engagement!"
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment old Flint sat there motionless and staring. Then, moving
    </p>
    <p>
     his head forward with a peculiar, pecking twitch that still further
    </p>
    <p>
     enhanced his likeness to a buzzard, he stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
     "You--you mean--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean just what I say. Your daughter has severed the betrothal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Haven't you noticed my ring was gone from her finger?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gone? Bless my soul, no--that is, yes--maybe. I don't know. But--but
    </p>
    <p>
     at any rate, I thought nothing of it. So then, you say--she's broken it
    </p>
    <p>
     off? But, why? And when? And--and tell me, Wally, what's it all about?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Listen, and I _will_ tell you," Tiger answered. "And I'll give it to
    </p>
    <p>
     you straight. I'm partly at fault. Mostly so, it may be. Let me assume
    </p>
    <p>
     all the blame, at any rate. I'm not sparing myself and have no intention
    </p>
    <p>
     of doing so. My conduct, I admit, was beastly. No excuses offered. All I
    </p>
    <p>
     want to do, now, is to make the _amende honorable_, be forgiven, and
    </p>
    <p>
     have the former status resumed."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus spoke Waldron. But all the time his soul lay hot within him, at
    </p>
    <p>
     having so to humble himself before Flint; at being thus obliged to eat
    </p>
    <p>
     crow, and fawn and feign and creep.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If I didn't need your billion, old man," his secret thought was, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     eyed Flint with pretended humility, "you might go to Hell, for all of
    </p>
    <p>
     me--you and your daughter with you, damn you both!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The Billionaire sat blinking, for a moment. Then, picking up a pencil
    </p>
    <p>
     and idly scrawling pothooks on the big clean sheet of blotting-paper
    </p>
    <p>
     that covered his reference-book table, beside which the men were
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, what's the trouble all about? What are the facts? I must have
    </p>
    <p>
     those, in full, before I can guarantee to do anything toward changing my
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter's opinion. Much as I deplore her action, Wally, I don't know
    </p>
    <p>
     whether she's right or wrong, till you tell me. Now, let's have it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will," the other answered; and he was as good as his word. Realizing
    </p>
    <p>
     the prime futility of any subterfuge, or any misstatement of
    </p>
    <p>
     fact--which Catherine would surely discover and tell her father, and
    </p>
    <p>
     which would react against him--Waldron began at the beginning and
    </p>
    <p>
     narrated the entire affair, with every detail precisely accurate. Nay,
    </p>
    <p>
     he even exaggerated the offensiveness of his conduct, at the Longmeadow
    </p>
    <p>
     Club, and in various ways gave the Billionaire to understand that he was
    </p>
    <p>
     a more serious offender than in truth he really was. For, after all, the
    </p>
    <p>
     only real offense was the lack of any compatibility between the girl and
    </p>
    <p>
     himself--the total absence of love.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint listened carefully and with a judicial expression. If he blamed
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, he made no statement of that fact. A man himself, and one who
    </p>
    <p>
     viewed man's weaknesses and woman's foibles with a cynic eye, he could
    </p>
    <p>
     judge motives and weigh actions with considerable skill.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I see, I see," he commented, when Waldron had quite done, and had
    </p>
    <p>
     poured forth a highly false declaration of his great love for the girl
    </p>
    <p>
     and his determination that this rupture should not be permanent. "I
    </p>
    <p>
     understand the case, I think. It all seems an unfortunate accident--just
    </p>
    <p>
     one of those unavoidable incidents which strike into and upset human
    </p>
    <p>
     calculations, against all expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're not terribly guilty, Waldron. You acted inconsiderably.
    </p>
    <p>
     Irritatingly, perhaps, and not wholly like a gentleman--for which, blame
    </p>
    <p>
     the rotten Scotch they _will_ persist in selling, out there at
    </p>
    <p>
     Longmeadow. But even that's not fatal. Many men have done worse and been
    </p>
    <p>
     forgiven. I'll have a talk with Catherine, inside a day or two, when the
    </p>
    <p>
     psychological moment offers. And you may be sure, if a father's advice
    </p>
    <p>
     and good offices are of any avail, this little quarrel will be all
    </p>
    <p>
     patched up between you two. Surely will be! I can almost positively
    </p>
    <p>
     promise you that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Promise it?" asked Waldron, leaning eagerly forward, a strange light in
    </p>
    <p>
     those close-set, greenish eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint nodded. "Yes," he answered. "I've never yet failed to bring Kate
    </p>
    <p>
     to reason and good common-sense, when I've set out to. This will be no
    </p>
    <p>
     exception. My word and my counsel possess the greatest weight with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'll listen and be advised, I'm sure. So have no uneasiness," he
    </p>
    <p>
     concluded, holding out his hand to his partner. "Leave everything to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     You'll see, it will all come right, in the end."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tiger" shook his hand, cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I haven't words to thank you!" he exclaimed, with as much emotion as he
    </p>
    <p>
     could simulate from a perfectly cold heart and calculating soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't try to," the Billionaire replied, with seeming benevolence. "All
    </p>
    <p>
     the thanks I want, Wally, is to patch up this little difficulty and
    </p>
    <p>
     reunite two--that is--two loving, sympathetic hearts!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You old hypocrite!" Waldron thought, eyeing him. "All _you_ want of me,
    </p>
    <p>
     if anything, is to keep me as your partner, because you know you're
    </p>
    <p>
     growing old and losing your grip, and I'm still in the game with all
    </p>
    <p>
     four claws! Paternal philanthropist _you_ are--I don't think!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Wally was dead right.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can't lose this man," the Billionaire was thinking. "Whether or no,
    </p>
    <p>
     Kate has got to marry him. This Air Trust business demands a strong, a
    </p>
    <p>
     quick, a perfectly unscrupulous hand. And no outsider will do. My
    </p>
    <p>
     partner has got to be my son-in-law. Love be damned! Romantic slush can
    </p>
    <p>
     go to Hell! Kate will marry him--she's _got_ to--or I'll know the reason
    </p>
    <p>
     why!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Though, after all," he soothed his conscience, as Waldron stood up,
    </p>
    <p>
     walked to the window and stood gazing out as he smoked, "after all,
    </p>
    <p>
     Wally will make her as happy, I fancy, as any man. He's a fine figure in
    </p>
    <p>
     the world, commanding, heavily propertied, energetic and successful,
    </p>
    <p>
     also of the finest family connections. Yes, a husband any woman might
    </p>
    <p>
     admire and be proud of. Certainly, the only son-in-law for _me_. Even if
    </p>
    <p>
     she can't idolize and worship him, as some fool women think they must, a
    </p>
    <p>
     man, she can respect and be respected with him. And with him she can
    </p>
    <p>
     take the highest position in the land, without a qualm as to his
    </p>
    <p>
     competence and manner. Beside all that, what's love? Love? Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With which philosophy, he too arose, went back into his own office, and
    </p>
    <p>
     returned to the dictating of some very private letters to Slade, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Cosmos Detective Agency manager, _in re_ the ferreting-out and jailing
    </p>
    <p>
     or deporting of all Socialists and labor leaders at Niagara. This
    </p>
    <p>
     preparatory work on the ground of the huge new Air Trust plant, he
    </p>
    <p>
     deemed most essential. The Cosmos people, scenting a big contract, had
    </p>
    <p>
     fostered his belief, and now, already, the work was well under way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Subterranean methods were still sufficing; but, should these fail,
    </p>
    <p>
     others lay in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint smiled a grim, vulturine smile as he read over the finished
    </p>
    <p>
     letters of instruction, a few minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And to think," he mused, as he finished them, "that these fanatics
    </p>
    <p>
     believe--really believe--they can make headway anywhere in this country,
    </p>
    <p>
     now! Ten years ago, yes, they might have. But that's not today. Then,
    </p>
    <p>
     publie opinion--stupid and futile as it was--could still be aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, there was a really effective labor and Socialist press. And the
    </p>
    <p>
     Limited Franchise Bill hadn't gone through. Neither had the enlarged
    </p>
    <p>
     Military Bill, the National Censorship nor even the Grays--the National
    </p>
    <p>
     Mounted Police. While _now_--ah, thank Heaven, it's all so different and
    </p>
    <p>
     so easy that I call myself a fool, at times, for even giving these
    </p>
    <p>
     matters a single thought!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," he concluded, handing the letters back to his confidential
    </p>
    <p>
     secretary, for mailing, "well, now _that's_ done, at any rate. So then,
    </p>
    <p>
     to the S.&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;S. committee meeting. And tonight my little
    </p>
    <p>
     talk with Kate. I'll soon bring her to reason, I'm sure. There's nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     can't be accomplished by a little patience and persuasion."
    </p>
    <p>
     The old Billionaire chose his time well, that night, for the vital
    </p>
    <p>
     interview with his daughter, who had so far rebelled against his
    </p>
    <p>
     authority as to break with the man most eminently acceptable to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a simple but exquisite dinner in the Venetian room, he asked the
    </p>
    <p>
     girl to play for him, which (he knew) always pleased her and put her in
    </p>
    <p>
     a receptive mood.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Play for you, father?" she answered. "Of course I will, anything and as
    </p>
    <p>
     much as you like! What shall it be, tonight? Chopin, or Grieg, or--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anything that pleases you, suits me, my dear," he answered, smiling
    </p>
    <p>
     with satisfaction at his ruse. Never had he felt more masterful. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed himself a trifle more morphia than usual that day, by reason of
    </p>
    <p>
     the approaching interview; and now the subtle drug filled him with
    </p>
    <p>
     well-being and seemed to enhance his self-control and power. Lighting a
    </p>
    <p>
     cigar--rare treat for him--he offered Kate his arm; and together,
    </p>
    <p>
     unattended by any valet or domestic, they walked along the high,
    </p>
    <p>
     paneled hallway, hung with Gobelin tapestries, and so reached the
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificent music-room which Kate claimed, in a way, as her own special
    </p>
    <p>
     place at Idle Hour.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here everything suggested harmony. The mahogany wainscotted walls were
    </p>
    <p>
     decked with fine portraits of the world's great masters of melody.
    </p>
    <p>
     Handsome cabinets contained costly and elaborate collections and folios
    </p>
    <p>
     of music, a complete library of the entire world's best productions. The
    </p>
    <p>
     girl's harp--a masterpiece by Pestalozzi of Venice--stood at one side;
    </p>
    <p>
     on the other, a five hundred dollar Victrola, with a wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     repertoire of records. But the grand piano itself dominated all,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially made for Catherine by Durand FrÃ¨res, in Paris, and imported
    </p>
    <p>
     on the Billionaire's own yacht, the "Bandit." A wondrous instrument,
    </p>
    <p>
     this, finer even than the pipe-organ in an alcove at the far end of the
    </p>
    <p>
     room. It summed up all that the world's masters knew of
    </p>
    <p>
     instrument-production; and its cost, from factory to its present place
    </p>
    <p>
     at Idle Hour, represented twenty years' wages, and more, of any of
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint's slaves in the West Virginia mines or the Glenn Pool oil-fields
    </p>
    <p>
     of Oklahoma.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this magnificent piano the girl now seated herself, on a bench of
    </p>
    <p>
     polished teak, from Mindanao. And, turning to her father, who had sunk
    </p>
    <p>
     down in his favorite easy-chair of Russia leather, she asked with a
    </p>
    <p>
     smile:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, daddy, what shall I play for you, to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked at her a minute, before replying. Never had she seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     dear, so beautiful to him. The rose-tinted light that fell softly from a
    </p>
    <p>
     Bohemian chandelier over her head, flooded her coiled hair, her face,
    </p>
    <p>
     her hands, with soft warm color. The slight dressing that her wound now
    </p>
    <p>
     required was covered by a deft arrangement of her hair. She had regained
    </p>
    <p>
     her usual tint. Nothing now told of the accident, the close call she had
    </p>
    <p>
     had, from death, so short a time before. And old Flint smiled, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     answered her:
    </p>
    <p>
     "What shall you play? Anything you like, my dear. You know best--only,
    </p>
    <p>
     don't make it too classical. Your old father isn't up to that ultra
    </p>
    <p>
     music, you know, and never will be!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiled again with understanding, and turned to the keyboard. Then,
    </p>
    <p>
     without notes, and with a delicate touch of perfectly modulated
    </p>
    <p>
     interpretation, she began to render "TraÃ¼merei," as though she, too, had
    </p>
    <p>
     been dreaming of something that might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint listened, with perfect content. The music soothed and quieted him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the foreknowledge of the difficult task that lay before him, the
    </p>
    <p>
     interview that he must have with his daughter, faded from his mind, a
    </p>
    <p>
     little, and left him wholly calm. Eyes closed, every sense intent on the
    </p>
    <p>
     delicious harmony, he followed the masterpiece to the end; and sighed
    </p>
    <p>
     when the last notes had died away, and kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Kate, still needing no music on the rack before her, played the
    </p>
    <p>
     "Miserere" from "Il Trovatore," a Hungarian "Czardas," Mendelssohn's
    </p>
    <p>
     "FrÃ¼hlingslied" and the overture from "William Tell." She followed these
    </p>
    <p>
     with the "Intermezzo" and the "Pizzicato" from "Sylvia," and then with
    </p>
    <p>
     "Narcissus" and "Sans Souci." And at the end of this, she paused again;
    </p>
    <p>
     for now her father had arisen and come close to her. With a hand on her
    </p>
    <p>
     shoulder, looking down at her with stern yet kindly eyes, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Sans Souci'? That means 'Without Care,' doesn't it, Kate?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, Daddy. Why?" she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I was just thinking, that's all," said he. "It made me wish _I_ had
    </p>
    <p>
     no cares, no troubles, no sorrows."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorrows, father? Why should you have sorrows?" she queried, turning to
    </p>
    <p>
     him and taking both his shriveled hands in her warm, strong ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorrows? Why shouldn't I?" said he. "Every man of large affairs has
    </p>
    <p>
     them. Every father has them, too." And he bent over her and kissed her,
    </p>
    <p>
     with unusual emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Every father?" asked she. "What do you mean? Am _I_ a sorrow to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "A joy in many ways," he answered. "In some, a sorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     "In what ways?" she asked quickly, her eyes widening.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In this way, most of all," he told her, as he took her left hand up,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pointed at the finger where Waldron's ring had been and now no
    </p>
    <p>
     longer was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at him a moment, hardly understanding; then bowed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Father," she whispered. "Forgive me--but I couldn't! I--I couldn't! No,
    </p>
    <p>
     not for the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint's drug-contracted eyes hardened as he stood there gazing down at
    </p>
    <p>
     her. Once, twice he essayed to speak, but found no words. At last,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, blinking nervously, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     "This, Kate, is what I want to talk with you about, to-night. Will you
    </p>
    <p>
     hear me?"
    </p>

    <p>
     CATHERINE'S DEFIANCE.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hear you, best and dearest father in the world?" she cried, looking
    </p>
    <p>
     quickly up at him again. "Of course I will! Only, I beg you,
    </p>
    <p>
     don't--don't ask me to--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will ask you nothing, Kate, my girl, save this--to consider
    </p>
    <p>
     everything well, and to act like a reasoning, thinking creature, not
    </p>
    <p>
     like an impetuous and romantic school-girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Releasing her hands, he once more sat down in the easy-chair, crossed
    </p>
    <p>
     his legs and peered keenly at her, to fathom if he could the inner
    </p>
    <p>
     workings of that other brain and heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, father," she said, "I'll admit, right away, that I've done wrong
    </p>
    <p>
     to keep this from you, or to try to. We--I--broke the engagement, that
    </p>
    <p>
     day of the accident, out at Longmeadow. I _meant_ to tell you, tell you
    </p>
    <p>
     everything and explain it all, but somehow--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You needn't explain, my dear," said Flint, judicially. "Wally has
    </p>
    <p>
     already done so."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And does he blame me, father?" cried the girl, eagerly, clasping her
    </p>
    <p>
     hands on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, not at all. On the contrary, he claims the fault is all his own.
    </p>
    <p>
     And he's most contrite and repentant, Kate. Absolutely so. All he asks
    </p>
    <p>
     in the world is to make amends and--well, resume the old relation,
    </p>
    <p>
     whenever you are willing."
    </p>
    <p>
     Kate shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's noble and big of him, father," said she, "to assume all the
    </p>
    <p>
     blame. Really, half of it is mine. But he's acted like a true man, in
    </p>
    <p>
     taking it. However, that can't change my decision. I want him for a
    </p>
    <p>
     friend, in every way. But for a husband, no, no, never in this world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The Billionaire frowned darkly. Already a stronger opposition was
    </p>
    <p>
     developing than he had expected; and opposition was the one thing in all
    </p>
    <p>
     the world that he could neither tolerate nor endure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Listen, Kate," said he. "You don't grasp the situation at all. Waldron
    </p>
    <p>
     is an extraordinary man in many ways. In refusing him, you seriously
    </p>
    <p>
     injure yourself. Of course, he has never done any spectacular, heroic
    </p>
    <p>
     thing for you, like--for instance--that young man who rescued you, and
    </p>
    <p>
     whom I shall suitably reward as soon as I find him--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What!" she exclaimed, peering eagerly at her father. "What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
     Find him? Reward him?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eh? Why, naturally," the Billionaire replied, scowling at the
    </p>
    <p>
     interruption. "His game of refusing his identity was, of course, just a
    </p>
    <p>
     clever dodge on his part. He certainly must expect something out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have--er--set certain forces at work to discover him; and, as I say,
    </p>
    <p>
     when I've done so, I will reward him liberally, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You'd better _not_!" ejaculated Kate, with animation. "He isn't the
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of man you can take liberties with!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm? What now?" said Flint, with vexation. "What do _you_ know about
    </p>
    <p>
     him?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, nothing, nothing, father," the girl answered quickly. "Only, I
    </p>
    <p>
     think you're making a mistake to try and force a reward on a man who
    </p>
    <p>
     doesn't want it. But no matter," she added, her face tinged by a warmer
    </p>
    <p>
     glow--which Flint was quick to see. "Forgive my interruption. Now, about
    </p>
    <p>
     Wally?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The old man peered intently at his daughter, a full minute, then with a
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiar sinking at his heart, made shift to say:
    </p>
    <p>
     "About Wally, yes; you simply don't understand. That's all. Listen now,
    </p>
    <p>
     Kate, and be reasonable."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will, daddy. Only don't ask me to marry a man I don't and can't love,
    </p>
    <p>
     ever, ever, so long as I live!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That isn't anything, my girl. Love isn't all."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is, to _me_! Without it, marriage is only--" She shuddered. "No,
    </p>
    <p>
     daddy; a thousand times better for me to be an old maid, and--and all
    </p>
    <p>
     that, than give myself to _him_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint set his teeth hard together.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Kate," said he, his voice like wire, "now hear what I have to say! I
    </p>
    <p>
     want you fully to understand the character and desirability of Maxim
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then in a cold, analytic voice, carefully, point by point, he analyzed
    </p>
    <p>
     the suitor, told of his wealth and power, his connections and his
    </p>
    <p>
     prospects, his culture, travel, political influence and world-wide
    </p>
    <p>
     reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Furthermore," he added, while Kate listened with an expression as cold
    </p>
    <p>
     as her father's tone itself, "he is my partner. We are allied, in
    </p>
    <p>
     business. I hope we may be, too, in family. This man is one that any
    </p>
    <p>
     woman in the world might be proud to call her husband--proud, and glad!
    </p>
    <p>
     Love flies away, in a few brief months or years. Wealth and power and
    </p>
    <p>
     respect remain. And, with these, love too may come. Be strong, Kate! Be
    </p>
    <p>
     sensible! You are no child, but a grown woman. I shall not try to force
    </p>
    <p>
     you. All I want to do is show you your own best interest. Think this all
    </p>
    <p>
     over. Sleep on it. Tomorrow, let us talk of it again. For your own sake,
    </p>
    <p>
     and mine, do as you should, and let folly be averted. Renew the
    </p>
    <p>
     engagement. Hush the breath of gossip and scandal. Conform. Play the
    </p>
    <p>
     game! Do right--be strong!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She only shook her head; and now he saw the glister of tear-drops in
    </p>
    <p>
     those beautiful gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Father," cried she, standing up and holding out both hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have mercy on me! I can't--I can't! My heart refuses and I cannot force
    </p>
    <p>
     it. All this--what is it to me?" She swept her hand at the glowing
    </p>
    <p>
     luxury around her. "Without love, what would such another home be to me?
    </p>
    <p>
     Worse than a prison-cell, I swear! A living death, to one like me!
    </p>
    <p>
     Barter and sale--cold calculation--oh, horrible prostitution, horrible,
    </p>
    <p>
     unspeakable!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Poverty, with love--yes, I would choose it. Without love, I never,
    </p>
    <p>
     never can give myself! Never, as long as I live!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The Billionaire, too, stood up. He was shaking, now, as in a palsy,
    </p>
    <p>
     striving to control his rage. His fingers twitched spasmodically, and
    </p>
    <p>
     his eyes burned like firecoals behind those gleaming lenses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as he peered at her, he suddenly went even paler than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through his heart a stab of understanding had all at once gone home. The
    </p>
    <p>
     veils were lifted, and he knew the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her manner in speaking of that unknown, wandering rescuer; the blush
    </p>
    <p>
     that had burned from breast to brow, when he had mentioned the fellow;
    </p>
    <p>
     her aversion for Waldron and her reticence in talking of the
    </p>
    <p>
     accident--all this, and more, now surged on Flint's comprehension,
    </p>
    <p>
     flooding his mind with light--with light and with terrible anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, losing all control, he took a step or two, and raised his shaking
    </p>
    <p>
     hand. His big-knuckled finger, shaken in denunciation, was raised almost
    </p>
    <p>
     in her face. Choking, stammering, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah! Now I know! Now, now I understand you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Terrified, she retreated toward the door of the music-room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Father, father! What makes you look so?" she gasped. "Oh, you have
    </p>
    <p>
     never looked or spoken to me this way! What--what can it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What can it be?" he mouthed at her. "You ask me, you hypocrite, when
    </p>
    <p>
     you well know?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly she faced him, stiffening into pride and hard rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No more of that, father!" she exclaimed, her eyes blazing. "I am your
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter, but you can't talk to me thus. You must not!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who--who are _you_ to say 'must not?'" he gibed, now wholly beside
    </p>
    <p>
     himself. "You--you, who love a vagabond, a tramp, scum and off-scouring
    </p>
    <p>
     of the gutter?"
    </p>
    <p>
     A strange, half-choking sound was his only answer. Then, with no word,
    </p>
    <p>
     she turned away from him, biting her lip lest she answer and betray
    </p>
    <p>
     herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go!" he commanded, bloodless and quivering. "Go to your room. No more
    </p>
    <p>
     of this! We shall see, soon, who's master of this house!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She was already gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Flint stood there a moment, listening to her retreating footfalls on
    </p>
    <p>
     the parquetry of the vast hall. Then, as these died he turned and
    </p>
    <p>
     groped his way, as though blind, back to his chair, and fell in it, and
    </p>
    <p>
     covered his eyes with both his shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a long time he sat there, anguished and crucified amid all that
    </p>
    <p>
     unmeaning luxury and splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last he rose and with uncertain steps sought his own suite,
    </p>
    <p>
     above-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billionaire and world-master though he was, that night he knew his heart
    </p>
    <p>
     lay dead within him. He realized that all the fruits of life were Dead
    </p>
    <p>
     Sea fruits, withered to dust and ashes on his pale and quivering lips.

    <p>
     THE BILLIONAIRE'S PLOT.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was aroused from this bitter revery by a rapping at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Opening, he admitted Slawson, his valet. The servile one handed him a
    </p>
    <p>
     letter with a special-delivery stamp on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Excuse me for intruding, sir," said Slawson, meekly smiling, "but I
    </p>
    <p>
     knew this was urgent."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right. Get out!" growled Flint. When the man was gone, he fortified
    </p>
    <p>
     himself with a couple of morphine tablets, and ripped the long envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was from Slade, he knew, of the Cosmos Agency.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a rapid eye he glanced it over. Then uttering a sudden oath, he
    </p>
    <p>
     studied it carefully, under the electric bulb beside his dressing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gods and devils!" he ejaculated. "What next?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The letter read:
    </p>
    <p>
     142A Park Row, New York City, June 28, 1921.
    </p>
    <p>
     Isaac L. Flint, Esq.,
    </p>
    <p>
     Idle Hour, Englewood, N. J.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
     Reporting in the matter of the young man who rescued your
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter, in the recent accident, let me say I have discovered his
    </p>
    <p>
     identity and some important facts concerning him. I take the
    </p>
    <p>
     liberty of thinking that your intention of rewarding him, when
    </p>
    <p>
     found, will be somewhat modified by this information.
    </p>
    <p>
     This man's name is Gabriel Armstrong, age 24. Occupation, expert
    </p>
    <p>
     electrical and chemical worker. A Socialist and labor agitator, of
    </p>
    <p>
     the most dangerous type, because intellectual and well-read. A man
    </p>
    <p>
     of considerable power and influence in Socialist and labor
    </p>
    <p>
     circles. Has been something of a wanderer. Is well known to union
    </p>
    <p>
     men and Socialists, all over the country. A powerful speaker, and
    </p>
    <p>
     resourceful.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was last employed at your testing-works on Staten Island.
    </p>
    <p>
     Discharged by your Mr. Herzog, about two weeks ago for having, I
    </p>
    <p>
     understand, been in possession of a certain red-covered note-book,
    </p>
    <p>
     which Mr. Herzog found in his pocket. This book is the same which
    </p>
    <p>
     you commissioned me to find, but which Mr. Herzog returned to you
    </p>
    <p>
     before I undertook the search for it. The inference is that this
    </p>
    <p>
     Armstrong is in possession of some private information about your
    </p>
    <p>
     work, which may make him even more dangerous. Herzog informs me
    </p>
    <p>
     that you and Mr. Waldron have had Armstrong blacklisted. But this
    </p>
    <p>
     seems of no importance to the man, as he is clever and can live
    </p>
    <p>
     anywhere, by casual labor and by working with the Socialists.
    </p>
    <p>
     Armstrong is now at Syracuse. He has been tramping the roads. Have
    </p>
    <p>
     had two of my operators enter his room at the Excelsior Lodging
    </p>
    <p>
     House and search, his effects, while he was taking a bath. Can find
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing to give me any legal means of proceeding against him. He
    </p>
    <p>
     has some ready money, so a vagrancy-charge will not hold. If you
    </p>
    <p>
     wish me to resort to extreme measures to "get" him, kindly give me
    </p>
    <p>
     carte blanche, and guarantee me protection in case of trouble. The
    </p>
    <p>
     job can be done, but it may be risky, in view of his influence and
    </p>
    <p>
     backing among the Socialists and labor people. Before proceeding
    </p>
    <p>
     further I want to know how far you will support me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Am having him shadowed. He cannot get away. As yet he suspects
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing. On receipt of your next, will take measures to put him
    </p>
    <p>
     away for a few months. I know that, once he lands behind bars, his
    </p>
    <p>
     finish can be easily arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Trusting this information will prove satisfactory to you, and
    </p>
    <p>
     awaiting your further instructions, I am,
    </p>
    <p>
     Very truly yours,
    </p>
    <p>
     THE COSMOS AGENCY,
    </p>
    <p>
     Dillon F. Slade, Mgr.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Flint read this extraordinary communication twice through, then,
    </p>
    <p>
     raising his head, growled in his shrunken throat, for all the world like
    </p>
    <p>
     a wild beast. His gold tooth, gleaming in the light, made his rictus of
    </p>
    <p>
     passion more venomous, more malevolent still.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The--the Hell-hound!" he stammered, his eyes narrowed with hate and
    </p>
    <p>
     rage. "Oh, wait! Wait till we land him! And this--_this_ is the devil,
    </p>
    <p>
     the scum, that Kate, my daughter--"
    </p>
    <p>
     He could not finish; but, clutching at his sparse gray hair, fell to
    </p>
    <p>
     pacing the floor and mouthing execrations. Had he been of the sanguine
    </p>
    <p>
     manner of body, he must inevitably have suffered an apoplexy. Only his
    </p>
    <p>
     spare frame and bloodless type, due to the drug, saved his life, at that
    </p>
    <p>
     first shock of rage and hate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grown calmer, presently, he took quick action. Seating himself at a desk
    </p>
    <p>
     in the corner of his bed-chamber--a desk where some of his most
    </p>
    <p>
     important private matters had been put through--he chose a sheet of
    </p>
    <p>
     blank paper, with no monogram, and wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
     Take immediate action. Will back you to the limit, and beyond. Ten
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand bonus if you land him behind bars inside a week. Stop at
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing, but get results. F.
    </p>
    <p>
     This he folded and put in an envelope which he addressed to Slade, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was about to seal, when another idea struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By God!" he exclaimed, smiting the desk. "It won't do to have this just
    </p>
    <p>
     some ordinary charge. The thing has got to be disgraceful, unpardonable,
    </p>
    <p>
     hideous!
    </p>
    <p>
     "There are two things to be considered now. One is to 'get' him, in
    </p>
    <p>
     connection with that red book of my plans--to head him off from making
    </p>
    <p>
     any possible trouble in the development of the Air Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The other is--Kate! Nothing catches a woman, like martyrdom. If
    </p>
    <p>
     anything happens to this cur, and she suspects that I've done it, out of
    </p>
    <p>
     spite, all Hell can't hold her. I know her well enough for _that_. No,
    </p>
    <p>
     this fellow has got to be put away on some charge that will absolutely
    </p>
    <p>
     and utterly ruin him, in her eyes, for good and all--that will blast and
    </p>
    <p>
     wreck him, forever, with her. Something that, when I tell her, will fill
    </p>
    <p>
     her with loathing and horror. Something that will cause a terrible and
    </p>
    <p>
     complete revulsion of feeling in her, and bring her back to Waldron, as
    </p>
    <p>
     to a strong refuge in time of trouble. Something that will crush and
    </p>
    <p>
     quell her, utterly cure her of those idiotic, school-girl notions of
    </p>
    <p>
     hers, and make her--as she should be--submissive to my will and my
    </p>
    <p>
     demands!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He pondered a moment, an ugly, crafty smile on those old lips of his;
    </p>
    <p>
     then, struck by sudden inspiration, laughed a dry, harsh laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The very thing!" he exulted, with the mirth of a vulture that has just
    </p>
    <p>
     found a peculiarly revolting mass of carrion. "Fool that I was, not to
    </p>
    <p>
     have thought of it before!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hastily he withdrew the letter from the envelope, opened it, and with
    </p>
    <p>
     eager hand wrote three short sentences. He read these over, nodded
    </p>
    <p>
     approval, and this time sealed and addressed the letter. Then he pushed
    </p>
    <p>
     an electric button over the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have this letter carried to this address at once," he commanded
    </p>
    <p>
     Slawson. "Mr. Dillon Slade, 432 Highland Avenue, Rutherford, N.&amp;nbsp;J.
    </p>
    <p>
     See? Special delivery won't do. Have Sanders take it at once, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     racer. No answer required. And after you've seen it start on its way,
    </p>
    <p>
     come back here. I want to go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir. All right, sir," the valet bowed as he took the letter and
    </p>
    <p>
     departed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ten minutes later, he was back again, helping old Flint undress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long after the Billionaire was in bed, in the big, luxurious room, with
    </p>
    <p>
     its windows open toward the river--the room guarded all night by armed
    </p>
    <p>
     men in the house and on the lawn outside--he lay there thinking of his
    </p>
    <p>
     plot, chuckling to himself over its infernal cunning, and filled with
    </p>
    <p>
     joy at the prospects now opening out ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Two birds with one stone, this time, for sure," he pondered. "Ha!
    </p>
    <p>
     They'll try to beat old Isaac Flint at this or any other game, will
    </p>
    <p>
     they? Man or woman, I don't care which, they'll never get away with
    </p>
    <p>
     it--never, so long as life and breath remain in me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, soothed by these happy thoughts, and by a somewhat increased
    </p>
    <p>
     dosage of his drug, the Billionaire gradually and contentedly fell
    </p>
    <p>
     asleep, to dream of victory, and vengeance, and power.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not in weeks had he slumbered so peacefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     But for many hours after her father was asleep, Catherine sat at her
    </p>
    <p>
     window, in a silk kimono, and with fevered pulses and dry eyes, with
    </p>
    <p>
     throbbing heart and leaping pulses, thought long thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sleepless she sat there, counting the hours tolled from the church-spire
    </p>
    <p>
     in the town, below.
    </p>
    <p>
     Morning still found her at the window, her brain afire, her heart laid
    </p>
    <p>
     desolate and waste by the consuming struggle which, that night, had
    </p>
    <p>
     swept and ravaged it.

     CHAPTER XXI.
    </head>
    <p>
     GABRIEL, GOOD SAMARITAN.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the evening of July third, a week later, Gabriel Armstrong found
    </p>
    <p>
     himself at Rochester, having tramped the hundred miles from Syracuse, by
    </p>
    <p>
     easy stages. During this week, old Flint took good care not to reopen
    </p>
    <p>
     the subject of the break with Waldron; and his daughter, too, avoided
    </p>
    <p>
     it. They two were apparently at an impasse regarding it. But Flint
    </p>
    <p>
     inwardly rejoiced, knowing full well the plot now under way. And though
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron urged him to take some further action and force the issue, Flint
    </p>
    <p>
     bade him hold his peace, and wait, telling him all would yet be well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outwardly calmer, the old man was raging, within, more and ever more
    </p>
    <p>
     bitterly, against Armstrong. On July first, Slade had reported in person
    </p>
    <p>
     that his operators who were trailing the quarry had--in the
    </p>
    <p>
     night--discovered in one of his pockets a maple leaf wrapped in a fine
    </p>
    <p>
     linen handkerchief marked "C.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;F." Flint, recognizing his
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter's initials, well-nigh burst a blood-vessel for wrath. But he
    </p>
    <p>
     instructed Slade not to have the handkerchief abstracted from
    </p>
    <p>
     Armstrong's possession. By no sign or hint must the victim be made aware
    </p>
    <p>
     that he was being spied upon. When the final blow should fall, then
    </p>
    <p>
     (reflected the Billionaire, with devilish satisfaction) all scores would
    </p>
    <p>
     be paid in full, and more than paid.
    </p>
    <p>
     July third, then, found Gabriel at Rochester, now seventy-five or
    </p>
    <p>
     eighty miles from Niagara Falls, his goal, where--he had already
    </p>
    <p>
     heard--ground was being actually broken for the huge new power plant of
    </p>
    <p>
     which he alone, of all outsiders, understood the meaning. Gabriel
    </p>
    <p>
     counted on spending the Fourth at Rochester where a Socialist picnic and
    </p>
    <p>
     celebration had been arranged. Ordinarily, he would have taken part in
    </p>
    <p>
     the work and volunteered as a speaker, but now, anxious to keep out of
    </p>
    <p>
     sight, he counted merely on forming one of the crowd. There could be
    </p>
    <p>
     little danger, thought he, in such a mass. Despite the recent stringent
    </p>
    <p>
     censorship and military rule of the district by the new Mounted Police,
    </p>
    <p>
     a huge gathering was expected. The big railway and lake-traffic strikes,
    </p>
    <p>
     both recently lost, had produced keen resentment, and, as political and
    </p>
    <p>
     economic power had been narrowed here, as all over the country, in these
    </p>
    <p>
     last few months of on-sweeping capitalist domination, the Socialist
    </p>
    <p>
     movement had been growing ever more and more swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It will be worth seeing," thought Gabriel, as he stood outside the
    </p>
    <p>
     lodging-house where he had taken a room for the night. The workers are
    </p>
    <p>
     surely awakening, at last. The spirit I've been meeting, lately, is
    </p>
    <p>
     uglier and more determined than anything I ever used to find, a year or
    </p>
    <p>
     two ago. It seems to me, if conditions are like this all over the
    </p>
    <p>
     country, the safety-valve is about ready to pop, and the masters had
    </p>
    <p>
     better look out, or some of them are going to land in Hell!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I'll stop over here, one day, and look and listen. Sorry I can't
    </p>
    <p>
     take part, but I mustn't. My game, now, is to travel underground as it
    </p>
    <p>
     were. I've got a bigger job in view than soap-boxing, just _now_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He ate a simple supper at an "Owl" lunch-cart, totally unaware that,
    </p>
    <p>
     across the street, a couple of Cosmos men were waiting for him to come
    </p>
    <p>
     out. And, after this, buying a Socialist paper, he strolled into Evans
    </p>
    <p>
     Park to sit and read, a while, by the red light of the descending sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here he remained till dark, smoking his briar, watching the dirty,
    </p>
    <p>
     ragged children of the wretched wage-slaves at play; observing the
    </p>
    <p>
     exploited men and women on the park-benches, as they sought a little
    </p>
    <p>
     fresh air and respite from toil; and pondering the problems that still
    </p>
    <p>
     lay before him. At times--often indeed--his thoughts wandered to the
    </p>
    <p>
     maple-grove and the old sugar-house, far away on the Hudson. Memories of
    </p>
    <p>
     the girl would not be banished, nor longings for her. Who she might be,
    </p>
    <p>
     he still knew not. Unwilling to learn, he had refrained from looking up
    </p>
    <p>
     the number he had copied from the plate of the wrecked machine. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     even abstained from reading the papers, a few days, lest he might see
    </p>
    <p>
     some account of the accident. A strange kind of unwillingness to know
    </p>
    <p>
     the woman's name possessed him--a feeling that, if he positively
    </p>
    <p>
     identified her as one of some famous clan of robbers and exploiters, he
    </p>
    <p>
     could no longer cherish her memory or love the thought of how they two
    </p>
    <p>
     had, for an hour, sat together and talked and been good, honest friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," he murmured to himself, "it's better this way--just to recall her
    </p>
    <p>
     as a girl in need, a girl who let me help her, a girl I can always
    </p>
    <p>
     remember with kind thoughts, as long as I live!"
    </p>
    <p>
     From his pocket he took the little handkerchief, which wrapped the
    </p>
    <p>
     leaf, once part of her bed. A faint, elusive scent still hung about
    </p>
    <p>
     it--something of her, still it seemed. He closed his eyes, there on the
    </p>
    <p>
     hard park bench, and let his fancies rove whither they would; and for a
    </p>
    <p>
     time it seemed to him a wondrous peace possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If it could only have been," he murmured, at last. "If only it could
    </p>
    <p>
     be!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then suddenly urged by a realization of the hopelessness of it all, he
    </p>
    <p>
     stood up, pocketed the souvenirs of her again, and walked away in the
    </p>
    <p>
     dusk; away, through the park; away, at random, through squalid, ugly
    </p>
    <p>
     streets, where the first electric-lights were just beginning to flare;
    </p>
    <p>
     where children swarmed in the close heat, wallowing along the gutters,
    </p>
    <p>
     dodging teams and cars, as they essayed to play, setting off a few
    </p>
    <p>
     premature firecrackers and mocking the police--all in all, leading the
    </p>
    <p>
     ugly, unnatural, destructive life of all children of the city
    </p>
    <p>
     proletariat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Poor little devils!" thought Gabriel, stopping to observe a dirty group
    </p>
    <p>
     clustered about an ice-cream cart, where cheap, adulterated,
    </p>
    <p>
     high-colored stuff was being sold for a penny a square--aniline poison,
    </p>
    <p>
     no doubt, and God knows what else. "Poor little kids! Not much like the
    </p>
    <p>
     children of the masters, eh? with their lawns and playgrounds, their
    </p>
    <p>
     beaches and flowery fields, their gardens and fine schools, their dogs,
    </p>
    <p>
     ponies, autos and all the rest! Some difference, all right--and it takes
    </p>
    <p>
     a thousand of _these_, yes, ten thousand, to keep one of _those_.
    </p>
    <p>
     And--and _she_ was one of the rich and dainty children! Her beauty,
    </p>
    <p>
     health and grace were bought at the price of ten thousand other
    </p>
    <p>
     children's health, and joy and lives! Ah, God, what a price! What a
    </p>
    <p>
     cruel, awful, barbarous price to pay!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Saddened and pensive, he passed on, still thinking of the woman he could
    </p>
    <p>
     not banish from his mind, despite his bitterness against her class.
    </p>
    <p>
     So he walked on and on, now through better streets and now through
    </p>
    <p>
     worse, up and down the city.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here and there, detonations and red fire marked the impatience of some
    </p>
    <p>
     demonstrator who could not wait till midnight to show his ardent
    </p>
    <p>
     patriotism and his public spirit by risking life and property. The
    </p>
    <p>
     saloons were all doing a land-office business, with the holiday
    </p>
    <p>
     impending and the thermometer at 97. Now and then, slattern women, in
    </p>
    <p>
     foul clothes and with huge, gelatinous breasts, could be seen rushing
    </p>
    <p>
     the growler, at the "family entrance" of some low dive. Even little
    </p>
    <p>
     girls bore tin pails, for the evening's "scuttle o' suds" to be consumed
    </p>
    <p>
     on roof, or in back yard of stinking tenement, or on some fire-escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     The city, in fine, was relaxing from its toil; and, as the workers for
    </p>
    <p>
     the most part knew no other way, nor could afford any, they were trying
    </p>
    <p>
     to snatch some brief moment of respite from the Hell of their slavery,
    </p>
    <p>
     by recourse to rough ribaldry and alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nine o'clock had just struck from the church-spires which mocked the
    </p>
    <p>
     slums with their appeal to an impassive Heaven, when, passing a foul and
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow alley that led down to the Genesee River, Gabriel saw a woman
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting on a doorstep, weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
     This woman--hardly more than a girl--was holding a little bundle in one
    </p>
    <p>
     hand. The other covered her face. Her sobs were audible. Grief of the
    </p>
    <p>
     most intense, he saw at once, convulsed her. Two or three by-standers,
    </p>
    <p>
     watching with a kind of pleased curiosity, completed the scene, most
    </p>
    <p>
     sordid in its setting, there under the flicker of a gas-light on the
    </p>
    <p>
     corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm! What now?" thought Gabriel, stopping to watch the little tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "More trouble, eh? It's trouble all up and down the line, for these poor
    </p>
    <p>
     devils! Nothing but trouble for the slave-class. Well, well, let's see
    </p>
    <p>
     what's wrong _now_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel turned down the alley, drew near the little group, and halted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's wrong?" he asked, in the tone of authority he knew how to use;
    </p>
    <p>
     the tone which always overbore his outward aspect, even though he might
    </p>
    <p>
     have been clad in rags; the tone which made men yield to him, and women
    </p>
    <p>
     look at him with trustful eyes, even as the Billionaire's daughter had
    </p>
    <p>
     looked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Search _me_!" murmured one of the men, shrugging his shoulders. "_I_
    </p>
    <p>
     can't git nothin' out o' her. She's been sittin' here, cryin', a few
    </p>
    <p>
     minutes, that's all I know; an' she won't say nothin' to nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Any of you men know anything about it?" demanded Gabriel, looking at
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     A murmur of negation was his only answer. One or two others, scenting
    </p>
    <p>
     some excitement, even though only that of a distressed woman--common
    </p>
    <p>
     sight, indeed!--lingered near. The little group was growing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel bent and touched the woman's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's the matter?" asked he, in a gentle voice. "If you're in trouble,
    </p>
    <p>
     let me help you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Renewed sobs were her only answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you'll only tell me what's the matter," Gabriel went on, "I'm sure
    </p>
    <p>
     I can do something for you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You--you can't!" choked the woman, without raising her head from the
    </p>
    <p>
     corner of the ragged shawl that she was holding over her eyes. "Nobody
    </p>
    <p>
     can't! Bill, he's gone, and Eddy's gone, and Mr. Micolo says he won't
    </p>
    <p>
     let me in. So there ain't nothin' to do. Let me alone--oh dear, oh dear,
    </p>
    <p>
     dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Fresh tears and grief. The little knot of spectators, still growing,
    </p>
    <p>
     nodded with approval, and figuratively licked its lips, in satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somewhere a boy snickered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come, come," said Gabriel, bending close over the grief-stricken woman,
    </p>
    <p>
     "pull together, and let's hear what the trouble is! Who's Bill, and
    </p>
    <p>
     who's Eddy--and what about Mr. Micolo? Come, tell me. I'm sure I can do
    </p>
    <p>
     something to straighten things out."
    </p>
    <p>
     No answer. Gabriel turned to the increasing crowd, again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Any of you people know what about it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again no answer, save that one elderly man, standing on the steps beside
    </p>
    <p>
     the woman, remarked casually:
    </p>
    <p>
     "I guess she's got fired out of her room. That's all I know."
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel took her by the arm, and drew her up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come, now!" said he, a sterner note in his voice. "This won't do! You
    </p>
    <p>
     mustn't sit here, and draw a crowd. First thing you know an officer will
    </p>
    <p>
     be along, and you may get into trouble. Tell me what's wrong, and I
    </p>
    <p>
     promise to see you through it, as far as I can."
    </p>
    <p>
     She raised her face, now, and looked at him, a moment. Tear-stained and
    </p>
    <p>
     dishevelled though she was, and soiled by marks of drink and
    </p>
    <p>
     debauchery, Gabriel saw she must once have been very beautiful and still
    </p>
    <p>
     was comely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," he asked. "Aren't you going to tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell you?" she repeated. "I--oh, I can't! Not in front of all them
    </p>
    <p>
     men!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well!" said he, "walk with me, and give me your story. Will you do
    </p>
    <p>
     that? At all events, you mustn't stay here, making a disturbance on the
    </p>
    <p>
     highway. If you knew the police as well as I do, you'd understand that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're right, friend," said she, hoarsely. "I'm on, now. Come along
    </p>
    <p>
     then--I'll tell you. It ain't much to tell; but it's a lot to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She glanced at the curious faces of the watchers, then turned and
    </p>
    <p>
     followed Gabriel, who was already walking up the alley, toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     brighter lights of Stuart Street. For a moment, one or two of the men
    </p>
    <p>
     hesitated as though undecided whether or not to follow after; but one
    </p>
    <p>
     backward look by Gabriel instantly dispelled any desire to intrude. And
    </p>
    <p>
     as Gabriel and the woman turned into the street, the little knot of
    </p>
    <p>
     curiosity-seekers dissolved into its component atoms, and vanished.
    </p>

     CHAPTER XXII.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE TRAP IS SPRUNG.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It--it's all along o' that there Mr. Micolo!" the woman suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     exclaimed, "Him an' his rent-bill! If he'd ha' let me in, there,
    </p>
    <p>
     tonight, I could ha' got Ed's things an' then started to my sister's,
    </p>
    <p>
     out to Scottsville. But he wouldn't. He claimed they was
    </p>
    <p>
     two-seventy-five still owin', and I didn't have but about fifty cents,
    </p>
    <p>
     so I couldn't pay it. So he wouldn't let me in. Natchally, anybody'd
    </p>
    <p>
     feel bad, like that, 'specially when a man told 'em he'd hold their
    </p>
    <p>
     kid's clothes an' things till they paid--which they couldn't!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Naturally, of course," answered Gabriel, rather dazed by this sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     burst of details, with which she seemed to think he should already be
    </p>
    <p>
     quite familiar--details all sordid and commonplace, through which he
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to perceive, dimly as in a dark glass, some mean and ugly tragedy
    </p>
    <p>
     of poverty and ignorance and sin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you hungry?" he asked, all at once. "If so, come in here, where we
    </p>
    <p>
     can talk quietly and get things straight." He pointed at a cheap
    </p>
    <p>
     restaurant, across the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hungry? Gord, yes!" she exclaimed. Only I--I wouldn't ask, if I fell on
    </p>
    <p>
     the sidewalk! Fifty cents--yes, I got that much, but I been tryin' to
    </p>
    <p>
     get enough to pay Mr. Micolo, an' get hold of Ed's things, an'--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right, forget that, now," commanded Gabriel. He took her by the
    </p>
    <p>
     arm and piloted her across the thoroughfare, then into the dingy
    </p>
    <p>
     hash-house and to a table in a far corner. A few minutes later, pretty
    </p>
    <p>
     much everything on the bill of fare was before them on the greasy table.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not a word till you're satisfied," directed Armstrong. "I'll just take
    </p>
    <p>
     a little bread and coffee, to keep you company."
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman adequately proved her statement that she was hungry. Rarely
    </p>
    <p>
     had Gabriel seen anybody eat with such ravenous appetite. He watched her
    </p>
    <p>
     with satisfaction, and when she could consume no more, smiled as he
    </p>
    <p>
     asked:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, then, feel better? If so, let's tackle the next problem. What's
    </p>
    <p>
     your grief?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman stared at him a long moment before she made reply. Then she
    </p>
    <p>
     exclaimed suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
     "You ain't no kind of 'bull,' are you? Nor plain-clothes man?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," said he, "nothing of that kind. You can trust me. Let's have the
    </p>
    <p>
     story."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm! It ain't much, I s'pose," she answered still half-suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bill and me was livin' together, that's all. No, not married, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     nothin'--but--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That was last winter. When the kid happened--Ed, you know--Bill, he got
    </p>
    <p>
     sore, an' beat it. Then I--I went on the street, to keep Ed. Nothin'
    </p>
    <p>
     else to do, Mister, so help me, an'--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Never mind, I understand," said Gabriel. "What next?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And after that, I gets sick. _You_ know. Almost right away. So I has
    </p>
    <p>
     to go to St. Luke's hospital. I leaves Ed with Mrs. McCane, at the same
    </p>
    <p>
     house. That place in the alley, you know. Well, when I gets out, the
    </p>
    <p>
     boy's dead. _An_' they never even tells me, till I goes back! An' I
    </p>
    <p>
     can't even get his things. Because why? Mrs. McCane's gone, Gord knows
    </p>
    <p>
     where, an' Mr. Micolo says I still owe two-seventy-five. I want to get
    </p>
    <p>
     down there to Scottsville, to my sister's; but curse _me_ if I'll go
    </p>
    <p>
     till I pay that devil an' get them clothes!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A sudden savage light in her blurred eyes betrayed the passion of the
    </p>
    <p>
     mother-love, through all the filth and soilure of her degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel felt his heart deeply moved. He bent toward her, across the
    </p>
    <p>
     table, touched her hand and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Will you accept five dollars, to pay this man and get you down to
    </p>
    <p>
     Scottsville?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Huh?" she queried, gazing at him with vacant, uncomprehending eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     He repeated his query. Then, as he saw the slow tears start and roll
    </p>
    <p>
     down her wan cheeks, he felt a greater joy within his breast than if the
    </p>
    <p>
     world and all its treasures had been his.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Will I take it?" she whispered. "Gord, _will_ I? You bet I will! That
    </p>
    <p>
     is, if I can have your name, an' pay it back some time?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He promised, and wrote it down for her, giving as his address Socialist
    </p>
    <p>
     Headquarters in Chicago. Then, without publicity, he slipped a V into
    </p>
    <p>
     her trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come on," said he. "_That's_ all settled!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He paid the check, and they went out, together. For a moment they stood
    </p>
    <p>
     together, undecided, on the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Couldn't I get them things to-night, an' start?" asked she, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's a train at 11:08, on the B.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;P."
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right," he assented. "Can you see this Micolo, now? It's after
    </p>
    <p>
     ten."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, _that_ don't make no difference," she answered. "He runs a pawnshop
    </p>
    <p>
     over here on Dexter Street, two blocks east. He'll be open till
    </p>
    <p>
     midnight, easy, tomorrow bein' the Fourth."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come on, then," said Gabriel. "I'll see you through the whole business,
    </p>
    <p>
     and onto the train. Maybe I can help you, all along."
    </p>
    <p>
     Without another word she started, with Gabriel at her side. They
    </p>
    <p>
     traversed the main street, two blocks, then turned to the left down a
    </p>
    <p>
     narrower, darker one.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here's Micolo's," said she, pausing at a doorway. Gabriel nodded. "All
    </p>
    <p>
     right," he answered. He had not noted, nor did he dream, that, at the
    </p>
    <p>
     corner behind them, two slinking, sneaking figures were now watching his
    </p>
    <p>
     every move.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman turned the knob, and entered. Gabriel followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's on the second floor," said she. Gabriel saw a sign, on the
    </p>
    <p>
     landing: "S.&amp;nbsp;L. Micolo, Pawn Broker," and motioned her to precede
    </p>
    <p>
     him.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a minute they had reached the upper hallway. The woman opened another
    </p>
    <p>
     door. The room, inside, was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This way," said she. "He's in the inside office, I guess. The light
    </p>
    <p>
     must ha' gone out here, some way or other."
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel hesitated. Some inkling, some vague intuition all at once had
    </p>
    <p>
     come upon him, that all was not well. At his elbow some invisible force
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed plucking. "Come away! Come back, before it is too late!" some
    </p>
    <p>
     ghostly voice seemed calling in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     But still, he did not fully understand. Still he remained there, his
    </p>
    <p>
     mind obsessed by the plausibility of the woman's story and by the pity
    </p>
    <p>
     he so keenly felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now he heard her voice again:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mr. Micolo! Oh, Mr. Micolo! Where are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Striking a match, he advanced into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Any gas here?" he asked, peering about for a burner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly he started with violent emotion. Behind him, in some
    </p>
    <p>
     unaccountable way, the door had been closed. He heard a key turn,
    </p>
    <p>
     softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What--what's this?" he exclaimed. He heard the woman moving about,
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhere in the gloom. "See here!" he cried. "What kind of a--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The match burned brightly, all at once. He peered about him, wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This is no office!" shouted he. "Here, you! What's the meaning of this?
    </p>
    <p>
     This is a bed-room!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Sudden realization of the trap stunned and sickened him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God! They've got me! Flint and Waldron--they've landed me, at last!" he
    </p>
    <p>
     choked. "But--but not till I've broken a few heads, by God!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The match fell from his burnt fingers. Whirling toward the door, he
    </p>
    <p>
     rained powerful kicks upon it. He would get out, he must get out, at all
    </p>
    <p>
     hazards!
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly the woman began to scream, with harsh and piercing cries that
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to rip the very atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: Aiming at the base of the skull she struck.]
    </p>
    <p>
     At the third scream, or the fourth, the key was turned and the door
    </p>
    <p>
     jerked open.
    </p>
    <p>
     In its aperture, three men stood--the two who had been so long trailing
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel, and a policeman, burly, red-jowled, big-paunched.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel stared at them. His mouth opened, then closed again without a
    </p>
    <p>
     word. As well for a trapped animal to make explanations to the Indian
    </p>
    <p>
     hunter, as for him to tell these men the truth. The truth? _They_ knew
    </p>
    <p>
     the truth; and they were there to crucify him. He read it in their
    </p>
    <p>
     cruel, eager eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman had stopped screaming now, and was weeping with abandon,
    </p>
    <p>
     pouring forth a tale of insults and abuse and robbery, with hysterical
    </p>
    <p>
     sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Full in the faces of the three men Gabriel sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You've done a good job of it, this time, you skunks!" he gibed. "I'm
    </p>
    <p>
     on. You'll get me, in the end; but not just yet. The first man through
    </p>
    <p>
     this door gets his head broken--and that goes, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With a snarl of "You damned white slaver!" the officer raised his
    </p>
    <p>
     night-stick and hurled himself at Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel ducked and planted a terrific left-hander on the "bull's" ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Roaring, the majesty of the law careened against the bed, crashed the
    </p>
    <p>
     flimsy thing to wreckage and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, fighting back into the gloom of the trap, Gabriel engaged the two
    </p>
    <p>
     detectives. For a moment he held them. One went to the floor with an
    </p>
    <p>
     uppercut under the chin; but came back. The other landed hard on
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel's jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     He turned to strike down, again, the first of the two. He heard the bed
    </p>
    <p>
     creaking, and saw the policeman struggling to arise. In a whirlwind of
    </p>
    <p>
     blows, the second detective flailed at him, striving to beat down his
    </p>
    <p>
     guard and floor him with a vicious rib-jolt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All's fair, here!" thought Gabriel, snatching up a chair. For a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     he brandished it on high. With this weapon, he knew--though final defeat
    </p>
    <p>
     was inevitable, when reinforcements should arrive--he could sweep a
    </p>
    <p>
     clear space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps he might even yet escape! He heard feet trampling on the stairs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and his heart died within him. Well, even though escape were impossible,
    </p>
    <p>
     he would fight to a finish and die game, if die he must!
    </p>
    <p>
     Down swung the chair, and round, crashing to ruin as it struck the
    </p>
    <p>
     policeman who was just getting to his feet again. Oaths, cries, screams
    </p>
    <p>
     made the place hideous. Dust rose, and blood began to flow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Armed now with one leg of the chair, Gabriel retreated; and as he went,
    </p>
    <p>
     he hurled the bitterness of all his scorn and hate upon these vile
    </p>
    <p>
     conspirators.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as he flayed them with his tongue, he struck; and like Samson
    </p>
    <p>
     against the Philistines, he did great execution.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like Samson, too, he lost his power through a woman's treachery. For,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as the attackers seemed to fall back, shattered and at a loss
    </p>
    <p>
     before such fury and tremendous strength, behind Gabriel the woman rose,
    </p>
    <p>
     a laugh of malice on her lips, the policeman's long and heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     night-stick in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     A moment she poised it, crouching as he--seeing her not--swung his
    </p>
    <p>
     weapon and hurled his defiance at the baffled men in front.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, aiming at the base of the skull, she struck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sudden bright lights spangled the darkness, for Gabriel. Everything
    </p>
    <p>
     whirled about, in dizzying confusion. A strange, far roaring sounded in
    </p>
    <p>
     his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he fell; and oblivion took him to its blessed peace and rest; and
    </p>
    <p>
     all grew still and black.

    <p>
     THE BEAST GLOATS.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fer Gawd's sake, let's have a light here, somebody!" panted the
    </p>
    <p>
     dishevelled policeman. Outside, the ringing of a gong became audible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then came a clattering of hoofs, as the police-patrol, nicely-timed by
    </p>
    <p>
     the conspirators, and summoned by a confederate, drew up at the box on
    </p>
    <p>
     the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somebody struck another match, and a raw gas-light flared. From the
    </p>
    <p>
     hallway, two or three others crowded into the wrecked room. Disjointed
    </p>
    <p>
     exclamations, oaths and curses intermingled with harsh laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman--Lillian Rafter, probably the finest actress and stool-pigeon
    </p>
    <p>
     in the whole detective world of graft and crookedness--lighted a
    </p>
    <p>
     cigarette at the gas-burner, and laughed with triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Some make-up, eh kid?" she demanded of the taller detective, who was
    </p>
    <p>
     now nursing a bad "shiner," as a black eye is known in the under-world,
    </p>
    <p>
     and whose face was battered to a bleeding pulp. "Believe me, as a job,
    </p>
    <p>
     this is some job! From start to finish, a pippin. He was bound to fall
    </p>
    <p>
     for it though. No help for him. Even if he hadn't butted into the
    </p>
    <p>
     'plant' we fixed for him in the alley, there, I could have braced him in
    </p>
    <p>
     the street with my tale of woe. He was just bound to be 'it,' this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     We had him going, all ways for Sunday!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Scornfully the woman Gabriel had befriended in her seeming misery, spat
    </p>
    <p>
     at him as he lay there stunned and scarcely breathing on the dirty
    </p>
    <p>
     floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And just pipe this, will you, too?" she exulted, holding up the
    </p>
    <p>
     five-dollar bill he had given her. "And this?" She exhibited his name
    </p>
    <p>
     and address, written on a card. "In his own writing, boys. As evidence
    </p>
    <p>
     to hold him on a white slave charge, is this some evidence or isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, we'll hold him, all right!" growled the other detective, whose
    </p>
    <p>
     right arm dangled limp, where the chair had struck him. "The ---- ----
    </p>
    <p>
     of a ----! He'll go up for a finif, a five-spot, or I'm a liar! And once
    </p>
    <p>
     we get him behind bars, good-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He deliberately drew back his heavy boot and kicked Gabriel full in the
    </p>
    <p>
     face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You ---- ----!" he cursed. "Try to bean _me_, will you? Damn you!
    </p>
    <p>
     You've made _your_ last soap-box spiel!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come on, now, boys, out with him, an' no more rag-chewin'!" the
    </p>
    <p>
     policeman exclaimed. "Git him in the wagon, an' away, before a gang
    </p>
    <p>
     piles in here! You, Caffery, take his feet. I'll manage his head. Jesus,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he's some big guy, though, the ---- ---- of a ----!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Together, the battered policeman and the detective who still had some
    </p>
    <p>
     strength left in him, raised Gabriel's limp body and carried it from the
    </p>
    <p>
     room. The woman, meanwhile, stood there inhaling cigarette-smoke and
    </p>
    <p>
     laughing viciously to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You easy mutt!" she exclaimed. "Dead baby, room-rent due, wanted to get
    </p>
    <p>
     home to sister--and you fell for that old gag with whiskers on it!
    </p>
    <p>
     You're some wise guy all right, all right, I don't think. Well, as a
    </p>
    <p>
     stall it was a beaut. And I must say I never screamed better in all my
    </p>
    <p>
     life. And that wallop I handed out, was a peach. If I don't pull down
    </p>
    <p>
     five hundred for this night's work--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shut up, you ----!" snarled Caffery, as he turned into the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Keep that lip o' yours quiet, will you, or--"
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman stared at him a moment, then laughed insolently and snapped
    </p>
    <p>
     her smoke-yellowed fingers at him in defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mind you show up in court, in the mornin'!" panted the officer,
    </p>
    <p>
     staggering downstairs under the weight of Gabriel's huge shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Better arrest her now," suggested Caffery, "an' hold her."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You will, like Hell!" retorted the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shhh! In one door an' out the other," the second detective whispered in
    </p>
    <p>
     her ear, as she stood there in the doorway. "I'll see to it you get
    </p>
    <p>
     fifty extra for _that_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, if that's the game, fine business!" she smiled. "Go to it--I'm your
    </p>
    <p>
     huckleberry!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus it befell that, while a large and growing crowd observed, under the
    </p>
    <p>
     arc-light on the corner--a crowd where no fewer than six reporters, all
    </p>
    <p>
     duly tipped off in advance, were taking notes--Gabriel Armstrong, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialist speaker and leader, was bundled, unconscious, into a patrol
    </p>
    <p>
     wagon of the City of Rochester; and with him, a drunken-acting harlot,
    </p>
    <p>
     babbling charges of white-slave extortion and violence against him; and
    </p>
    <p>
     with them both, several witnesses, who would have sworn that Heaven was
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell, for five dollars cash in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus was the stage set, for the next session of the honorable court.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus were the wires pulled. Thus, the prison doors were swung wide open,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, above all, the honor and the reputation of a man swept to the
    </p>
    <p>
     garbage-heaps of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     True, at the morrow's great mass-meeting, there were destined to be
    </p>
    <p>
     protests and calls for investigation. The Socialist press was destined
    </p>
    <p>
     to take it up, defend him and demand the truth. But, swamped by a
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly overwhelming capitalist press, not only naturally hostile but
    </p>
    <p>
     in this case already heavily subsidized; shattered by the close-knit,
    </p>
    <p>
     circumstantial evidence; hamstrung and hampered in every way by the
    </p>
    <p>
     power of unlimited money and Tammany pull, the Socialists might as well
    </p>
    <p>
     have tried to sweep back the sea with a broom as save this man from
    </p>
    <p>
     legal crucifixion. Worse still, they themselves, and the beaten strikers
    </p>
    <p>
     with whom they had been fraternizing, got a black eye in the affair; and
    </p>
    <p>
     many an editorial column, many a pulpit, unctuously discoursed thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many an anti-Socialist thug and grafter, loud-mouthed and blatant,
    </p>
    <p>
     bellowed revamped platitudes of "immorality" and "breaking up the home,"
    </p>
    <p>
     and the "nation of fatherless children," pointing at Gabriel Armstrong
    </p>
    <p>
     as a shining example of Socialist hypocrisy and filth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Press, law, church, capitalism itself nailed this man and the movement
    </p>
    <p>
     he stood for, to the cross. And the pimps and parasites of the private
    </p>
    <p>
     detective agency chuckled in their well-paid glee. The woman, Gabriel's
    </p>
    <p>
     betrayer, counted her "thirty pieces of silver" and laughed in the foul
    </p>
    <p>
     dark. The police cut a fine melon secretly handed them by Flint; and so,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, did the local papers and more than one local pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, in Gabriel's grief and woe and desolation, as he sat in his grim
    </p>
    <p>
     cell with aching head, bruised face and bleeding heart, with all his
    </p>
    <p>
     plans now broken, with the very soul within him dead--in this grief and
    </p>
    <p>
     anguish, I say, the foul harpy-brood of Capitalism revelled and rioted
    </p>
    <p>
     like maggots in carrion.
    </p>
    <p>
     None more viciously than old Flint, himself. None with more brutal joy,
    </p>
    <p>
     more savage satisfaction. One of the culminant moments of his life, he
    </p>
    <p>
     felt, was on the evening after the dastardly plot had been carried to
    </p>
    <p>
     its putrid conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Opening the Rochester "News-Intelligencer" which Slade had sent him, his
    </p>
    <p>
     glittering eyes seemed to sparkle joy as a blue-penciled column met his
    </p>
    <p>
     gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eagerly he read it all, every word, and weighed it, and re-read it, as
    </p>
    <p>
     men do when news is dear to their souls. Already, through the New York
    </p>
    <p>
     papers he had got the essentials of the affair. Already, by long
    </p>
    <p>
     distance 'phone he had received the outlines of the news from Slade, as
    </p>
    <p>
     well as a code telegram of more than 500 words, giving him additional
    </p>
    <p>
     details. But this paper especially pleased him. The other Rochester
    </p>
    <p>
     sheets, which Slade would send as fast as they appeared, he already was
    </p>
    <p>
     looking forward to, with keenest pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah! _This_ is what I call efficiency!" he exclaimed, settling himself
    </p>
    <p>
     in his big chair, adjusting the pince-nez on his hawk-bill and preparing
    </p>
    <p>
     to read the column for the third time. "The way this thing was planned
    </p>
    <p>
     and carried out, and the manner in which Slade has managed to get it
    </p>
    <p>
     played up in the papers, proves to me he's a general in his line, a true
    </p>
    <p>
     Napoleon. I may safely intrust any affair of this sort to him and his
    </p>
    <p>
     agency. No fee of his shall ever be questioned; and as for
    </p>
    <p>
     bonuses--well, he shall have no reason to complain. An admirable man, in
    </p>
    <p>
     every way--a wonderful organization! With men and agencies like _these_
    </p>
    <p>
     at work in our interests, what have we, really, to be uneasy about?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Smacking his mental lips, if I may be pardoned the phrase, he once more
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly read the delightful, gratifying news:
    </p>
    <p>
     _SOCIALIST WHITE-SLAVER!_
    </p>
    <p>
     _Rotten Affair Unearthed by Police!_
    </p>
    <p>
     _Gabriel Armstrong, Socialist Leader, Caught With the Goods!!!_
    </p>
    <p>
     Rochester, July 4.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In one of the most sensational raids ever made in this city, by
    </p>
    <p>
     the vice squad, under the auspices of the Purity League, what is
    </p>
    <p>
     believed to be a well-organized white-slave business was unearthed
    </p>
    <p>
     last night. The leader and brains of the association, Gabriel
    </p>
    <p>
     Armstrong, a Socialist speaker and worker of national prominence,
    </p>
    <p>
     was arrested, and is now lodged in Police Headquarters, with
    </p>
    <p>
     serious charges pending.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The arrest was made as a result of the keen work of Officer
    </p>
    <p>
     Michael P. Duffey, sergeant of the vice squad. Hearing screams in
    </p>
    <p>
     the assignation house at 42A Belding street, he made his way up
    </p>
    <p>
     stairs, accompanied by two or three citizens. The screams were
    </p>
    <p>
     coming from a room on the second floor. Duffey promptly battered
    </p>
    <p>
     the door down only to be met by a furious assault from Armstrong,
    </p>
    <p>
     who was intoxicated and extremely violent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A savage hand-to-hand struggle took place, in which furniture was
    </p>
    <p>
     broken, the policeman badly injured and two of the volunteers
    </p>
    <p>
     knocked out. Armstrong was finally subdued, however, by the
    </p>
    <p>
     jiu-jitsu method, in which Duffey is an expert, and was lodged in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Central Station, together with the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "According to her statement, the man, Armstrong, had not only been
    </p>
    <p>
     guilty of grossly immoral practices with her, but had also been
    </p>
    <p>
     trying to force her to share with him the proceeds of her life of
    </p>
    <p>
     shame, thus making out against him a clear case under the Mann
    </p>
    <p>
     White-Slave Traffic law. She has material evidence of this
    </p>
    <p>
     fact--money which he had given her, to finance her till she could
    </p>
    <p>
     begin bringing in revenue to him, and also his name and address,
    </p>
    <p>
     written by his own hand. A significant fact is that the address
    </p>
    <p>
     given by this white slaver is Socialist headquarters, in Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
     The police are now working on the theory that the entire Socialist
    </p>
    <p>
     organization is honeycombed with this traffic, and that the
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialist movement is only a blind to cover a wholesale
    </p>
    <p>
     distribution of women for immoral purposes. Drastic Federal action
    </p>
    <p>
     against the Socialist Party is now being considered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Still further and more sensational facts are expected to develop
    </p>
    <p>
     at the preliminary hearing, which will take place tomorrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     In case Armstrong is bound over to the Grand Jury, and convicted,
    </p>
    <p>
     he may get a heavy fine and as much as five years in a Federal
    </p>
    <p>
     penitentiary. He is described as being a surly, low type, reticent
    </p>
    <p>
     and vindictive, of vicious characteristics and mentally defective.
    </p>
    <p>
     The local Socialists have already taken up arms in his defense, as
    </p>
    <p>
     was to be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Interest is added to the case by the fact that Armstrong is known
    </p>
    <p>
     to be the man who, at the time of the recent automobile accident to
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Catherine Flint--daughter of Isaac Flint, of Englewood,
    </p>
    <p>
     N.&amp;nbsp;J.--gave the alarm. A theory is now being formed that he
    </p>
    <p>
     was, in some way, involved in a plot with Miss Flint's chauffeur to
    </p>
    <p>
     wreck the machine and share a big reward for rescuing the girl. The
    </p>
    <p>
     plot, however, evidently miscarried, for the chauffeur was killed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and Armstrong, after giving the alarm, feared to divulge his
    </p>
    <p>
     identity but fled in disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Public interest is greatly aroused in this matter. And if, as now
    </p>
    <p>
     seems positively certain, this arrest and forthcoming conviction
    </p>
    <p>
     break up the vicious white-slave gang for some time operating in
    </p>
    <p>
     Rochester and Ontario Beach, the public will have a still greater
    </p>
    <p>
     debt of gratitude toward the Purity League, the Vice Squad and the
    </p>
    <p>
     untiring efforts and bravery of Sergeant Duffey."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That, ah that," remarked old Flint, as he finished his last reading,
    </p>
    <p>
     "is what I call literature! It may not be Scott or Shelley or Dickens,
    </p>
    <p>
     but it's got far more than _they_ ever had--tremendous value to--er--to
    </p>
    <p>
     the rightful masters of society. I dare say that this article and also
    </p>
    <p>
     others like it that are bound to be printed during the trial and after,
    </p>
    <p>
     will do more to secure our position in society than a whole army with
    </p>
    <p>
     machine guns. Socialism, eh? After this campaign gets through, by God,
    </p>
    <p>
     we'll sweep up the leavings in a dustpan and throw them out the window!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Again he surveyed the article, smiling thinly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Literature, yes," he repeated. "The writer of those lines, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     master-minds who engineered the whole affair, must and shall be
    </p>
    <p>
     liberally rewarded. Editors, preachers, writers, they're all on our
    </p>
    <p>
     side. All safe and sane--that is, nearly all--enough, at any event, to
    </p>
    <p>
     assure our safety. I rejoice that I have lived to see this day!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He turned the sheets of the paper, to see if any other notice of the
    </p>
    <p>
     affair was printed; and as he looked, he pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Imagine the effect of this, on Kate!" thought he. "It will be just as I
    </p>
    <p>
     planned it. Nothing will be left in her mind now, but loathing, hate and
    </p>
    <p>
     rage against this man. In two days, she and Waldron will have patched up
    </p>
    <p>
     their little difference, and all will be well. A master-stroke on my
    </p>
    <p>
     part, eh? Yes, yes indeed, a master-stroke!"
    </p>
    <p>
     His eye caught another blue-pencilling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Editorial, eh?" said he, adjusting his glasses. "Better and better!
    </p>
    <p>
     This affair will sweep those troublemakers off the map, or I'm a
    </p>
    <p>
     beggar!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, with the keenest of satisfaction, he focussed his attention on the
    </p>
    <p>
     sapient editorial:
    </p>
    <p>
     _SOCIALISM UNVEILED_.
    </p>
    <p>
     The arrest and impending conviction of Gabriel Armstrong, the noted
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialist leader, on a white-slave traffic charge, will do much to
    </p>
    <p>
     set all sane thinkers right in regard to this whole matter of
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialist ethics. Socialists, as we have all heard, contend that
    </p>
    <p>
     their system of thought teaches a high and pure form of morality.
    </p>
    <p>
     How will they square this assertion with the hard, cold facts, as
    </p>
    <p>
     brought to light in this most revolting case?
    </p>
    <p>
     Much more seems to lie beneath the surface than at first sight
    </p>
    <p>
     appears. Though we desire to suspend judgment until all the data
    </p>
    <p>
     are known, it appears conclusively proved that Armstrong is but one
    </p>
    <p>
     of a band of white-slavers operating through the organization of,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with the consent of the Socialist party, or at least of its
    </p>
    <p>
     responsible officials.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this prove to be the case, it will substantiate the suspicion
    </p>
    <p>
     long felt in many quarters that this whole movement, ostensibly
    </p>
    <p>
     political, is really a menace to the moral and social welfare of
    </p>
    <p>
     the nation. A foreign importation, openly standing against the
    </p>
    <p>
     home, the family and religion, may well be expected to foster such
    </p>
    <p>
     crimes and to be a "culture-medium" for the growth of such vile
    </p>
    <p>
     microbes as this man Armstrong, and others of his kind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turn on the light! Bring the social antiseptics! Let all the facts
    </p>
    <p>
     be established; and when known, if--as we anticipate--they prove
    </p>
    <p>
     this nasty conspiracy, let us make an end, now and forever, to this
    </p>
    <p>
     un-American, immoral and filthy thing, Socialism! To this object
    </p>
    <p>
     this paper now and henceforth pledges its policy; and all decent
    </p>
    <p>
     publications, all citizens who love their country, their God, their
    </p>
    <p>
     homes, their flag, will join with it in a nation-wide crusade to
    </p>
    <p>
     choke this slimy monster of Anarchy and Free-love, and fling it
    </p>
    <p>
     back into the Pit where it belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long live religion, purity and the flag! Down with Socialism!
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint regarded this masterpiece with an approving eye. Then, chuckling
    </p>
    <p>
     to himself, he arose and with slow steps advanced toward the dining-room
    </p>
    <p>
     where already Catherine was awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now," he murmured to himself, and smiled thinly, "now for a little
    </p>
    <p>
     scene with Kate!"
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     CHAPTER XXIV.
    </head>
    <p>
     CATHERINE'S SUPREME DECISION.
    </p>
    <p>
     The meal was almost at an end--silently, like all their hours spent
    </p>
    <p>
     together, now--before the old man sprang his _coup_. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     characteristic of him to wait thus, to hold his fire till what he
    </p>
    <p>
     conceived to be the opportune moment; never to act prematurely, under
    </p>
    <p>
     any circumstances whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the way, Kate," he remarked, casually, when coffee had been served
    </p>
    <p>
     and he had motioned the butlers out of the room, "by the way, I've been
    </p>
    <p>
     rather badly disappointed, today. Did you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, father," she answered. She never called him "daddy," now. "No, I'm
    </p>
    <p>
     sorry to hear it. What's gone wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked at her a moment before replying, as though to gauge her mind
    </p>
    <p>
     and the effect his announcement might have. Very charming she looked,
    </p>
    <p>
     that evening, in a crÃªpe de Chine gown with three-quarter lace sleeves
    </p>
    <p>
     and an Oriental girdle--a wonderful Nile-green creation, very simple
    </p>
    <p>
     (she had told herself) yet of staggering cost. A single white rose
    </p>
    <p>
     graced her hair. The low-cut neck of the gown revealed a full, strong
    </p>
    <p>
     bosom. Around her throat she wore a fine gold chain, with a French
    </p>
    <p>
     20-franc piece and her Vassar Phi Beta Kappa key attached--the only
    </p>
    <p>
     pendants she cared for. The gold coin spoke to her of the land of her
    </p>
    <p>
     far ancestry, a land oft visited by her and greatly loved; the gold key
    </p>
    <p>
     reminded her of college, and high rank taken in studies there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Flint noted some of these details as he sat looking at her across
    </p>
    <p>
     the white and gleaming table, where silver and gold plate, cut glass and
    </p>
    <p>
     flowers and fine SÃ¨vres china all combined to make a picture of splendor
    </p>
    <p>
     such as the average workingman or his wife has never even dreamed of or
    </p>
    <p>
     imagined; a picture the merest commonplace, however, to Flint and
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A devilish fine-looking girl!" thought he, eyeing his daughter with
    </p>
    <p>
     approval. "She'd grace any board in the world, whether billionaire's or
    </p>
    <p>
     prince's! Waldron, old man, you'll never be able to thank me
    </p>
    <p>
     sufficiently for what I'm going to do for you tonight--never, that is,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless you help me make the Air Trust the staggering success I think you
    </p>
    <p>
     can, and give me the boost I need to land the whole damned world as my
    </p>
    <p>
     own private property!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He chuckled dryly to himself, then drew the paper from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, father, what's gone wrong?" asked Kale, again. "Your
    </p>
    <p>
     disappointment--what was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She spoke without animation, tonelessly, in a flat, even voice. Since
    </p>
    <p>
     that night when her father had tried to force Waldron upon her, and had
    </p>
    <p>
     taunted her with loving the vagabond (as he said) who had rescued her,
    </p>
    <p>
     something seemed to have been broken, in her manner; some spring of
    </p>
    <p>
     action had snapped; some force was lacking now.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's wrong with me?" asked Flint, trying to veil the secret malice
    </p>
    <p>
     and keen satisfaction that underlay his speech. "Oh, just this. You
    </p>
    <p>
     remember about a week ago, when we--ah--had that little talk in the
    </p>
    <p>
     music room--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't, father, please!" she begged, raising one strong, brown hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't bring that up again. It's all over and done with, that matter is.
    </p>
    <p>
     I beg you, don't re-open it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I--you misunderstand me, my dear child," said Flint, trying to smile,
    </p>
    <p>
     but only flashing his gold tooth. "At that time I told you I was looking
    </p>
    <p>
     for, and would reward, if found, the--er--man who had been so brave and
    </p>
    <p>
     quick-witted as to rescue you. You remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Really, father, I beg you not to--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not, pray?" requested Flint, gazing at her through his pince-nez.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My intentions, I assure you, were most honest and philanthropic. If I
    </p>
    <p>
     had found him--_then_--I'd have given him--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, but he wouldn't have taken anything, you see!" the girl
    </p>
    <p>
     interrupted, with some spirit. "I told you that, at the time. It's just
    </p>
    <p>
     as true, now. So please, father, let's drop the question altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm sorry not to be able to grant your request, my dear," said the old
    </p>
    <p>
     man, with hidden malice. "But really, this time, you must hear me. My
    </p>
    <p>
     disappointment arises from the fact that I've just discovered the young
    </p>
    <p>
     man's identity, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You--you have?" Kate exclaimed, grasping the edge of the table with a
    </p>
    <p>
     nervous hand. Her father smiled again, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I have," said he, with slow emphasis, "and I regret to say, my
    </p>
    <p>
     dear child, that my diagnosis of his character is precisely what I first
    </p>
    <p>
     thought. Any interest you may feel in that quarter is being applied to a
    </p>
    <p>
     very unworthy object. The man is one of my discharged employees, a
    </p>
    <p>
     thorough rascal and hard ticket in every way--one of the lowest-bred and
    </p>
    <p>
     most villainous persons yet unhung, I grieve to state. The fact that he
    </p>
    <p>
     carried you in his arms, and that I owe your preservation to him, is one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the bitterest facts in my life. Had it been any other man, no matter
    </p>
    <p>
     of what humble birth--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Father!" she cried, bending forward and gazing at him with strange
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes. "Father! By what right and on what authority do you make these
    </p>
    <p>
     accusations? That man, I know, was all that innate gentleness and
    </p>
    <p>
     upright manhood could make any man. His nobility was not of wealth or
    </p>
    <p>
     title, but of--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nonsense!" Flint interrupted. "Nobility, eh? Read _that_, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Leering, despite himself, he handed the paper across the table to his
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Those marked passages," said he. "And remember, this is only the
    </p>
    <p>
     beginning. Wait till all the facts are known, the whole conspiracy laid
    </p>
    <p>
     bare and everything exposed to public view! _Then_ tell me, if you can,
    </p>
    <p>
     that he is poor but noble! Bah! Sunday-school dope, that! Noble, yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine sat there staring at the paper, a minute, as though quite
    </p>
    <p>
     unable to decipher a word. Through a kind of wavering mist that seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to swim before her eyes, she vaguely saw the words: "Socialist White
    </p>
    <p>
     Slaver!" but that these bore any relation to the man she remembered,
    </p>
    <p>
     back there at the sugar-house, had not yet occurred to her mind. She
    </p>
    <p>
     simply could not grasp the significance of the glaring headlines. And,
    </p>
    <p>
     turning a blank gaze on her father's face, she stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why--why do you give me this? What has this got to do with--_me_? With
    </p>
    <p>
     _him_?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Everything!" snarled the Billionaire, violently irritated by his
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter's seeming obtuseness. "Everything, I tell you! That man, that
    </p>
    <p>
     strong and noble hero of yours, is this man! This white slaver! This
    </p>
    <p>
     wild beast--this Socialist--this Anarchist! Do you understand now, or
    </p>
    <p>
     don't you? Do you grasp the truth at last, or is your mind incapable of
    </p>
    <p>
     apprehending it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He had risen, and now was standing there at his side of the table,
    </p>
    <p>
     shaking with violent emotion, his glasses awry, face wrinkled and drawn,
    </p>
    <p>
     hands twitching. His daughter, making no answer to his taunts, sat with
    </p>
    <p>
     the paper spread before her on the table. A wine glass, overset, had
    </p>
    <p>
     spilled a red stain--for all the world like the workers' blood, spilled
    </p>
    <p>
     in war and industry for the greater wealth and glory of the masters--out
    </p>
    <p>
     across the costly damask, but neither she nor Flint paid any heed.
    </p>
    <p>
     For he was staring only at her; and she, now having mastered herself a
    </p>
    <p>
     little, though her full breast still rose and fell too quickly, was
    </p>
    <p>
     struggling to read the slanderous lies and foul libels of the
    </p>
    <p>
     blue-penciled article.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silently she read, paling a little but otherwise giving no sign to show
    </p>
    <p>
     her father how the tide of her thought was setting. Twice over she read
    </p>
    <p>
     the article; then, pushing the paper back, looked at old Flint with eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     that seemed to question his very soul--eyes that saw the living truth,
    </p>
    <p>
     below.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is a lie!" said she, at last, in a grave, quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?" blurted the old man. "A--a lie?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said she. "A lie."
    </p>
    <p>
     Furious, he ripped open the paper, and once more shoved it at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fool!" cried he. "Read _that_!" And his shaking, big-knuckled finger
    </p>
    <p>
     tapped the editorial on "Socialism Unveiled."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," she answered, "I need read no more. I know; I understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You--you know _what_?" choked Flint. "This is an editorial, I tell you!
    </p>
    <p>
     It represents the best thought and the most careful opinion of the
    </p>
    <p>
     paper. And it condemns this man, absolutely, as a criminal and a menace
    </p>
    <p>
     to society. It denounces him and his whole gang of Socialists or
    </p>
    <p>
     Anarchists or White-slavers--they're all the same thing--as a plague to
    </p>
    <p>
     the world. That's the editor's opinion; and remember, he's on the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground, there. He has all the facts. You--_you_ are at a distance, and
    </p>
    <p>
     have none! Yet you set up your futile, childish opinion--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No more, father! No more!" cried Catherine, also standing up. She faced
    </p>
    <p>
     him calmly, coldly, magnificently. "You can't talk to me this way, any
    </p>
    <p>
     more. Cannot, and must not! As I see this thing--and my woman's
    </p>
    <p>
     intuition tells me more in a minute than you can explain away in an
    </p>
    <p>
     hour--this fabrication here has all, or nearly all, been invented and
    </p>
    <p>
     carried out by you. For what reason? This--to discredit this man! To
    </p>
    <p>
     make me hate and loathe him! To force me back to Waldron. To--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stop!" shouted the old man, in a well-assumed passion. "No daughter of
    </p>
    <p>
     mine shall talk to me this way! Silence! It is monstrous and
    </p>
    <p>
     unthinkable. It--it is horrible beyond belief! Silence, I tell
    </p>
    <p>
     you--and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, father, not silence," she replied, with perfect poise. "Not
    </p>
    <p>
     silence now, but speech. Either this thing is true or it is false. In
    </p>
    <p>
     either case, I must know the facts. The papers? No truth in _those_! The
    </p>
    <p>
     finding of the courts? today, they are a by-word and a mockery! All I
    </p>
    <p>
     can trust is the evidence of my own senses; what I hear, and feel, and
    </p>
    <p>
     see. So then--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then?" gulped the Billionaire, holding the back of his chair in a
    </p>
    <p>
     trembling grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just this, father. I'm going to Rochester, myself, to investigate this
    </p>
    <p>
     thing, to see this man, to hear his side of the story, to know--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do that," cried Flint in a terrible voice, "and you never enter these
    </p>
    <p>
     doors again! From the minute you leave Idle Hour on that fool's errand,
    </p>
    <p>
     my daughter is dead to me, forever!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Swept clean off his feet by rage, as well as by the deadly fear of what
    </p>
    <p>
     might happen if his daughter really were to learn the truth, he had lost
    </p>
    <p>
     his head completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     With quiet attention, the girl regarded him, then smiled inscrutably.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So it be," she replied. "Even though you disinherit me or turn me off
    </p>
    <p>
     with a penny, my mind is made up, and my duty's clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "While things like these are going on in the world, outside, I have no
    </p>
    <p>
     right to linger and to idle here. I am no child, now; I have been
    </p>
    <p>
     thinking of late, reading, learning. Though I can't see it all clearly,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet, I know that every bite we eat, means deprivation to some other
    </p>
    <p>
     people, somewhere. This light and luxury mean poverty and darkness
    </p>
    <p>
     elsewhere. This fruit, this wine, this very bread is ours because some
    </p>
    <p>
     obscure and unknown men have toiled and sweat and given them to us. Even
    </p>
    <p>
     this cut glass on our table--see! What tragedies it could reveal, could
    </p>
    <p>
     it but speak! What tales of coughing, consumptive glass-cutters, bending
    </p>
    <p>
     over wheels, their lungs cut to pieces by the myriad spicules of sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     glass, so that we, we of our class, may enjoy beauty of design and
    </p>
    <p>
     coloring! And the silken gown I wear--that too has cost--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No more! No more of this!" gurgled old Flint, now nearly in apoplexy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I deny you! I repudiate you, Anarchist that you are! Go! Never come
    </p>
    <p>
     back--never, never--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Stumbling blindly, he turned and staggered out of the room. She watched
    </p>
    <p>
     him go, nor tried to steady his uncertain steps. In the hallway,
    </p>
    <p>
     outside, she heard him ring for Slawson, heard the valet come, and both
    </p>
    <p>
     of them ascend the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Father," she whispered to herself, a look of great and pure spiritual
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty on her noble face, "father, this had to come. Sooner or later, it
    </p>
    <p>
     was inevitable. Whatever you have done, I forgive you, for you _are_ my
    </p>
    <p>
     father, and have surely acted for what you think my interest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But none the less, the end is here and now. Between you and me, a great
    </p>
    <p>
     gulf is fixed. And from tonight I face the world, to battle with it,
    </p>
    <p>
     learn from it, and know the truth in every way. Enough of this false,
    </p>
    <p>
     easy, unnatural life. I cannot live it any longer; it would crush and
    </p>
    <p>
     stifle me! Enough! I must be free, I shall be free, to know, and dare,
    </p>
    <p>
     and do!"
    </p>
    <p>
     That night, having had no further speech with old Flint, Kate left Idle
    </p>
    <p>
     Hour, taking just a few necessities in a suit-case, and a few dollars
    </p>
    <p>
     for her immediate needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Giving no explanation to maid, valet or anyone, she let herself out,
    </p>
    <p>
     walked through the great estate and down Englewood Avenue, to the
    </p>
    <p>
     station, where she caught a train for Jersey City.
    </p>
    <p>
     The midnight special for Chicago bore her swiftly westward. No sleeping
    </p>
    <p>
     car she took, but passed the night in a seat of an ordinary coach. Her
    </p>
    <p>
     ticket read "Rochester."
    </p>
    <p>
     The old page of her Book of Life was closed forever. A new and better
    </p>
    <p>
     page was open wide.
    </p>
   </div>

     CHAPTER XXV.
    </head>
    <p>
     THROUGH STEEL BARS.
    </p>
    <p>
     True to her plan, Catherine ended her journey at Rochester. She engaged
    </p>
    <p>
     a room at a second-rate hotel--marvelling greatly at the meanness of the
    </p>
    <p>
     accommodations, the like of which she had never seen--and, at ten
    </p>
    <p>
     o'clock of the morning, appeared at the Central Police Station. The
    </p>
    <p>
     bundle of papers in her hand indicated that she had read the latest lies
    </p>
    <p>
     and venom poured out on Gabriel's defenseless head.
    </p>
    <p>
     The haughty, full-fed sergeant in charge of the station made some
    </p>
    <p>
     objections, at first, to letting her see Gabriel; but the tone of her
    </p>
    <p>
     voice and the level look of her gray eye presently convinced him he was
    </p>
    <p>
     playing with fire, and he gave in. Summoning an officer, he bade the man
    </p>
    <p>
     conduct her. Iron doors opened and closed for her. She was conscious of
    </p>
    <p>
     long, ill-smelling, concrete-floored corridors, with little steel cages
    </p>
    <p>
     at either side--cages where hopeless, sodden wrecks of men were
    </p>
    <p>
     standing, or sitting in attitudes of brutal despair, or lying on foul
    </p>
    <p>
     bunks, motionless and inert as logs.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment her heart failed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good Lord! Can such things be?" she whispered to herself. "So
    </p>
    <p>
     this--this is a police station? And real jails and penitentiaries are
    </p>
    <p>
     worse? Oh, horrible! I never dreamed of anything like this, or any men
    </p>
    <p>
     like these!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The officer, stopping at a cell-door and banging thereon with some
    </p>
    <p>
     keys, startled her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here, youse," he addressed the man within, "lady to see youse!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine was conscious that her heart was pounding hard and her breath
    </p>
    <p>
     coming fast, as she peered in through those cold, harsh metal bars. For
    </p>
    <p>
     a minute she could find no thought, no word. Within, her eyes--still
    </p>
    <p>
     unaccustomed to the gloom--vaguely perceived a man's figure, big and
    </p>
    <p>
     powerful, and different in its bearing from those other cringing
    </p>
    <p>
     wretches she had glimpsed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the man came toward her, stopped, peered and for a second drew
    </p>
    <p>
     back. And then--then she heard his voice, in a kind of startled joy:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh--is it--is it _you_?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," she answered. "I must see you! I must talk with you, again, and
    </p>
    <p>
     know the truth!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The officer edged nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Youse can talk all y' want to," he dictated, hoarsely, "but don't you
    </p>
    <p>
     pass nothin' in. No dope, nor nothin', see? I'll stick around an' watch,
    </p>
    <p>
     anyhow; but don't try to slip him no dream powders or no 'snow.' 'Cause
    </p>
    <p>
     if you do--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What--what _on_ earth are you talking about?" the girl demanded,
    </p>
    <p>
     turning on the officer with absolute astonishment. But he, only winking
    </p>
    <p>
     wisely, repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
     "You heard me, didn't you? No dope. I'm wise to this whole game."
    </p>
    <p>
     At a loss for his meaning, yet without any real desire to fathom it,
    </p>
    <p>
     Kate turned back toward Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
     A moment they two looked at each other, each noting any change that
    </p>
    <p>
     might have taken place since that wonderful hour in the sugar-house,
    </p>
    <p>
     each hungering and thirsting for a sight of the other's face. In her
    </p>
    <p>
     heart, already Kate knew as well as she knew she was alive, that this
    </p>
    <p>
     man was totally innocent of the foul charges heaped upon him. And so she
    </p>
    <p>
     looked at him with eyes wherein lay no reproach, no doubt and no
    </p>
    <p>
     suspicion. And, as she looked, tears started, and her heart swelled
    </p>
    <p>
     hotly in her breast; for he was bruised and battered and a helpless
    </p>
    <p>
     captive.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He, caged like a trapped animal!" her thought was. "He, so strong, and
    </p>
    <p>
     free, and brave! Oh, horrible, horrible!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He must have read something of this feeling, in her face; for now,
    </p>
    <p>
     coming close to the bars, he said in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Girl--your name I don't know, even yet--girl, you mustn't pity me!
    </p>
    <p>
     That's _one_ thing I can't have. I'm here because the master class is
    </p>
    <p>
     stronger than my class, the working class. Here, because I'm dangerous
    </p>
    <p>
     to that master class. This isn't said to make myself out a martyr. It's
    </p>
    <p>
     only to make you see things right. I'm not complaining at this plight.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've richly earned it--under Capitalism. So, then, _that's_ settled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And now, what's more important, tell me how _you_ are! And did your
    </p>
    <p>
     wound cause you much trouble? I confess I've passed many an anxious
    </p>
    <p>
     hour, thinking of your narrow escape and of your injury. It wasn't too
    </p>
    <p>
     bad, was it? Tell me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," she answered, still holding to the bars, for she somehow felt
    </p>
    <p>
     quite unaccountably weak. "It wasn't very bad. There's hardly any scar
    </p>
    <p>
     at all--or won't be, when it's fully healed. But all this is trifling,
    </p>
    <p>
     compared to what _you've_ suffered and are suffering. Oh, what a
    </p>
    <p>
     horrible affair! What frightful accusations! Tell me the truth,
    </p>
    <p>
     Boy--how, why could--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked at her a moment, in silence, noting her splendid hair and eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     and mouth, the firm, well-moulded chin, the confident and self-reliant
    </p>
    <p>
     poise of the shapely head; and as he looked, he knew he loved this
    </p>
    <p>
     woman. He understood, at last, how dear she was to him--dearer than
    </p>
    <p>
     anything else in all the world save just his principles and stern life
    </p>
    <p>
     work. He comprehended the meaning of all, his dreams and visions and
    </p>
    <p>
     long thoughts. And, caring nothing for consequences, unskilled in the
    </p>
    <p>
     finesse of dealing with women, acting wholly on the irresistible
    </p>
    <p>
     impulses of a heart that overflowed, he looked deep into those gray eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     and said in a tone that set her heart-strings vibrating:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Listen! The truth? How could I tell you anything else? I know not who
    </p>
    <p>
     you are, and care not. That you are rich and powerful and free, while I
    </p>
    <p>
     am poor and in captivity, means nothing. Love cares not for such
    </p>
    <p>
     trifles. It dares all, hopes all, trusts all, believes all--and is
    </p>
    <p>
     patient in adversity."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Love?" she whispered, her face paling. "How do you dare to--?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dare? Because my heart bids me. And where it bids, I care not for
    </p>
    <p>
     conventions or consequences!" He flung his hand out with a splendid
    </p>
    <p>
     gesture, his head high, his eyes lustrous in the half-light of the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where it leads, I have to follow. That is why I am a Socialist! That is
    </p>
    <p>
     why I am here, today, outcast and execrated, a prisoner, in danger of
    </p>
    <p>
     long years of living death in the pestilential tomb of some foul
    </p>
    <p>
     penitentiary!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're here because--because you are a Socialist?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said he. "I tried to help a suffering, outcast woman--or one who
    </p>
    <p>
     posed as such. And she betrayed me to my enemies. And so--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There _was_ a woman in this affair, then?" Catherine queried with
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden pain. "The newspapers haven't made the story _all_ up out of
    </p>
    <p>
     whole cloth?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No. There _was_ a woman. A Delilah, who delivered me into the hands of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Philistines, when I tried to help her in what she lied in telling me
    </p>
    <p>
     was her need. Will you hear the story?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Still very pale, she formed a half-inarticulate "Yes!" with her full
    </p>
    <p>
     lips. Then, seeming to brace herself by a tighter clasp on the hard
    </p>
    <p>
     steel grating, she listened while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Earnestly, honestly and with perfect straightforwardness, omitting
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing, adding nothing, he gave her the narrative of that fatal night's
    </p>
    <p>
     events, from the first moment he had laid eyes on the
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderfully-disguised woman, till her cudgel-blow had laid him senseless
    </p>
    <p>
     on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     He told her the part that every actor therein had played; how the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     drama had been staged, to dishonor and convict him, to railroad him to
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pen for a long term, perhaps to kill him. He spoke in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
     to prevent the watching officer from overhearing; and as he talked, he
    </p>
    <p>
     thanked his stars that in all this network of conspiracy and crime
    </p>
    <p>
     against the Party and against himself, his captors had not yet placed
    </p>
    <p>
     him incommunicado. For some reason--perhaps because they thought their
    </p>
    <p>
     case against him absolutely secure and wanted to avoid any appearance of
    </p>
    <p>
     unfairness or of martyrizing him--this restriction had not yet been laid
    </p>
    <p>
     upon him. So now his message of the truth could reach the ears of her
    </p>
    <p>
     who, more than all the world beside, had grown dear to him and precious
    </p>
    <p>
     beyond words.
    </p>
    <p>
     He told her, then, not only the story of that night, but also all that
    </p>
    <p>
     had since happened--the newspaper attacks on him and on the Party; the
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberate attempt to poison the community and the nation against him;
    </p>
    <p>
     the struggle to fix a foul and lasting blot upon his name, and ruin him
    </p>
    <p>
     beyond redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And why, all this?" he added, while she--listening so intently that she
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly breathed--knew that he spoke the living, vital truth. "Why this
    </p>
    <p>
     persecution, this plotting, this labor and expense to 'get' me. Do you
    </p>
    <p>
     want to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, tell me!" she whispered. "I don't understand. I can't! It--it all
    </p>
    <p>
     seems so horrible, so unreal, so--so different from what I've always
    </p>
    <p>
     believed about the majesty and purity of the law! Can these things be,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He laughed bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can they?" he repeated. "When you see that they _are_, isn't that
    </p>
    <p>
     answer enough? And the reason of it all is that I'm a Socialist and know
    </p>
    <p>
     certain secrets of certain men, which--if I should tell the
    </p>
    <p>
     world--might, nay, surely would precipitate a revolution. So, these men,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the System behind them, have tried to discredit me by this foul
    </p>
    <p>
     charge. After this, if the charge sticks, I may shout my head off,
    </p>
    <p>
     exposing what I know; and who will listen? You know the answer as well
    </p>
    <p>
     as I! Do I complain? No, not once! What I must suffer, for this
    </p>
    <p>
     wondrous Cause, is not a tenth what thousands suffer every day, in
    </p>
    <p>
     silence and high courage. What has happened to me, personally, is but
    </p>
    <p>
     the merest trifle beside what has already happened to thousands,
    </p>
    <p>
     fighting for life and liberty, for wife and home and children; for the
    </p>
    <p>
     right to work and live like men, not beasts!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean the--the working class?" she ventured, wonderingly. "Is this
    </p>
    <p>
     outrage really a minor one, compared with what they, who feed and warm
    </p>
    <p>
     and carry the whole world, have to suffer? Tell me, for I--God help me,
    </p>
    <p>
     I am ignorant! I am beginning to see, to half-see, awful, dim, ghostly
    </p>
    <p>
     shapes of huge, unspeakable wrongs. Tell me the truth about all this, as
    </p>
    <p>
     you have told it about yourself--and let me know!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Gabriel talked as never he had talked before. To this, his audience
    </p>
    <p>
     of one, there in the dirty and ill-smelling police station, he unfolded
    </p>
    <p>
     the sad tale of the disinherited, the enslaved, the wretched, as never
    </p>
    <p>
     to a huge, and spell-bound audience in hall or park or city street. His
    </p>
    <p>
     eloquence, always convincing, now became sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
     With master strokes he painted vast outlines of the whole sad
    </p>
    <p>
     picture--the System based on robbery and fraud and exploitation; its
    </p>
    <p>
     natural results in millionaire and tramp and harlot and degenerate; the
    </p>
    <p>
     crime of armies of unemployed and starving men, of millions of women
    </p>
    <p>
     forced into the factories and shops, there to compete with men and lower
    </p>
    <p>
     wages and lose their finest feminine attributes in the sordid and
    </p>
    <p>
     heartless drudging for a pittance.
    </p>
    <p>
     He told her of child slavery, and brought before her eyes the pictures
    </p>
    <p>
     he himself had seen, of the pale, stunted little victims of Mammon's
    </p>
    <p>
     greed, toiling by day and night in stifling, dangerous mines; in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell-glare of the glass-factories; in the hand-bruising,
    </p>
    <p>
     soul-obliterating Inferno of the coal-breakers; in the hot, linty,
    </p>
    <p>
     sickening atmosphere of the southern cotton-mills. And as he talked, she
    </p>
    <p>
     saw for the first time the figures of these bowed and bloodless little
    </p>
    <p>
     boys and girls, giving their lives drop by drop, and cough by cough,
    </p>
    <p>
     that _she_ might have purple and fine linen and the rich, soft, easy
    </p>
    <p>
     paths of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     *       *       *       *       *
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, pausing not, he spoke to her of white slavery, of girls and women
    </p>
    <p>
     by the uncounted thousand forced to barter their own bodies for a
    </p>
    <p>
     mockery of life; and, stinging as a nagaika, he laid the lash of blame
    </p>
    <p>
     on Capitalism, evil cause of an evil and rotten fruit, of disease and
    </p>
    <p>
     crime, and misery, and death. He told her of political corruption beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     belief; of cheating, lying, trickery and greed, for power. Of war, he
    </p>
    <p>
     told her, and made all its inner, hideous motives clear. She seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     verily to see the trenches, the "red rampart's slippery edge," the
    </p>
    <p>
     spattered blood and brains and all the horror of Hell's nethermost
    </p>
    <p>
     infamy--and then the blasted, wrecked and wasted homes, the long trail
    </p>
    <p>
     of mourning and of hopeless ruin--the horror of this crime of crimes,
    </p>
    <p>
     all for profit, all for gold and markets, all for Capitalism!
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, while the girl stood there listening, spell-bound by her first
    </p>
    <p>
     insight, her first understanding of the true character of this, our
    </p>
    <p>
     striving, slaving world, held by a few for their own inordinate pride
    </p>
    <p>
     and power, the man's voice changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     With new intonations and a deeper tone, he launched into some outlines
    </p>
    <p>
     of the great hope, the splendid vision, the Wondrous Ideal--Socialism,
    </p>
    <p>
     the world-salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sentence by sentence, imagery of this vast, noble thought flowed from
    </p>
    <p>
     his inspired lips. Clearly he showed this woman all the causes of the
    </p>
    <p>
     world's travail and pain; and clearly made her see that only in one way,
    </p>
    <p>
     only through the ownership of the world by the world's children as a
    </p>
    <p>
     whole, could peace and justice, life and joy and plenty and the New Time
    </p>
    <p>
     come to pass, dreamed of and yearned for by many sages and prophets, and
    </p>
    <p>
     now close at hand on the very threshold of reality!
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialism! It leaped from his spirit like a living flame, consuming
    </p>
    <p>
     dross and waste and evil, lighting up the future with its shining
    </p>
    <p>
     beacon, its message of hope to the hopeless, of rest and cheer and peace
    </p>
    <p>
     to all who labored and were heavy laden.
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialism! The glory of the vision seemed to blind and dazzle Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
     In its supernal light, things grievous to be understood and borne were
    </p>
    <p>
     now made clear. For the first time in all her life, the woman saw, and
    </p>
    <p>
     knew, and grasped the truths of this strange nexus of conflict, pain and
    </p>
    <p>
     sorrow, that we know as our existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Socialism! The Hope of the World!" Gabriel finished. "And for this, and
    </p>
    <p>
     for what I know about its enemies, I stand here in this cell and may yet
    </p>
    <p>
     go to a living death. This is my crime, and nothing else--this battle
    </p>
    <p>
     for the freedom and the joy of the world--this struggle against the
    </p>
    <p>
     powers of ignorance and darkness, priestcraft and greed, lust, treachery
    </p>
    <p>
     and foulness, cruelty and hate and war! This, and this only. You have
    </p>
    <p>
     heard me. I have spoken!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He fell silent, crossed his arms upon the bars of the cage that pent
    </p>
    <p>
     him, and laid his head upon them with a motion of weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something strangely stirred the heart of the woman. Her hand went out
    </p>
    <p>
     and touched his thick, black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be of good cheer," she whispered. "Though I am ignorant and do not
    </p>
    <p>
     fully understand, as yet, some glimmer of the light has reached my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can learn, and I _will_ learn, and dare, and do! All my life I have
    </p>
    <p>
     eaten the bread of this bitter slavery, taken the thing I had no right
    </p>
    <p>
     to take, unknowingly wielded the lash on bleeding backs of men and women
    </p>
    <p>
     and children.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All my life have I, in ignorance and idleness, done these things. But
    </p>
    <p>
     never shall I do them again. That is all past and gone, an evil dream
    </p>
    <p>
     that is no more. From now, if you will be patient and forgive and teach
    </p>
    <p>
     me, I will stand with you and yours, and glory in the new-found strength
    </p>
    <p>
     and majesty of this supreme ideal!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He made no answer, save to reach one hand to her, through the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their hands met in a long, clinging tension. The policeman, somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     down the corridor, moved officiously in their direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here, now, none o' that!" he blurted. "Break away! An' say, time's up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yuh stayed too long, miss, as it is!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Their hands parted. Still Gabriel did not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are--are you coming back again?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, Gabriel. Tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And will you tell me then who you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll tell you now, if you want to know."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do," he answered, and raised his head. Their eyes met, steadily. "I
    </p>
    <p>
     do, now that you too have seen the light, and that you understand. Tell
    </p>
    <p>
     me, who are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     A moment's pause.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, facing him, she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am Catherine Flint, only daughter of Isaac Flint, the Billionaire!"
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     CHAPTER XXVI.
    </head>
    <p>
     "GUILTY."
    </p>
    <p>
     Speechless and dazed, Gabriel stared at her as though at some strange
    </p>
    <p>
     apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Daughter of--of Isaac Flint?" he stammered, clinging to the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come, come, lady, yuh can't stay no longer!" the officer again
    </p>
    <p>
     insisted, tapping her on the shoulder. "Yuh'd oughta been out o' here
    </p>
    <p>
     ten minutes ago! No, nuthin' doin'!" he concluded, as she turned to him
    </p>
    <p>
     appealingly. "Not today! Time's up an' more than up!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine stretched out her hand to Gabriel, in farewell. He took it,
    </p>
    <p>
     silently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good-bye!" said she. "Until I come again, good-bye. Keep up a stout
    </p>
    <p>
     heart, for I am with you. We--we _can't_ lose. We shall win--we _must_
    </p>
    <p>
     win! Don't condemn me for being what I am and who I am, Gabriel. Only
    </p>
    <p>
     think what--with your help--I may yet be! And now again, good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Their hands parted. Gabriel, still silent, stood there in his cell,
    </p>
    <p>
     watching her till she vanished from his sight down the long corridor of
    </p>
    <p>
     grief and tears. The officer, winking wisely to himself, thrust his
    </p>
    <p>
     tongue into his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Daughter of Isaac Flint, th' Billionaire!" he was thinking, with
    </p>
    <p>
     derision. "Oh, yes, billionaires' daughters would be visitin' Socialists
    </p>
    <p>
     an' bums an' red-light con-workers like this geezer. Oh yes, sure, sure
    </p>
    <p>
     they would--I should worry!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Which mental attitude was fortunate, indeed; for it, and it alone,
    </p>
    <p>
     preserved the girl from a wild blare of newspaper notoriety. Had the
    </p>
    <p>
     truth been known, who could have imagined the results?
    </p>
    <p>
     For a long time after the girl had departed, Gabriel sat there in his
    </p>
    <p>
     cell, motionless and sunk in deepest thought. His emotions passed
    </p>
    <p>
     recording. That this woman, his ideal, his best-beloved, the cherished,
    </p>
    <p>
     inmost treasure of his heart and soul--she whom he had rescued, she who
    </p>
    <p>
     had lain in his arms and shared with him that unforgettable hour in the
    </p>
    <p>
     old sugar-house--should now prove to be the daughter of his bitterest
    </p>
    <p>
     enemy, surpassed belief and stunned all clear understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint! The very name connoted, for Gabriel, all that was cruel and
    </p>
    <p>
     rapacious, hateful, vicious and greedy; all that meant pain and woe and
    </p>
    <p>
     death to him and his class. Visions of West Virginia and Colorado rose
    </p>
    <p>
     before his mind. He heard again the whistle of the "Bull Moose Death
    </p>
    <p>
     Special" as it sped on its swift errand of barbarism up Cabin Creek,
    </p>
    <p>
     hurling its sprays of leaden death among the slaves of this man and his
    </p>
    <p>
     vulturine associates.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint! He whispered the name; and now he seemed to see the burning tents
    </p>
    <p>
     at Ludlow; the fleeing women and children, shot down by barbarous thugs
    </p>
    <p>
     and gunmen, ghouls in human form! He saw the pits of death, where the
    </p>
    <p>
     charred bodies of innocent victims of greed and heartless rapacity lay
    </p>
    <p>
     in mute protest under the far Colorado sky. And more he saw, east and
    </p>
    <p>
     west, north and south, of this man's inhuman work; and his thoughts,
    </p>
    <p>
     projected into the future, dwelt bitterly on the Air Trust now already
    </p>
    <p>
     under way--the terrible, coming slavery which he, Gabriel, had struggled
    </p>
    <p>
     to checkmate, only to find himself locked like a rat in a steel trap!
    </p>
    <p>
     "And this woman," he groaned in agony of soul, "this woman, all in all
    </p>
    <p>
     to me, is--is _his_ daughter!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flinging himself upon his hard and narrow bunk, he buried his head in
    </p>
    <p>
     his powerful arms, and tried to blot out thought from his fevered brain;
    </p>
    <p>
     but still the current ran on and on and on, endlessly, maddeningly. And
    </p>
    <p>
     to the problem, no answer seemed to come.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She must know who I am," he pondered. "Even if her father has not told
    </p>
    <p>
     her, the papers have. True, she doesn't believe the infamous charge
    </p>
    <p>
     against me; but what then? Can she, on the other hand, believe the
    </p>
    <p>
     truth, that her father has conspired with Slade and those Cosmos thugs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and with the press and courts and the whole damnable prostituted system,
    </p>
    <p>
     to suppress and kill me?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can she believe her father guilty of all that? And of all the horrors
    </p>
    <p>
     of this capitalist Hell, that I have told her about? No! Human nature is
    </p>
    <p>
     incapable of such vast turnings from all the habits and environments of
    </p>
    <p>
     a lifetime. In her veins flows the blood of that arch-criminal, Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts must be, to some extent, his thoughts. She must share his
    </p>
    <p>
     viewpoint, and be loyal to him. After this first flush of reaction
    </p>
    <p>
     against her father, she will go back to him. It is inevitable. Betwixt
    </p>
    <p>
     her and me is fixed a boundless space, wider than Heaven and earth. She
    </p>
    <p>
     is one pole, and I the other. If I have any strength or resolution or
    </p>
    <p>
     philosophy, now is the hour for its trial.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This woman must be, shall be put away from every thought and wish and
    </p>
    <p>
     hope. And the word FINIS must be written at the end of the one brief
    </p>
    <p>
     chapter where our life-stories seem to have run along together in a
    </p>
    <p>
     false harmony and a fictitious peace!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus pondered Gabriel, in the gloom of his harsh cell, branded with
    </p>
    <p>
     crime and writhing in the agony of soul that only those who love
    </p>
    <p>
     hopelessly can ever know.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Catherine, what of her? What were her thoughts, emotions,
    </p>
    <p>
     inspirations as--seeming to live in a dream, with Gabriel's eloquence
    </p>
    <p>
     and the new vision of a better, saner, kindlier world shining through
    </p>
    <p>
     her soul--she made her way back to the dingy hotel where now, shabby as
    </p>
    <p>
     it was, she felt she had no right to stay, while others, homeless,
    </p>
    <p>
     walked the brutal streets?
    </p>
    <p>
     Who shall know them? Who shall tell? A blind man, suddenly made to see,
    </p>
    <p>
     can find no words to express the wonder and bright glory of that sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     sight. A deaf man, regaining his lost sense, cannot describe the sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     burst of sound that fills the new, strange world wherein he finds
    </p>
    <p>
     himself. So, now, this cultured, gently bred woman, for the first time
    </p>
    <p>
     in her life understanding the facts, glimpsing the tragedy and grasping
    </p>
    <p>
     the answer to it all, felt that no words could compass her strange
    </p>
    <p>
     exultation and enlargement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It--it's like a chrysalis emerging into the form of a light, swift
    </p>
    <p>
     butterfly!" she pondered, as, back in her room once more, she prepared
    </p>
    <p>
     to write two letters. "Just for the present, I can't understand it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't know, yet, whether I'm worthy to be a Socialist, to be one of
    </p>
    <p>
     that company of earnest, noble men and women striving for life and
    </p>
    <p>
     liberty and joy for all the world. But with the help of the man I trust
    </p>
    <p>
     and honor and believe in, and--and love--perhaps I may yet be. God
    </p>
    <p>
     grant it may be so!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She thought, a few minutes more, her face lighted by an inner radiance
    </p>
    <p>
     that made its beauty spiritual and pure and calm. Then, having somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     composed her thoughts, she wrote this letter to Maxim Waldron:
    </p>
    <p>
     My Dear Wally:
    </p>
    <p>
     I am writing you without date or place, just as I shall write my
    </p>
    <p>
     father, because whatever happens, I insist that you two let me go
    </p>
    <p>
     my way in peace, without trying to find, or hamper, or importune
    </p>
    <p>
     me. My mind is fully made up. Nothing can change it. We have come
    </p>
    <p>
     to the parting of the ways, forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though I may feel bitterly toward you for what I now understand as
    </p>
    <p>
     your harsh and cruel attitude toward the world, and the rÃ´le you
    </p>
    <p>
     play as an exploiter of human labor, I shall not reproach you. You
    </p>
    <p>
     simply cannot see these things as I have come to see them since my
    </p>
    <p>
     feet have been set upon the road toward Socialism. Don't start,
    </p>
    <p>
     Wally--that's the truth. Perhaps I'm not much of a Socialist yet,
    </p>
    <p>
     because I don't know much about it. But I am learning, and shall
    </p>
    <p>
     learn. My teacher is the best one in the world, I'm sure; and added
    </p>
    <p>
     to this, all my natural energy and innate radicalism have flamed
    </p>
    <p>
     into activity with this new thought. So, you see, the past is even
    </p>
    <p>
     more effectively buried than ever. How could anything ever be
    </p>
    <p>
     possible, now, between you and me?
    </p>
    <p>
     Cease to think of me, Wally. I am gone out of your life, for all
    </p>
    <p>
     time, as out of that whole circle of false, insincere, wicked and
    </p>
    <p>
     parasitic existence that we call "society." That other world, where
    </p>
    <p>
     you still are, shall see me no more. I have found a better and a
    </p>
    <p>
     nobler kind of life; and to this, and to all it implies, I mean to
    </p>
    <p>
     be forever faithful. I beg you, never try to find me or to answer
    </p>
    <p>
     this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good-bye, then, forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
     After having read this over and sealed it, she wrote still another:
    </p>
    <p>
     Dear Father:
    </p>
    <p>
     It is hard to write these words to you. I owe you a debt of
    </p>
    <p>
     gratitude and love, in many ways; yet, after all, your will and
    </p>
    <p>
     mine conflict. You have tried to force me to a union abhorrent and
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible to me. My only course is this--independence to think,
    </p>
    <p>
     and act, and live as I, no longer a child but a grown woman, now
    </p>
    <p>
     see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
     I shall never return to you, father. Life means one thing to you,
    </p>
    <p>
     another to me. You cannot change; I would not, now, for all the
    </p>
    <p>
     world. I must go my way, thinking my own thoughts, doing my own
    </p>
    <p>
     work, living up to my own ideals, whatever these may be. Your money
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot lure me back to you, back to that old, false, sheltered,
    </p>
    <p>
     horrible life of ease and idleness and veiled robbery! The skill
    </p>
    <p>
     you have given me as a musician will open out a way for me to earn
    </p>
    <p>
     my own living and be free. For this I thank you, and for much else,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as I say good-bye to you for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have written Wally. He will tell you more about me, and about
    </p>
    <p>
     the change in my views and ambitions, which has taken place. Do not
    </p>
    <p>
     think harshly of me, father, and I will try to forgive you for the
    </p>
    <p>
     burden I now know you have laid upon the aching shoulders of this
    </p>
    <p>
     sad, old world.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, good-bye. Though you have lost a daughter, you may still
    </p>
    <p>
     rejoice to know that that daughter has found peace and joy and vast
    </p>
    <p>
     outlets for the energies of her whole heart and soul and being, in
    </p>
    <p>
     working for Socialism, the noblest ideal ever conceived by the mind
    </p>
    <p>
     of man.
    </p>
    <p>
     Farewell, father; and think sometimes, not too unkindly, of
    </p>
    <p>
     Your
    </p>
    <p>
     Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
     One week after these letters were mailed, "Tiger" Waldron, fanning the
    </p>
    <p>
     fires of the old man's terrible rage, had decided Flint to disinherit
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine and to name him, Waldron, as his executor. Gabriel's fervent
    </p>
    <p>
     wish that she might be penniless, was granted.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the very day this business was put through, practically delivering
    </p>
    <p>
     the Flint interests into Waldron's hands in the case of the old man's
    </p>
    <p>
     death, a verdict was reached in Gabriel's case, at Rochester.
    </p>
    <p>
     This case, crammed through the calendar, ahead of a large jam of other
    </p>
    <p>
     business, proved how well unlimited funds can grease the wheels of Law.
    </p>
    <p>
     It proved, also, that in the face of infinitely-subsidized witnesses,
    </p>
    <p>
     lawyers, judge and jurymen, black becomes white, and a good deed is
    </p>
    <p>
     written down a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine, working incognito, co-operated with the Socialist defense,
    </p>
    <p>
     and did all that could be humanely done to have the truth made known, to
    </p>
    <p>
     overset the mass of perjury and fraud enmeshing Gabriel, and to force
    </p>
    <p>
     his acquittal.
    </p>
    <p>
     As easily might she have bidden the sea rise from its bed and flood the
    </p>
    <p>
     dry and arid wastes of old Sahara. Her voice and that of the Socialists,
    </p>
    <p>
     their lawyers and their press, sounded in vain. A solid battery of
    </p>
    <p>
     capitalist papers, legal lights, private detectives and other
    </p>
    <p>
     means--particularly including the majority of the priests and
    </p>
    <p>
     clergy--swamped the man and damned him and doomed him from the first
    </p>
    <p>
     word of the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Money flowed in floods. Perjury overran the banks of the River of
    </p>
    <p>
     Corruption. Herzog branded the man a thief and fire-eater. Dope-fiends
    </p>
    <p>
     and harlots from the Red-Light district, "madames" and pimps and
    </p>
    <p>
     hangers-on, swore to the white-slave activities of this man, who never
    </p>
    <p>
     yet in all his four and twenty years had so much as entered a brothel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forged papers fixed past crimes and sentences on him. By innuendo and
    </p>
    <p>
     direct statement, dynamitings, arsons, violence and rioting in many
    </p>
    <p>
     strikes were laid at his door. His Socialist activities were dragged in
    </p>
    <p>
     the slime of every gutter; and his Party made to suffer for evil deeds
    </p>
    <p>
     existing only in the foul imagination of the prosecuting attorneys. The
    </p>
    <p>
     finest "kept" brains in the legal profession conducted the case from
    </p>
    <p>
     start to finish; and not a juryman was drawn on the panel who was not,
    </p>
    <p>
     from the first, sworn to convict, and bought and paid for in hard cash.
    </p>
    <p>
     After three days--days in which Gabriel plumbed the bitterest depths of
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell and drank full draughts of gall and wormwood--the verdict came.
    </p>
    <p>
     Came, and was flashed from sea to sea by an exulting press; and preached
    </p>
    <p>
     on, and editorialized on, and gloated over by Flint and Waldron and
    </p>
    <p>
     many, many others of that ilk--while Catherine wept tears that seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     drain her very heart of its last drops of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last she knew the meaning of the Class Struggle and her terrible
    </p>
    <p>
     father's part in it all. At last she understood what Gabriel had so long
    </p>
    <p>
     understood and now was paying for--the fact that Hell hath no fury like
    </p>
    <p>
     Capitalism when endangered or opposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Price! Gabriel now must pay it, to the full. For that foul verdict,
    </p>
    <p>
     bought with gold wrung from the very blood and marrow of countless
    </p>
    <p>
     toilers, opened the way to the sentence which Judge Harpies regretted
    </p>
    <p>
     only that he could not make more severe--the sentence which the
    </p>
    <p>
     detectives and the prison authorities, well "fixed," counted on making a
    </p>
    <p>
     death-sentence, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gabriel Armstrong, stand up!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He arose and faced the court. A deathlike stillness hushed the room,
    </p>
    <p>
     crowded with Socialists, reporters, emissaries of Flint, private
    </p>
    <p>
     detectives and hangers-on of the System. Heavily veiled, lest some of
    </p>
    <p>
     her father's people recognize her, Catherine herself sat in a back seat,
    </p>
    <p>
     very pale yet calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Prisoner at the bar, have you anything to say, why sentence should not
    </p>
    <p>
     be pronounced upon you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel, also a little pale, but with a steadfast and fearless gaze,
    </p>
    <p>
     looked at the legal prostitute upon the bench, and shook his head in
    </p>
    <p>
     negation. He deigned not, even, to answer this kept puppet of the ruling
    </p>
    <p>
     class.
    </p>
    <p>
     Judge Harpies frowned a trifle, cleared his throat, glanced about him
    </p>
    <p>
     with pompous dignity; and then, in a sonorous and impressive tone--his
    </p>
    <p>
     best asset on the bench, for legal knowledge and probity were not
    </p>
    <p>
     his--announced:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_It is the judgment of this court that you do stand committed to pay a
    </p>
    <p>
     fine of three thousand dollars into the treasury of the United States,
    </p>
    <p>
     and to serve five years at hard labor in the Federal Penitentiary at
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlanta!_"
    </p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter">
    <head>
     CHAPTER XXVII.
    </head>
    <p>
     BACK IN THE SUNLIGHT.
    </p>
    <p>
     Four years and two months from the day when this iniquitous verdict fell
    </p>
    <p>
     from the lips of the "bought and paid for" judge, a sturdily built and
    </p>
    <p>
     square jawed man stood on the steps of the Atlanta Penitentiary and, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the first time in all these weary months and years, faced the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pale with the prison-pallor that never fails to set its seal on the
    </p>
    <p>
     victims of a diseased society, which that society retaliates upon by
    </p>
    <p>
     shutting away from God's own light and air, this man stood there on the
    </p>
    <p>
     steps, a moment, then advanced to meet a woman who was coming toward him
    </p>
    <p>
     in the August glare. As he removed his cheap, convict-made cap, one saw
    </p>
    <p>
     his finely shaped head, close cropped with the infamous prison badge of
    </p>
    <p>
     servitude. Despite the shoddy miserable prison-suit that the prostituted
    </p>
    <p>
     government had given him--a suit that would have made Apollo grotesque
    </p>
    <p>
     and would have marked any man as an ex-convict, thus heavily
    </p>
    <p>
     handicapping him from the start--Gabriel Armstrong's poise and strength
    </p>
    <p>
     still made themselves manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the smile as they two, the woman and he, came together and their
    </p>
    <p>
     hands clasped, lighted his pale features with a ray brighter than that
    </p>
    <p>
     of the blistering Southern sunshine flooding down upon them both.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I knew you'd come, Catherine," said he, simply, his voice still the
    </p>
    <p>
     same deep, vibrant, earnest voice which, all that time ago, had thrilled
    </p>
    <p>
     and inspired her at the hour of her great conversion. Still were his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes clear, level and commanding; and through his splendid body, despite
    </p>
    <p>
     all his jailers had been able to do, coursed an abundant life and strong
    </p>
    <p>
     vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel had served his time with consummate skill, courage and
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence. Like all wise men, he had recognized _force majeure_, and
    </p>
    <p>
     had submitted. He had made practically no infractions of the prison
    </p>
    <p>
     rules, during his whole "bit." He had been quiet, obedient and
    </p>
    <p>
     industrious. His work, in the brush factory, had always been well done;
    </p>
    <p>
     and though he had consistently refused to bear tales, to spy, to inform
    </p>
    <p>
     or be a stool-pigeon--the quickest means of winning favor in any
    </p>
    <p>
     prison--yet he had given no opportunity for savagery and violence to be
    </p>
    <p>
     applied to him. Not even Flint's eager wish to have his jailers force
    </p>
    <p>
     him into rebellion had succeeded. Realizing to the full the sort of
    </p>
    <p>
     tactics that would be used to break, and if possible to kill him,
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel had met them all with calm self-reliance and with a generalship
    </p>
    <p>
     that showed his brain and nerves were still unshaken. On their own
    </p>
    <p>
     ground he had met these brutes, and he had beaten them at their own
    </p>
    <p>
     game.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their attempt to make a "dope" out of him had ignominiously failed. He
    </p>
    <p>
     had detected the morphine they had cleverly mixed with his water; and,
    </p>
    <p>
     after his drowsiness and weird dreams had convinced him of the plot, had
    </p>
    <p>
     turned the trick on it by secretly emptying this water out and by
    </p>
    <p>
     drinking only while in the shop, where he could draw water from the
    </p>
    <p>
     faucet. The cell guards' intelligence had been too limited to make them
    </p>
    <p>
     inquire of the brush shop guards about his habits. Also, Gabriel, had
    </p>
    <p>
     feigned stupefaction while in the cell. Thus he had simulated the
    </p>
    <p>
     effects of the drug, and had really thrown his tormentors off the track.
    </p>
    <p>
     For months and months they were convinced that they were weakening his
    </p>
    <p>
     will and destroying his mentality, while as a matter of fact his
    </p>
    <p>
     reasoning powers and determination never had been more keen.
    </p>
    <p>
     By bathing as often as possible, by taking regular and carefully planned
    </p>
    <p>
     calisthenics, by reading the best books in the prison library, by
    </p>
    <p>
     attention to every rule of health within his means, and by allowing
    </p>
    <p>
     himself no vices, not even his pipe, Gabriel now was emerging from the
    </p>
    <p>
     Bastile of Capitalism in a condition of mind and body so little impaired
    </p>
    <p>
     that he knew a few weeks would entirely restore him. The good conduct
    </p>
    <p>
     allowance, or "copper," which they had been forced to allow him for
    </p>
    <p>
     exemplary conduct, had cut ten months off his sentence. And now in
    </p>
    <p>
     mid-August of 1925, there he stood, a free man again, with purpose still
    </p>
    <p>
     unshaken and with a woman by his side who shared his high ambition and
    </p>
    <p>
     asked no better lot than to work with him toward the one great
    </p>
    <p>
     aim--Socialism!
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as these two walked side by side along the sunbaked street of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sweltering Southern town, Gabriel was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
     "So I haven't changed as much as you expected? I'm glad of that, Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only superficial changes, at most. Just give me a little time to pull
    </p>
    <p>
     together and get my legs under me again, and--forward march! Charge the
    </p>
    <p>
     forts! Eh, Catherine?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded, smiling. Smiles were rare with her, now. She had grown
    </p>
    <p>
     sober and serious, in these years of work and battle and stern endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Catherine Flint of the old times had vanished--the Catherine of
    </p>
    <p>
     country club days, and golf and tennis, and the opera--the Catherine of
    </p>
    <p>
     Newport, of the horse show, of Paris, of "society." In her place now
    </p>
    <p>
     lived another and a nobler woman, a woman known and loved the length and
    </p>
    <p>
     breadth of the land, a woman exalted and strengthened by new, high and
    </p>
    <p>
     splendid race-aspirations; by a vision of supernal beauty--the vision of
    </p>
    <p>
     the world for the workers, each for all and all for each!
    </p>
    <p>
     She had grown more mature and beautiful, with the passing years. No mark
    </p>
    <p>
     of time had yet laid its hand upon her face or figure. Young, still--she
    </p>
    <p>
     was now but five-and-twenty, and Gabriel only twenty-eight--she walked
    </p>
    <p>
     like a goddess, lithe, strong and filled with overflowing vigor. Her
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes glowed with noble enthusiasms; and every thought, every impulse and
    </p>
    <p>
     endeavor now was upward, onward, filled with stimulus and hope and
    </p>
    <p>
     courage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, a braver, broader and more splendid woman than Gabriel had known
    </p>
    <p>
     in the other days of his first love for her--the days when he had wished
    </p>
    <p>
     her penniless, the days when her prospective millions stood between
    </p>
    <p>
     them--she walked beside him now. And they two, comrades, understood each
    </p>
    <p>
     other; spoke the same language, shared the same aspirations, dreamed the
    </p>
    <p>
     same wondrous dreams. Their smile, as their eyes met, was in itself a
    </p>
    <p>
     benediction and a warm caress.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Charge the forts!" Gabriel repeated. "Yes, Kate, the battle still goes
    </p>
    <p>
     on, no matter what happens. Here and there, soldiers fall and die. Even
    </p>
    <p>
     battalions perish; but the war continues. When I think of all the
    </p>
    <p>
     fights you've been in, since I was put away, I'm unspeakably envious.
    </p>
    <p>
     You've been through the Tawana Valley strike, the big Consolidated
    </p>
    <p>
     Western lockout and the Imperial Mills massacre. You were a delegate to
    </p>
    <p>
     the 1923 Revolution Congress, in Berlin, and saw the slaughter in Unter
    </p>
    <p>
     den Linden--helped nurse the wounded comrades, inside the Treptow Park
    </p>
    <p>
     barricades. Then, out in California--"
    </p>
    <p>
     She checked him, with a hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please don't, Gabriel," she entreated. "What I have done has been so
    </p>
    <p>
     little, so terribly, pitiably little, compared to what _needs_ to be
    </p>
    <p>
     done! And then remember, too, that in and through all, this thought has
    </p>
    <p>
     run, like the red thread through every cable of the British navy--the
    </p>
    <p>
     thought that in my every activity, I am working against my own father,
    </p>
    <p>
     combatting him, being as it were a traitor and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Traitor?" exclaimed the man. "Never! The bond between you two is
    </p>
    <p>
     forever broken. You recognize in him, now, an enemy of all mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron is another. So is every one of the Air Trust group--that is to
    </p>
    <p>
     say, the small handful of men who today own the whole world and
    </p>
    <p>
     everything in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your father, as President of that world-corporation which potentially
    </p>
    <p>
     controls two thousand millions of human beings--and which will,
    </p>
    <p>
     tomorrow, absolutely control them, is no longer any father of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He is a world-emperor, and his few associates are princes of the royal
    </p>
    <p>
     house. Your life and thought have forever broken with him. No more can
    </p>
    <p>
     bonds and ties of blood hold you. Your larger duty calls to battle
    </p>
    <p>
     against this man. Treachery? A thousand times, no! Treason to tyrants
    </p>
    <p>
     is obedience to God! Or, if not God, then to mankind!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He paused and looked at her. They had now reached a little park, some
    </p>
    <p>
     half mile from the grim and dour old walls of the Federal Pen. Trees and
    </p>
    <p>
     grass and playing children seemed to invite them to stop and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though strong, moreover, Gabriel had for so long been unused to walking,
    </p>
    <p>
     that even this short distance had tired him a little. And the oppressive
    </p>
    <p>
     heat had them both by the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shall we sit down here and wait a little?" asked he. "Plan a little,
    </p>
    <p>
     see where we are and what's to be done next?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course," she said, "even if I could have got word in to you, I
    </p>
    <p>
     wouldn't have given you our real plans."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hardly!" he exclaimed. Then, coming to a fountain, they sat down on a
    </p>
    <p>
     bench close by. Nobody, they made sure, was within ear-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank God," he breathed, "that you, Kate, and only you, met me as I
    </p>
    <p>
     came out! It was a grand good idea, wasn't it, to keep my time of
    </p>
    <p>
     liberation a secret from the comrades? Otherwise there might have been a
    </p>
    <p>
     crowd on hand, and various kinds of foolishness; and time and energy
    </p>
    <p>
     would have been used that might have been better spent in working for
    </p>
    <p>
     the Revolution!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at him a trifle curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You forget," said she, "that all public meetings have been prohibited,
    </p>
    <p>
     ever since last April. Federal statute--the new Penfield Bill--'The
    </p>
    <p>
     Muzzler' as we call it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's so!" he murmured. "I forgot. Fact is, Kate, I _am_ out of touch
    </p>
    <p>
     with things. While you've been fighting, I've been buried alive. Now, I
    </p>
    <p>
     must learn much, before I can jump back into the war again. And above
    </p>
    <p>
     all, I must lose my identity. That's the first and most essential thing
    </p>
    <p>
     of all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course," she assented. "They--the Air Trust World-corporation--will
    </p>
    <p>
     trail you, everywhere you go. All this, as you know, has been provided
    </p>
    <p>
     for. You must vanish a while."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Indeed I must. If they 'jobbed' me like that, in 1921, what won't they
    </p>
    <p>
     do now in 1925?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "They won't ever get you, again, Gabriel," she answered, "if your wits
    </p>
    <p>
     and ours combined, can beat them. True, the Movement has been badly shot
    </p>
    <p>
     to pieces. That is, its visible organization has suffered, and it's
    </p>
    <p>
     outlawed. But under the surface, Gabriel, you haven't an idea of its
    </p>
    <p>
     spread and power. It's tremendous--it's a volcano waiting to burst! Let
    </p>
    <p>
     the moment come, the leader rise, the fire burst forth, and God knows
    </p>
    <p>
     what may not happen!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Splendid!" exclaimed Gabriel. "The battle calls me, like a
    </p>
    <p>
     clarion-call! But we must act with circumspection. The Plutes, powerful
    </p>
    <p>
     as they now are, won't need even the shadow of an excuse to plant me for
    </p>
    <p>
     life, or slug or shoot me. Things were rotten enough, then; but today
    </p>
    <p>
     they're worse. The hand of this Air Trust monopoly, grasping every line
    </p>
    <p>
     of work and product in the world, has got the lid nailed fast. We're all
    </p>
    <p>
     slaves, every man and woman of us. Even our Socialists in Congress can
    </p>
    <p>
     do nothing, with all these muzzling and sedition and treason bills, and
    </p>
    <p>
     with this conscription law just through. Now that the government--the
    </p>
    <p>
     Air Trust, that is to say--is running the railways and telegraphs and
    </p>
    <p>
     telephones, a strike is treason--and treason is death! Kate, this year
    </p>
    <p>
     of grace, 1925, is worse than ever I dreamed it would be. Oh, infinitely
    </p>
    <p>
     worse! No wonder our movement has been driven largely underground. No
    </p>
    <p>
     wonder that the war of mass and class is drawing near--the actual,
    </p>
    <p>
     physical war between the Air Trust few and the vast, toiling, suffering,
    </p>
    <p>
     stifling world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said she, "it's coming, and soon. Things are as you say, and even
    </p>
    <p>
     worse than you say, Gabriel. I know more of them, now, than you can
    </p>
    <p>
     know. Remember London's 'Iron Heel?' When I first read it I thought it
    </p>
    <p>
     fanciful and wild. God knows I was mistaken! London didn't put it half
    </p>
    <p>
     strongly enough. The beginning was made when the National Mounted Police
    </p>
    <p>
     came in. All the rest has swiftly followed. If you and I live five years
    </p>
    <p>
     longer, Gabriel, we'll see a harsher, sterner and more murderous
    </p>
    <p>
     trampling of that Heel than ever Comrade Jack imagined!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right!" said he. "And for that very reason, Kate, I've got to go into
    </p>
    <p>
     hiding till my beard and hair grow and I can reappear as a different
    </p>
    <p>
     man. Don't look, just now, but in a minute take a peek. Over on that
    </p>
    <p>
     third bench, on the other side of the park, see that man? Well, he's a
    </p>
    <p>
     'shadow.' There were three waiting for me, at the prison gates. You
    </p>
    <p>
     couldn't spot them, but I could. One was that Italian banana-seller that
    </p>
    <p>
     stood at the curb, on the first corner. Another was a taxi driver. And
    </p>
    <p>
     this one, over there, is the third. From now till they 'get' me again,
    </p>
    <p>
     they'll follow me like bloodhounds. I can't go free, to do my work and
    </p>
    <p>
     take part in the impending war, till I shake them. Look, now, do you
    </p>
    <p>
     see the one I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Cautiously the girl looked round, with casual glance as though to see a
    </p>
    <p>
     little boy playing by the fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," she murmured. "Who is he? Do you know his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," answered Gabriel. "His name, no. But I remember him, well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's the larger of the two detectives I knocked out, in that room in
    </p>
    <p>
     Rochester. Beside his pay, he's got a personal motive in landing me back
    </p>
    <p>
     in 'stir,' or sending me 'up the escape,' as prison slang names a
    </p>
    <p>
     penitentiary and a death. So then," he added, "what's the first thing?
    </p>
    <p>
     Where shall I go, and how, to hide and metamorphose? I'm in your hands,
    </p>
    <p>
     now, Kate. More than four years out of the world, remember, makes a
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow want a little lift when he comes back!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiled and nodded comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't explain, Gabriel," said she. "I understand. And I've got just the
    </p>
    <p>
     place in mind for you. Also, the way to get there. You see, comrade,
    </p>
    <p>
     we've been planning on this release. When can you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "When? Right now!" exclaimed Gabriel, standing up. "The quicker, the
    </p>
    <p>
     better. Every minute I lose in getting myself ready to jump back into
    </p>
    <p>
     the fight, is a precious treasure that can never be regained!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go, then," said she, with pride in her eyes. "I will wait here. Don't
    </p>
    <p>
     think of me; leave me here; I am self-reliant in every way. Go to the
    </p>
    <p>
     Cuthbert House, on Desplaines Street. Everything has been arranged for
    </p>
    <p>
     your escape. Every link in the chain is complete. Remember, we are
    </p>
    <p>
     working more underground, now, than when you were sentenced. And our
    </p>
    <p>
     machinery is almost perfect. Register at the hotel and take a room for a
    </p>
    <p>
     week. Then--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Register, under my own name?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Under your own name. Stay there two days. You won't be molested so
    </p>
    <p>
     soon, and things won't be ready for you till the third day. On that
    </p>
    <p>
     day--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "A message will come for you, that's all. Obey it. You have nothing more
    </p>
    <p>
     to do."
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I understand," said he. "But, Kate--who's paying for all this? Not
    </p>
    <p>
     _you_? I--I can't have _you_ paying, now that every dollar you have must
    </p>
    <p>
     be earned by your own labor!"
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiled a smile of wonderful beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Foolish, rebellious boy!" said she. "Have no fear! All expense will be
    </p>
    <p>
     borne by the Party, just as the Party paid your fine. It needs you and
    </p>
    <p>
     must have you; and were the cost ten times as great, would bear it to
    </p>
    <p>
     get you back! Remember, Gabriel, the Party is far larger than when you
    </p>
    <p>
     were buried alive in a cell. Even though in some ways outlawed and
    </p>
    <p>
     suppressed, its potential power is tremendous. All it needs is the
    </p>
    <p>
     electric spark to cause the world-shaking explosion. All that keeps us
    </p>
    <p>
     from power now is the Iron Heel--that, and the clutch of the Air Trust
    </p>
    <p>
     already crushing and mangling us!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go, now," she concluded. "Go, and rest a while, and wait. All shall be
    </p>
    <p>
     well. But first, you must get back your strength completely, and find
    </p>
    <p>
     yourself, and take your place again in the ranks of the great,
    </p>
    <p>
     subterranean army!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And shall I see you soon, again?" he asked, his voice trembling just a
    </p>
    <p>
     little as their hands clasped once more, and once more parted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You will see me soon," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "In a safe place, where we can plan, and work, and organize for the
    </p>
    <p>
     final blow! Now, you shall know no more. Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     One last look each gave the other. Their eyes met, more caressingly than
    </p>
    <p>
     many a kiss; and, turning, Gabriel took his way, alone, toward
    </p>
    <p>
     Desplaines Street.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the exit of the park, he looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
     There Catherine sat, on the bench. But, seemingly quite oblivious to
    </p>
    <p>
     everything, she was now reading a little book. Though he lingered a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment, hoping to get some signal from her, she never stirred or looked
    </p>
    <p>
     up from the page.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sighing, with a strange feeling of sudden loneliness and a vast, empty
    </p>
    <p>
     yearning in his heart, Gabriel continued on his way, toward what? He
    </p>
    <p>
     knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
     The detective on the other side of the park, no longer sat there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, somewhere, he had disappeared.

     CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </head>
    <p>
     IN THE REFUGE.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far on the western slopes of Clingman Dome in the great Smoky Mountains
    </p>
    <p>
     of North Carolina, a broad, low-built bungalow stood facing the setting
    </p>
    <p>
     sun. Vast stretches of pine forest shut it off from civilization and the
    </p>
    <p>
     prying activities of Plutocracy. The nearest settlement was Ravens,
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty miles away to eastward, across inaccessible ridges and ravines.
    </p>
    <p>
     Running far to southward, the railway left this wilderness untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
     High overhead, an eagle soared among the "thunder-heads" that presaged a
    </p>
    <p>
     storm up Sevier Pass. And, red through the haze to westward, the great
    </p>
    <p>
     huge sunball slid down the heavens toward the tumbled, jagged mass of
    </p>
    <p>
     peaks that rimmed the far horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Within the bungalow, a murmur of voices sounded; and from the huge stone
    </p>
    <p>
     chimney a curl of smoke, arising, told of the evening meal, within, now
    </p>
    <p>
     being made ready. On the wide piazza sat a man, writing at a table of
    </p>
    <p>
     plain boards roughly pegged together. Still a trifle pale, yet with a
    </p>
    <p>
     look of health and vigor, he sat there hard at work, writing as fast as
    </p>
    <p>
     pen could travel. Hardly a word he changed. Sheet by sheet he wrote, and
    </p>
    <p>
     pushed them aside and still worked on. Some of the pages slid to the
    </p>
    <p>
     porch-floor, but he gave no heed. His brow was wrinkled with the
    </p>
    <p>
     intensity of his thought; and over his face, where now a disguising
    </p>
    <p>
     beard was beginning to be visible, the light of the sinking sun cast as
    </p>
    <p>
     it were a kind of glowing radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last the man looked up, and smiled, and eyed the golden mountain-tops
    </p>
    <p>
     far off across the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wonderful aerie in the hills!" he murmured. "Wonderful retreat and
    </p>
    <p>
     hiding-place--wonderful care and forethought to have made this possible
    </p>
    <p>
     for me! How shall I ever repay all this? How, save by giving my last
    </p>
    <p>
     drop of blood, if need be, for the final victory?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He pondered a moment, still half-thinking of the poem he had just
    </p>
    <p>
     finished, half-reflecting on the strange events of the past week--the
    </p>
    <p>
     secret ways, by swift auto, by boat, by monoplane which had brought him
    </p>
    <p>
     hither to this still undiscovered refuge. How had it all been arranged,
    </p>
    <p>
     he wondered; and who had made it possible? He could not tell, as yet. No
    </p>
    <p>
     information was forthcoming. But in his heart he understood, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     lips, murmuring the name of Catherine, blessed that name and tenderly
    </p>
    <p>
     revered it.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last Gabriel bent, picked up the pages that had fallen, and arranged
    </p>
    <p>
     them all in order.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tomorrow this shall go out to the world," said he, "and to our
    </p>
    <p>
     press--such of it as still remains. It may inspire some fainting heart
    </p>
    <p>
     and thrill some lagging mind. Now, that the final struggle is at hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     more than guns we need inspiration. More than force, to meet the force
    </p>
    <p>
     that has ravished our every right and crushed Constitution and Law,
    </p>
    <p>
     alike, we need spiritual insight and integrity. Only through these, and
    </p>
    <p>
     by these, come what may, can a true, lasting victory be attained!"
    </p>
    <p>
     In the doorway of the bungalow a woman appeared, her smile illumined by
    </p>
    <p>
     the sunset warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come, Gabriel," said she. "We're waiting--the Granthams, Craig, and
    </p>
    <p>
     Brevard. Supper's ready. Not one of them will sit down, till you come."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have I been delaying you?" asked Gabriel, turning toward the woman,
    </p>
    <p>
     with a smile that matched her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm afraid so, just a little," she answered. "But no matter; I'm glad.
    </p>
    <p>
     When you get to writing, you know, nothing else matters. One line of
    </p>
    <p>
     your verse is worth all the suppers in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nonsense!" he retorted. "I'm a mere scribbler!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "We won't argue that point," she answered. "But at any rate, you're
    </p>
    <p>
     done, now. So come along, boy--or the comrades will begin 'dividing up'
    </p>
    <p>
     without us; for this mountain air won't brook delay."
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel took a long breath, stretched his powerful arms out toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains, and raised his face to the last light of day.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nature!" he whispered. "Ever beautiful and ever young! Ah, could man
    </p>
    <p>
     but learn thy lessons and live close to thy great heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, turning, he followed Catherine into the bungalow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beautiful and restful though the outside was, the interior was more
    </p>
    <p>
     restful and more charming still.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the vast fireplace, to left, a fire of pine roots was crackling. The
    </p>
    <p>
     room was filled with their pitchy, wholesome perfume, with the dancing
    </p>
    <p>
     light of their blaze and with the warmth made grateful by that mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     height.
    </p>
    <p>
     Simple and comfortable all the furnishings were, hand-wrought for use
    </p>
    <p>
     and pleasure. Big chairs invited. Broad couches offered rest. No
    </p>
    <p>
     hunting-trophies, no heads of slaughtered wild things disfigured the
    </p>
    <p>
     walls, as in most bungalows; but the flickering firelight showed
    </p>
    <p>
     pictures that inspired thought and carried lessons home--pictures of
    </p>
    <p>
     toil and of repose, pictures of life, and love, and simple joy--pictures
    </p>
    <p>
     of tragedy, of reality and deep significance. Here one saw Millet's
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sower," and "Gleaners" and "The Man with the Hoe." There, Fritel's "The
    </p>
    <p>
     Conquerors," and Stuck's "War." A large copy of Bernard's "Labor,"--the
    </p>
    <p>
     sensation of the 1922 Paris Salon--hung above the mantelpiece, on which
    </p>
    <p>
     stood Rodin's "Miner" in bronze. Portraits of Marx, Engels, LaSalle and
    </p>
    <p>
     Debs, with others loved and honored in the Movement, showed between
    </p>
    <p>
     original sketches by Walter Crane, Balfour Kerr, Art Young and Ryan
    </p>
    <p>
     Walker. And in the well-filled bookshelves at the right, Socialist books
    </p>
    <p>
     in abundance all told the same tale to the observer--that this was a
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialist nest high up there among the mountains, and that every thought
    </p>
    <p>
     and word and deed was inspired by one great ideal and one alone--the
    </p>
    <p>
     Revolution!
    </p>
    <p>
     At a plain but well-covered table near the western windows, where fading
    </p>
    <p>
     sunlight helped firelight to illumine the little company, sat three
    </p>
    <p>
     men--two of them armed with heavy automatics--and a woman. Another
    </p>
    <p>
     woman, Catherine, was standing by her chair and beckoning Gabriel to
    </p>
    <p>
     his.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come, Comrade!" she exclaimed. "If you delay much longer, everything
    </p>
    <p>
     will be stone cold, and _then_ beg forgiveness if you dare!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your own fault, if you wait for me," he answered, seating himself. "You
    </p>
    <p>
     know how it is when you get to scribbling--you never know when to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the scenery, up here, won't let you go. Positively fascinating,
    </p>
    <p>
     that view is! If the Plutes knew of it, they'd put a summer resort
    </p>
    <p>
     here, and coin millions!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," answered Craig, once Congressman Craig, but now hiding from the
    </p>
    <p>
     Air Trust spies. "And what's more, they'd mighty soon confiscate this
    </p>
    <p>
     resting-up place of the Comrades, and have us back behind bars, or
    </p>
    <p>
     worse. But they _don't_ know about it, and aren't likely to. Thank
    </p>
    <p>
     Heaven for at least one place the Party can maintain as an asylum for
    </p>
    <p>
     our people when too hard-pressed! Not a road within ten miles of here.
    </p>
    <p>
     No way to reach this place, masked here in the cliffs and mountains,
    </p>
    <p>
     except by aeroplane. Not one chance in a thousand, fellows, that they'll
    </p>
    <p>
     ever find it. Confusion take them all!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The meal progressed, with plenty of serious and earnest discussion of
    </p>
    <p>
     the pressing problems now close at hand. Brevard, a short, spare man,
    </p>
    <p>
     editor of the recently-suppressed "San Francisco Revolutionist" and now
    </p>
    <p>
     in hiding, made a few trenchant remarks, from time to time. Grantham and
    </p>
    <p>
     his wife, both active speakers on the "Underground Circuit" and both
    </p>
    <p>
     under sentence of long imprisonment, said little. Most of the
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation was between Catherine, Craig and Gabriel. Long before the
    </p>
    <p>
     supper was done, lamps had to be brought and curtains lowered. At last
    </p>
    <p>
     the meal was over.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dessert, now, Gabriel!" exclaimed Grantham. "Your turn!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eh? What?" asked Armstrong. "My turn for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your turn to do your part! Don't think that you're going to write a
    </p>
    <p>
     poem and then put it in your pocket, that way. Come, out with it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel's protests availed nothing. The others overbore him. And at
    </p>
    <p>
     last, unwillingly, he drew out the manuscript and spread it open on his
    </p>
    <p>
     knee.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You really want to hear this?" he demanded. "If you can possibly spare
    </p>
    <p>
     me, I wish you would!"
    </p>
    <p>
     For all answer, Craig pushed a lamp over toward him. The warm light on
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel's face, now slightly bearded, and on his strong, corded throat,
    </p>
    <p>
     made a striking picture as he cast his eyes on the manuscript and in
    </p>
    <p>
     vibrant and harmonious voice, read:
    </p>
    <p>
     _I SAW THE SOCIALIST_
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw the Socialist sitting at a great Banquet of Men,
    </p>
    <p>
     Sitting with honored leaders of the blind, unwitting Multitude;
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw him there with the writers, editors, painters, men of letters,
    </p>
    <p>
     Legislators and judges, the Leaders of the People,
    </p>
    <p>
     Leaders flushed with the wines of price, eating costly and rare
    </p>
    <p>
     foods,
    </p>
    <p>
     Making loud talk, and boastful, of that marvel, American Liberty!
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking were they no thought of hunger and pinching cold;
    </p>
    <p>
     Of the blue-lipped, skinny children, the thin-chested, coughing men,
    </p>
    <p>
     The dry-breasted mothers, the dirt, disease and ignorance,
    </p>
    <p>
     The mangled workmen, the tramps, drunkards, pickpockets,
    </p>
    <p>
     prostitutes, thieves,
    </p>
    <p>
     The mad-houses, jails, asylums and hospitals, the sores, the blood
    </p>
    <p>
     of war,
    </p>
    <p>
     And all the other wondrous blessings that attend our civilization--
    </p>
    <p>
     That civilization through which the wines and foods were given them.
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw the Socialist there, calm, unmoved, unsmiling, thoughtful,
    </p>
    <p>
     Sober, serious, full of dispassionate and prophetic vision,
    </p>
    <p>
     Not like the other men, the all-wise Leaders of the People.
    </p>
    <p>
     The political economists, the professors, the militarists, heroes
    </p>
    <p>
     and statisticians;
    </p>
    <p>
     Not like the kings and presidents and emperors, the nobles and
    </p>
    <p>
     gold-crammed bankers,
    </p>
    <p>
     But mindful, more than they, of the cellars under the House of Life
    </p>
    <p>
     Where blind things crawl in the dark, things men and yet not human,
    </p>
    <p>
     Things whose toil makes possible the Banquets of the Leaders of Men,
    </p>
    <p>
     Things that live and yet are not alive; things that never taste of
    </p>
    <p>
     Life;
    </p>
    <p>
     Things that make the rich foods, themselves snatching filthy crumbs;
    </p>
    <p>
     Things that produce the wines of price, and must be content with
    </p>
    <p>
     lees;
    </p>
    <p>
     Things that shiver and cringe and whine, that snarl sometimes,
    </p>
    <p>
     That are men and women and children, and yet that know not Life!
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw the Socialist there; I sat at the banquet; beside him,
    </p>
    <p>
     Listened to the surging music, saw all the lights and flowers,
    </p>
    <p>
     Flowers and lights and crystal cups, whereof the price for each
    </p>
    <p>
     Might have brought back from Potter's Field some bloodless,
    </p>
    <p>
     starving baby.
    </p>
    <p>
     I heard the Leaders' speeches, the turgid oratory,
    </p>
    <p>
     The well-turned phrases of the Captains, the rotund babble of
    </p>
    <p>
     prosperity,
    </p>
    <p>
     (Prosperity for whom? Nay, ask not troublesome questions!)
    </p>
    <p>
     The Captains' vaunting I heard, their boasts of glory and victory,
    </p>
    <p>
     While red, red, red their hands dripped red with the blood of the
    </p>
    <p>
     butchered workers.
    </p>
    <p>
     I heard the Judges' self-glorification, Quixotic fighting of
    </p>
    <p>
     windmills,
    </p>
    <p>
     Heard also the unclean jests that those respected Leaders told.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as I looked and listened, I still observed the Socialist,
    </p>
    <p>
     Unmoved and patient and serious, calm, full of sober reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then there spake (among many others) an honored and full-paunched
    </p>
    <p>
     Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rubicund he was, and of portly habit of body,
    </p>
    <p>
     Shepherd of a well-pastured flock, mightily content with God,
    </p>
    <p>
     Out of whose omnipotent Hand (no doubt) the blessings of his life
    </p>
    <p>
     descended.
    </p>
    <p>
     I heard this exponent of Christ the Crucified, Christ the Carpenter,
    </p>
    <p>
     Christ the Leader of Workingmen, the Agitator, the Disturber,
    </p>
    <p>
     Christ the Labor-organizer, Christ the Archetypal Socialist,
    </p>
    <p>
     Friend of the dwellers in the pits of Life, Consoler of earth's
    </p>
    <p>
     exploited,
    </p>
    <p>
     Who once with the lash scourged from the Temple the unclean
    </p>
    <p>
     graft-brood of usurers.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the rotund Bishop's words were as the crackling of dry thorns
    </p>
    <p>
     Under a pot, bubbling without use in the desert of dreary
    </p>
    <p>
     platitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The story he told was spiced and garnished with profane words,
    </p>
    <p>
     Whereat the Leaders laughed in their cups, making great show of
    </p>
    <p>
     merriment,
    </p>
    <p>
     So that the banquet-hall rang, and wine was spilt on the linen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wine as red as blood--the blood of the shattered miner,
    </p>
    <p>
     Blood of the boy in the rifle-pits, blood of the coughing
    </p>
    <p>
     child-slave,
    </p>
    <p>
     Blood of the mangled trainman, blood that the Carpenter shed.
    </p>
    <p>
     And still I watched the Socialist. Sober, judicial, observant
    </p>
    <p>
     And full of greater wisdom he was than to laugh with the tipsy
    </p>
    <p>
     Leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
     His eyes were fixed on the Bishop, vice-regent of God upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as I watched the Socialist, the unmoved, the contemplative one,
    </p>
    <p>
     He thoughtfully took his pencil, he took the fine and large card
    </p>
    <p>
     Whereon the names of the rich foods and all the costly wines were
    </p>
    <p>
     printed,
    </p>
    <p>
     And made a few notes of the feast, notes of the Bishop's speech,
    </p>
    <p>
     Notes to remind him to search the slums for the great, God-given
    </p>
    <p>
     prosperity,
    </p>
    <p>
     Which all the Judges, Lawmakers, Captains and Leaders knew to be
    </p>
    <p>
     "our" portion;
    </p>
    <p>
     Notes of the flowers, the wine, the lights, the music, the splendor,
    </p>
    <p>
     Notes of the Leaders' oratory, notes of the Bishop's deep-voiced
    </p>
    <p>
     unctiousness,
    </p>
    <p>
     Notes he made; and as I looked at the notes he was carefully
    </p>
    <p>
     writing,
    </p>
    <p>
     The words ran red like wine and blood, they blazed like the blazing
    </p>
    <p>
     lights!
    </p>
    <p>
     Words they were of blood and fire, that spread, that filled the
    </p>
    <p>
     banquet-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Words of old, I read them--"MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSHIN!--
    </p>
    <p>
     Weighed in the Balance you are, ye Leaders respected of men,
    </p>
    <p>
     You Statesmen, Lawmakers, Judges, Captains, Bishops, vice-regents of
    </p>
    <p>
     God!
    </p>
    <p>
     Weighed and tried and found wanting. Give way, now, to what shall
    </p>
    <p>
     come after!
    </p>
    <p>
     Make ye way for the Men who shall do what ye have but neglected and
    </p>
    <p>
     shirked!
    </p>
    <p>
     Make ye way for a Time which hath more than Power and Greed for its
    </p>
    <p>
     watchwords!
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon your day shall decline forever, your sun shall sink and shall
    </p>
    <p>
     vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then from the Cellars of Life the darkness-dwellers shall issue,
    </p>
    <p>
     Greeting another daunt which shall have more than pain for its
    </p>
    <p>
     portion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then no more shall the humble, the lowly, the friends of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Nazarene Carpenter
    </p>
    <p>
     Be starved, be mangled for gold, be crucified, slaughtered, bled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Make ye way!...Make ye way!..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Such was the message I read, the words of that fire-writ warning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then peace came back to my spirit, calm peace, and hope and
    </p>
    <p>
     patience:
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, through my anger and heat, I thought of the Retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even more clearly I saw the New Birth of this weary world,
    </p>
    <p>
     This world now groaning in chains, with the bloody sweat of
    </p>
    <p>
     oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
     These things and many more, such as were hard to write of,
    </p>
    <p>
     I read in the words of the Socialist, patient, peaceful and sober,
    </p>
    <p>
     Full of prophetic vision, above all things hopeful and patient,
    </p>
    <p>
     Written in living flame at the Feast of the Leaders of Men....

     CHAPTER XXIX.
    </head>
    <p>
     "APRÃS NOUS LE DÃLUGE!"
    </p>
    <p>
     As Gabriel's voice fell to silence, after the last words, a stillness
    </p>
    <p>
     came upon the lamp-lit room, a hush broken only by the snapping of the
    </p>
    <p>
     pine-root fire on the hearth and by the busy ticking of the clock upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the chimneypiece. Then, after a minute's pause, Craig reached over and
    </p>
    <p>
     took Gabriel by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I salute you, O poet of the Revolution now impending!" he cried, while
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine's eyes gleamed bright with tears. "Would God that _I_ could
    </p>
    <p>
     write like that, old man!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And would God that my paper was still being issued!" Brevard added,
    </p>
    <p>
     making a gesture with the pipe that, in his eagerness to hear, he had
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed to die. "If it were I'd give that poem my front page, and fling
    </p>
    <p>
     its message full in the faces of Plutocracy!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel smiled a bit nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't, please don't," he begged. "If you really do like it help me
    </p>
    <p>
     spread it. Don't waste words on praise, but plan with me, tonight, how
    </p>
    <p>
     we can get this to the people--how we can perfect our final
    </p>
    <p>
     arrangements--what we must do, now, at once, to meet the Air Trust and
    </p>
    <p>
     defeat it before its terrible and unrelenting grip closes on the throat
    </p>
    <p>
     of the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right!" said Craig. "We must act at once, while there's yet time.
    </p>
    <p>
     today, all seems safe. The Air Trust spies haven't ferreted this place
    </p>
    <p>
     out. A week from now, they may have, and one of the most secure and
    </p>
    <p>
     useful Socialist refuges in the country may be only a heap of
    </p>
    <p>
     ashes--like the ones at Kenwyck, Hampden, Mount Desert and Loftiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every day is precious. Every one helps to perfect Gabriel's disguise and
    </p>
    <p>
     adds materially to his strength."
    </p>
    <p>
     "True," assented Gabriel. "We mustn't wait too long, now. That last
    </p>
    <p>
     report we got yesterday, by our wireless, ought to stimulate us.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brainard says, in it, that the Air Trust people are now putting the
    </p>
    <p>
     finishing touches on the Niagara plant. That will give them condensing
    </p>
    <p>
     machinery for over 90,000,000 horsepower, all told. As I see the thing,
    </p>
    <p>
     it looks absolutely as though, when _that_ is done, the whole Capitalist
    </p>
    <p>
     system of the world will center right there--focus there, as at a point.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let kings and emperors continue to strut and mouth vain phrases; let our
    </p>
    <p>
     own President and Congress make the motions of governing; even let Wall
    </p>
    <p>
     Street play at finance and power. All, all are empty and meaningless!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Power has been sucked dry, out of them all, comrades. You know as well
    </p>
    <p>
     as I know--better, perhaps--that all real power in the world, today,
    </p>
    <p>
     whether economic or political--nay, even the power of life and death,
    </p>
    <p>
     the power of breath or strangulation, has clotted at Niagara, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     central offices of the Air Trust; nay, right in Flint and Waldron's own
    </p>
    <p>
     inner office!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel had stood up, while speaking; and now, pacing the floor of the
    </p>
    <p>
     big living-room, glanced first at one eager and familiar face, then at
    </p>
    <p>
     another.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Comrades," said he, "we should not sleep, tonight. We should get out
    </p>
    <p>
     all our plans and data, all the dispatches that have come to us here,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the information at hand about our organization, whether open or
    </p>
    <p>
     subterranean. We should make this room and this time, in fact, the place
    </p>
    <p>
     and the hour for the planning of the last great blow on which hangs the
    </p>
    <p>
     fate of the world. If it succeed, the human race goes free again. If it
    </p>
    <p>
     fail--and God forbid!--then the whole world will lie in the grip of
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint and Waldron! With our other centers broken up and under espionage,
    </p>
    <p>
     our press forced into impotence--save our underground press--and
    </p>
    <p>
     political action now rendered farcical as ever it was in Mexico, when
    </p>
    <p>
     Diaz ruled, we have but one recourse!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And that is?" asked Catherine. "The general strike?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "A final, general, paralyzing strike; and with it, the actual, physical
    </p>
    <p>
     destruction of the colossal crime of crimes, the Air Trust works at
    </p>
    <p>
     Niagara!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A little silence followed. They all drew round the reading-table, now,
    </p>
    <p>
     near the fireplace. Mrs. Grantham brought a lamp; and Brevard, opening a
    </p>
    <p>
     chest near the book-case, fetched a portfolio of papers, dispatches,
    </p>
    <p>
     plans, reports and data of all kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gabriel's right," said he. "The time is ripe, now, or will be in a week
    </p>
    <p>
     or so. Nothing can be gained by delaying any longer. Every day adds to
    </p>
    <p>
     their power and may weaken ours. Our organization, for the strike and
    </p>
    <p>
     the attack on the works, is as complete as we can make it. We must come
    </p>
    <p>
     to extreme measures, at once, or world-strangulation will set in, and we
    </p>
    <p>
     shall be eternally too late!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Extreme measures, yes," said Gabriel, while Brevard spread the papers
    </p>
    <p>
     out and sorted them, and Craig drew contemplatively at his pipe. "The
    </p>
    <p>
     masters would have it so. Our one-time academic discussion about ways
    </p>
    <p>
     and means has become absurd, in the face of plutocratic savagery. We're
    </p>
    <p>
     up against facts, now, not theories. God knows it's against the dictates
    </p>
    <p>
     of my heart to do what must be done; but it's that or stand back and see
    </p>
    <p>
     the world be murdered, together with our own selves! And in a case of
    </p>
    <p>
     self-defense, no measures are unjustifiable.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Whatever happens our hands are clean. The plutocrats are the attacking
    </p>
    <p>
     force. They have chosen, and must take the consequences; they have sown,
    </p>
    <p>
     and must reap. One by one, they have limited and withdrawn every
    </p>
    <p>
     political right. They have taken away free speech and free assemblage,
    </p>
    <p>
     free press and universal suffrage. They have limited the right to vote,
    </p>
    <p>
     by property qualifications that have deprived the proletariat of every
    </p>
    <p>
     chance to make their will felt. They have put through this National
    </p>
    <p>
     Censorship outrage and--still worse--the National Mounted Police Bill,
    </p>
    <p>
     making Cossack rule supreme in the United States of America, as they
    </p>
    <p>
     have made it in the United States of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Before they elected that tool of tools, President Supple, in 1920, on
    </p>
    <p>
     the Anti-Socialist ticket, we still had some constitutional rights
    </p>
    <p>
     left--a few. But now, all are gone. With the absorption and annexation
    </p>
    <p>
     of Canada, Mexico and Central America, slavery full and absolute settled
    </p>
    <p>
     down upon us. The unions simply crumbled to dust as you know, in face of
    </p>
    <p>
     all those millions of Mexican peons swamping the labor-market with
    </p>
    <p>
     starvation-wage labor. Then, as we all remember, came the terrible
    </p>
    <p>
     series of strikes in 1921 and 1922, and the massacres at Hopedale and
    </p>
    <p>
     Boulder, at Los Angeles and Pittsburg, and, worst of all, Gary. That
    </p>
    <p>
     finished what few rights were left, that killing did. And then came the
    </p>
    <p>
     army of spies, and the proscriptions, and the electrocution of those
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred and eleven editors, speakers and organizers--why bring up all
    </p>
    <p>
     these things that we all know so well? _We_ were willing to play the
    </p>
    <p>
     game fair and square, and _they_ refused. Say that, and you say all.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No need to dwell on details, comrades. The Air Trust has had its will
    </p>
    <p>
     with the world, so far. It has crushed all opposition as relentlessly as
    </p>
    <p>
     the car of Juggernaut used to crush its blind, fanatical devotees. True,
    </p>
    <p>
     our Party still exists and has some standing and some representatives;
    </p>
    <p>
     but we all know what _power_ it has--in the open! Not _that_ much!" And
    </p>
    <p>
     he snapped his fingers in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In the open, none!" said Craig, blowing a cloud of smoke. "I admit
    </p>
    <p>
     that, Gabriel. But, underground--ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Underground," Gabriel took up the word, "forces are now at work that
    </p>
    <p>
     can shatter the whole infernal slavery to dust! This way of working is
    </p>
    <p>
     not our choice; it is theirs. They would have it so--now let them take
    </p>
    <p>
     their medicine!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, yes," eagerly exclaimed Catherine, her face flushed and intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm with you, Gabriel. To work!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "To work, yes," put in Craig, "but with system, order and method. My
    </p>
    <p>
     experience in Congress has taught me some valuable lessons. The
    </p>
    <p>
     universal, all-embracing Trust made marionettes of us, every one. Our
    </p>
    <p>
     strength was, to them, no more than that of a mouse to a lion. Their
    </p>
    <p>
     system is perfect, their lines of supply and communication are without a
    </p>
    <p>
     flaw. The Prussian army machine of other days was but a bungling
    </p>
    <p>
     experiment by comparison with the efficiency of this new mechanism. I
    </p>
    <p>
     tell you, Gabriel, we've got to give these tyrants credit for being
    </p>
    <p>
     infernally efficient tyrants! All that science has been able to devise,
    </p>
    <p>
     or press and church and university teach, or political subservience make
    </p>
    <p>
     possible, is theirs. And back of that, military power, and the courts
    </p>
    <p>
     and the prisons and the electric chair! And back of all _those_, the
    </p>
    <p>
     power to choke the whole world to submission, in a week!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel thought, a moment, before replying. Then said he:
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know it, Craig. All the more reason why we must hit them at once, and
    </p>
    <p>
     hit hard! These reports here," and he gestured at the papers that
    </p>
    <p>
     Brevard had spread out under the lamp-light, "prove that, at the proper
    </p>
    <p>
     signal, every chance indicates that we can paralyze transportation--the
    </p>
    <p>
     keynote of the whole situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "True, the government--that is to say, the Air Trust, and _that_ is to
    </p>
    <p>
     say, Flint and Waldron--can keep men in every engine-cab in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
     They can keep them at every switch and junction. But this isn't France,
    </p>
    <p>
     remember, nor is it any small, compact European country. Conditions are
    </p>
    <p>
     wholly different here. Everywhere, vast stretches of track exist. No
    </p>
    <p>
     power on earth--not even Flint and Waldron's--can guard all those
    </p>
    <p>
     hundreds of thousands of miles. And so I tell you, taking our data
    </p>
    <p>
     simply from these reports and not counting on any more organized
    </p>
    <p>
     strength than they show, we have today got the means of cutting and
    </p>
    <p>
     crippling, for a week at least, the movements of troops to Niagara. And
    </p>
    <p>
     that, just that, is all we need!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A little silence. Then said Catherine:
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean, Gabriel, that if we can keep the troops back for a little
    </p>
    <p>
     while, and annihilate the Air Trust plant itself, the great revolution
    </p>
    <p>
     will follow?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded, with a smouldering fire in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," said he. "If we can loosen the grip of this monster for only
    </p>
    <p>
     forty-eight hours, and flash the news to this bleeding, sweating,
    </p>
    <p>
     choking land that the grip _is_ loosened--after that we need do no more.
    </p>
    <p>
     _AprÃ¨s nous, le dÃ©luge_; only not now in the sense of wreck and ruin,
    </p>
    <p>
     but meaning that this deluge shall forever wash away the tyranny and
    </p>
    <p>
     crime of Capitalism! Forever and a day, to leave us free once more, free
    </p>
    <p>
     men and women, standing erect and facing God's own sunlight, our
    </p>
    <p>
     heritage and birthplace in this world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine made no answer, but her hand clasped his. The light on her
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificent masses of copper-golden hair, braided about her head,
    </p>
    <p>
     enhanced her beauty. And so for a moment, the little group sat there
    </p>
    <p>
     about the table--the group on which now so infinitely much depended; and
    </p>
    <p>
     the lamp-glow shone upon their precious plans, reports and diagrams.
    </p>
    <p>
     Into each others' eyes they looked, and knew the moment of final
    </p>
    <p>
     conflict was drawn very near, at last. The moment which, in failure or
    </p>
    <p>
     success, should for long years, for decades, for centuries perhaps,
    </p>
    <p>
     determine whether the world and all its teeming millions were to be
    </p>
    <p>
     slave or free.
    </p>
    <p>
     They spoke no word and took no oath of life-and-death fidelity, those
    </p>
    <p>
     men and women who now had been entrusted with the fate of the world. But
    </p>
    <p>
     in their eyes one read unshakable devotion to the Cause of Man,
    </p>
    <p>
     unswerving loyalty to the Great Ideal, and a calm, holy faith that would
    </p>
    <p>
     make light of death itself, could death but pave the way to victory!

    <p>
     TRAPPED!
    </p>
    <p>
     Brevard was the first to speak. "Gabriel," said he, "we have agreed that
    </p>
    <p>
     you must be the leader in this whole affair. The actual, personal
    </p>
    <p>
     leader. To begin with, you're younger and physically stronger than any
    </p>
    <p>
     of us men. Your executive ability is, without any question whatever, far
    </p>
    <p>
     and away ahead of ours--for we are more in the analytical, compiling,
    </p>
    <p>
     organizing, preparing line. To cap all, your personality carries more,
    </p>
    <p>
     far more, with the mass of the comrades than any of ours. Your career,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the past, your conflict with Flint and Waldron, and your long
    </p>
    <p>
     imprisonment, have given you the necessary following. You, and you
    </p>
    <p>
     alone, must issue the final call, lead the last, supreme attack, and
    </p>
    <p>
     carry the old flag, the Crimson Banner of Brotherhood, to the topmost
    </p>
    <p>
     battlement of an annihilated Capitalism!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel demurred, but they overruled him. So, presently, he consented;
    </p>
    <p>
     and pledged his life to it; and thrilled with pride and joy at thought
    </p>
    <p>
     of what now lay written in the Book of Fate, for him to read.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine's eyes shone with a strange light, as she looked upon him
    </p>
    <p>
     there, so modest yet so strong. And he, smiling a little as his gaze met
    </p>
    <p>
     hers, foresaw other things than war, and was glad. His heart sang within
    </p>
    <p>
     him, that memorable and wondrous night, up there in the hiding-place
    </p>
    <p>
     among the Great Smokies--there with Catherine and the other
    </p>
    <p>
     comrades--there planning the last great blow to strike away forever the
    </p>
    <p>
     shackles from the bleeding limbs of all the human race!
    </p>
    <p>
     But serious and urgent things were to be thought of, and at once, for on
    </p>
    <p>
     the morrow Brevard was going down, disguised, to Louisville, in one of
    </p>
    <p>
     the two monoplanes, to attend a final secret meeting of the North-middle
    </p>
    <p>
     Section Committee. From this he would proceed to the refuge near Port
    </p>
    <p>
     Colborne, Ontario.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let us make that our meeting-place, one week from tonight," said
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel, "in case anything happens. Should we be detected, or should any
    </p>
    <p>
     accident befall, we must have some time and place to rally by. Is my
    </p>
    <p>
     suggestion taken?"
    </p>
    <p>
     They all agreed, after some discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But," added Mrs. Grantham, "let's hope we're still secure here, for a
    </p>
    <p>
     while. It doesn't seem possible they could find us _here_, in this broad
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain wilderness!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Brevard, meanwhile, was spreading out diagrams and plans.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The plant at Niagara," said he. "Gabriel, study this, now, as you never
    </p>
    <p>
     yet have studied anything! For on your intimate knowledge of these
    </p>
    <p>
     plans--which, by the way, have been obtained only at the cost of eight
    </p>
    <p>
     lives of our comrades, and through adventures which alone would make a
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderful book--depends everything. With all communications cut, and
    </p>
    <p>
     troops kept away, and our own people storming the works, you will yet
    </p>
    <p>
     fail, Gabriel, unless you know every building, every courtyard, wall and
    </p>
    <p>
     passage, every door and window, almost, I might say. For the place is
    </p>
    <p>
     more than a manufacturing plant. It's a fortress, a city in itself, a
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderful, gigantic center to the whole web of world-domination!
    </p>
    <p>
     "So now, to the plans!"
    </p>
    <p>
     For hours, while Gabriel took notes and listened keenly, asked questions
    </p>
    <p>
     and made minute memoranda, Brevard explained the situation at the great
    </p>
    <p>
     Air Trust works. The others looked on, listened, and from time to time
    </p>
    <p>
     made suggestions; but for the most part they kept silent, unwilling to
    </p>
    <p>
     disturb this most important work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Carefully and with painstaking accuracy he showed Gabriel how the plant
    </p>
    <p>
     now embraced more than two square miles of territory around the Falls,
    </p>
    <p>
     all guarded by tremendous barricades mounting machine-guns and
    </p>
    <p>
     search-lights. On both sides of the river this huge monster had
    </p>
    <p>
     squatted, effectually shutting out all sight of the Falls and depriving
    </p>
    <p>
     the people of their birthright of beauty, at the same time that it had
    </p>
    <p>
     harnessed the vast waterpower to the task of enslaving the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     "From the Grand Trunk steel arch bridge up to and including the former
    </p>
    <p>
     plant of the Niagara Falls Power Company," said Brevard, "you see the
    </p>
    <p>
     plant extends. And, on the Canadian side--or what was the Canadian,
    </p>
    <p>
     before 'we' absorbed Canada--it stretches from the Ontario Power
    </p>
    <p>
     Company's works to those of the Toronto-Niagara Power Company, including
    </p>
    <p>
     both. In addition to having absorbed these, it has taken over the
    </p>
    <p>
     Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company, the Canadian
    </p>
    <p>
     Power Company and half a dozen others, and has, as you see, established
    </p>
    <p>
     its central offices and plant on Goat Island.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here Flint and Waldron have what may be called a citadel within a
    </p>
    <p>
     citadel--twelve acres of administration buildings, laboratories (in
    </p>
    <p>
     charge of your old friend Herzog, by the way!) and experimental works,
    </p>
    <p>
     including also the big steel chambers, vacuum-lined, where they are
    </p>
    <p>
     already storing their liquid oxygen to be turned into their pipe-lines
    </p>
    <p>
     and tank-cars. This Goat Island central plant will be the real kernel in
    </p>
    <p>
     the nut, Gabriel. Once _that_ is gone, you'll have ripped the heart out
    </p>
    <p>
     of the beast, smashed the vital ganglia, and given the world the
    </p>
    <p>
     respite, the breathing-space it must have, to free itself!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And if I don't?" asked Gabriel. "If anything happens to upset our
    </p>
    <p>
     blockading tactics, or if our attacking forces are defeated or our
    </p>
    <p>
     aeroplanes shot down, what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then," said Brevard, slowly, "then the world had better die than
    </p>
    <p>
     survive under the abominable slavery now impending. Already the
    </p>
    <p>
     pipe-lines have been laid to Buffalo, Cleveland, Albany and Scranton.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already they're under way to New York City itself, and to Cincinnati.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already other plants have been projected for Chicago, Denver, San
    </p>
    <p>
     Francisco and New Orleans, to say nothing of half a dozen in the Old
    </p>
    <p>
     World. At this present moment, as we all sit here in this quiet room on
    </p>
    <p>
     this remote mountain-slope, the world's air is being cornered! All the
    </p>
    <p>
     atmospheric nitrogen is planned for, by Flint and Waldron, to pass under
    </p>
    <p>
     their control--and with it, every crop that grows. All the oxygen will
    </p>
    <p>
     follow. They're already having their domestic-service apparatus
    </p>
    <p>
     manufactured--their cold-pipe radiators, meters, evaporators and
    </p>
    <p>
     respirators. I tell you, comrades, this thing is close upon us, not as a
    </p>
    <p>
     theory, now, but as a terrible, an inconceivably ghastly reality!
    </p>
    <p>
     "Even as we talk this thing over, those devils in human form are at
    </p>
    <p>
     work impoverishing the atmosphere, the very basis of all life. My
    </p>
    <p>
     oxymeter, today, showed a diminution of .047 per cent. in the amount of
    </p>
    <p>
     free oxygen in the air right on this mountain. And their plant is hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     running yet! Wait till they get it under full swing--wait till their
    </p>
    <p>
     pipe-lines and tanks and instruments and all their vast, infernal
    </p>
    <p>
     apparatus of exploitation and enslavement are in operation! Even in a
    </p>
    <p>
     week from now, or less, by the time you issue the call, Gabriel, you may
    </p>
    <p>
     see wretches gasping in vain for breath, in some dark alley of Niagara
    </p>
    <p>
     where the air is being drained!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, devilish and infernal plot against the world!" said Gabriel,
    </p>
    <p>
     bitterly. "Yet in essence, after all, no different from the system of
    </p>
    <p>
     ten years ago, which kept food and shelter, light and fuel, under lock
    </p>
    <p>
     and key--and made the dollar the only key to fit the lock! Yet this
    </p>
    <p>
     seems worse, somehow; and though I die for it, my last supreme blow
    </p>
    <p>
     shall be against such unutterable, such murderous villainy! So then,
    </p>
    <p>
     comrades--"
    </p>
    <p>
     He paused, suddenly, as Kate laid a hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hark! What's that?" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside, somewhere, a sound had made itself heard. Then on the porch, a
    </p>
    <p>
     loose board creaked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel sprang to his feet. The others stood up and faced the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In heaven's name, what's that outside?" demanded Craig.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the instant, a heavy foot crashed through the panels of their door.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door, burst open, flew back.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the aperture, stood a man, in aviator's dress, with another dimly
    </p>
    <p>
     visible behind him. Both these men held long, blue-nosed,
    </p>
    <p>
     oxygen-bullet-shooting revolvers levelled at the little group around the
    </p>
    <p>
     table.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My God! Air Trust spies!" cried Grantham, pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hands up, you!" shouted the man in the doorway, with a wild triumph in
    </p>
    <p>
     his voice. "You're caught, all of you! Not a move, you ---- ---- ----!
    </p>
    <p>
     Hands up!"
    </p>
   </div>

     CHAPTER XXXI.
    </head>
    <p>
     ESCAPE!
    </p>
    <p>
     Quick as thought, at sound of the imperative summons and sight of the
    </p>
    <p>
     levelled weapons, Gabriel swept up most of the papers and crammed them
    </p>
    <p>
     into the breast of his loose flannel shirt, then dashed the lamp to the
    </p>
    <p>
     floor, extinguishing it. The room grew dark, for now the fire had burned
    </p>
    <p>
     down to hardly more than glowing coals.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no panic; the men did not curse, neither did the women scream.
    </p>
    <p>
     As though the tactic had already been agreed on, Craig tipped the table
    </p>
    <p>
     up, making a kind of barricade; and over it Grantham's revolver,
    </p>
    <p>
     snatched from his belt, spat viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
     It all happened in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     The foremost spy grunted, coughed and plunged forward. As he fell, he
    </p>
    <p>
     fired his terrible weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bullet--a small, thin metal shell, filled with a secret chemical and
    </p>
    <p>
     liquid oxygen--went wild. It struck the wall, some feet to the left of
    </p>
    <p>
     the fireplace, and instantly the wood burst into vivid flame. Flesh
    </p>
    <p>
     would crisp to nothing, solid stone would crumble, metal would gutter
    </p>
    <p>
     and run down, under that awful incandescence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again Grantham's revolver barked, while Bevard tugged at his own, which
    </p>
    <p>
     had unaccountably got stuck in its holster. But this second shot missed.
    </p>
    <p>
     And even as Grantham's bullet snicked a long splinter from the
    </p>
    <p>
     door-jamb, the second spy fired.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brevard's choking cry died as the gushing flame enveloped him. He
    </p>
    <p>
     staggered, flung up both arms and fell stone dead, the life seared clean
    </p>
    <p>
     out of him, as a lamp sears a moth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gasping, blinded, the others scattered; and for the third time--while
    </p>
    <p>
     the room now glowed with this unquenchable blossoming of flame--Grantham
    </p>
    <p>
     shot.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spy's body burst into a sheaf of fire. Up past the lintel streamed
    </p>
    <p>
     the burning swirl. Mute and annihilated, his charred body dropped beside
    </p>
    <p>
     that of his mate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The total time from challenge to complete victory had not exceeded ten
    </p>
    <p>
     seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I exploded some of his cartridges!" choked Grantham. shielding his wife
    </p>
    <p>
     from the glare, while Gabriel protected Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
     "His--his cartridge belt!" gasped Craig.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes! And now, out--out of here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Brevard? We must save his body!" cried Gabriel, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Impossible!" shouted Grantham. "That hellish compound will burn for
    </p>
    <p>
     hours! And in three minutes this whole place will be a roaring furnace!
    </p>
    <p>
     Out of here--out--away! We must save the hangar, at all hazards!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Against their will, but absolutely unable to approach the now
    </p>
    <p>
     wildly-roaring fire on the floor that marked the spot where Brevard had
    </p>
    <p>
     fallen in the Battle with Plutocracy, the comrades quickly retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Raging fire now hemmed them on three sides. Their only avenue of escape
    </p>
    <p>
     was through the eastern windows, eight or ten feet above the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hastily snatching up such of the plans and papers as he had not already
    </p>
    <p>
     secured--and some of these already were beginning to smoke and turn
    </p>
    <p>
     brown, in the infernal heat--Gabriel shielded Catherine's retreat. The
    </p>
    <p>
     others followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Craig and Grantham first jumped from the windows, then caught Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grantham and Catherine as Gabriel helped them to escape. He himself was
    </p>
    <p>
     the last to leave the room, now a raging furnace. Together they all ran
    </p>
    <p>
     from the building, and none too soon; for suddenly the roof collapsed, a
    </p>
    <p>
     tremendous burst of crackling flames and sheaved sparks leaped high
    </p>
    <p>
     above the tree-tops, and the walls came crashing in.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the welter of incandescence, where now only the stone chimney
    </p>
    <p>
     stood--and this, too, was already cracking and swaying--Brevard had
    </p>
    <p>
     found his tomb, together with the two Air Trust spies. All that
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasant, necessary place was now a mass of white-hot ruin; all those
    </p>
    <p>
     books and pictures now had turned to ash.
    </p>
    <p>
     The five remaining comrades paused by the hangar, and looked mournfully
    </p>
    <p>
     back at the still-leaping volcano of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Poor Brevard! Poor old chap!" said Craig. He peered at the women.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither one was crying--they were not that type--but both were pale.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't feel that way," said Gabriel. "Brevard is not to be pitied.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's to be envied! He died in the noblest war we can conceive--the war
    </p>
    <p>
     for the human race! And his last act was to take part in a battle that
    </p>
    <p>
     stamped out two vipers, Air Trust spies, who would have joyed to burn us
    </p>
    <p>
     all alive!"
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: The spy's body burst into a sheaf of fire.]
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank God, I got the Hell-hounds!" muttered Craig. "Two less of Slade's
    </p>
    <p>
     infamous army, anyhow." Though Gabriel knew it not, the first one to
    </p>
    <p>
     fall was the same who had battled with him in the trap at Rochester, the
    </p>
    <p>
     same who had trailed him when he, Gabriel, had left the Federal pen. So
    </p>
    <p>
     one score, at least, was settled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They're gone, anyhow," said Gabriel, "and five of us still live--and
    </p>
    <p>
     I've still got the plans and all. Moreover, the monoplanes are safe. The
    </p>
    <p>
     quicker we get away from here, now, the better. Away, and to our last
    </p>
    <p>
     remaining refuge near Port Colborne, on the shores of Lake Erie. Other
    </p>
    <p>
     Air Trust forces may be here, before morning. We must get away!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A frightful shock awaited them when, entering the hangar--eager now to
    </p>
    <p>
     escape at once from the scene of the tragedy--they beheld their
    </p>
    <p>
     aeroplanes.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the ruddy light which shone in through the wide doors, from the fire,
    </p>
    <p>
     they saw long strips and tatters of canvas hanging from the 'planes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Smashed! Broken! Wrecked!" cried Gabriel, starting back aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
     The others stared. Only too true; the monoplanes were practically
    </p>
    <p>
     destroyed. Not only had the spies, before attacking the refuge, slashed
    </p>
    <p>
     the 'planes to rags, but they had also partly dismantled the motors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bits of machinery lay scattered on the floor of the hangar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stunned and unable to gather speech or coherent thought, the five
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialists stood staring. Then, after a moment, Craig made shift to
    </p>
    <p>
     exclaim bitterly:
    </p>
    <p>
     "A good job, all right! The curs must have got in at the window, and
    </p>
    <p>
     spent an hour in this work. Whatever happened, they didn't intend we
    </p>
    <p>
     should have any means of retreat--for of course it's out of the question
    </p>
    <p>
     for anybody to get away from here through the forest over the ridges
    </p>
    <p>
     and down the cliffs!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "They meant to trap us, this way, that's certain," added Gabriel. "There
    </p>
    <p>
     surely will be others of the same breed, here before morning. They must
    </p>
    <p>
     not find us here!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "But Gabriel, how shall we escape?" asked Catherine, her face illumined
    </p>
    <p>
     by the leaping flames of the bungalow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How! In their own machine! The machine that Slade and the Air Trust
    </p>
    <p>
     secret-service gave them, to come here and catch or murder us!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the Almighty! So we will!" cried Grantham. "Come on, let's find it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The little party hurried off toward the landing-ground, a cleared and
    </p>
    <p>
     levelled space further up the mountainside. The light of the burning
    </p>
    <p>
     bungalow helped show them their path; and Craig had also taken an
    </p>
    <p>
     electric flash-lamp from the hangar. With this he led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right! There it is!" suddenly exclaimed Gabriel, pointing. Craig
    </p>
    <p>
     painted a brush of electric light over the vague outlines of the Air
    </p>
    <p>
     Trust machine, a steel racer of the latest kind.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A Floriot biplane," said he. "Will hold two and a passenger. Familiar
    </p>
    <p>
     type. I guess all of us, here, can operate it."
    </p>
    <p>
     They all--even the women--could. For you must understand that after the
    </p>
    <p>
     Great Massacres had foreshown the only possible trend the Movement could
    </p>
    <p>
     take, practically all the leaders in the work had studied aeronautics,
    </p>
    <p>
     also chemistry, as most essential branches of knowledge in the
    </p>
    <p>
     inevitable war.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Two, and a passenger," repeated Gabriel, as though echoing Craig's
    </p>
    <p>
     words. "Who goes first?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You!" said Grantham. "You and Catherine, with Craig to bring the
    </p>
    <p>
     machine back. You're needed, now, at the front--imperatively needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Freda and I," gesturing at his wife, "will hold the fort, here--will
    </p>
    <p>
     keep watch over our dead, over poor old Brevard, the first to fall in
    </p>
    <p>
     this great, final battle!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A spirited argument followed. Gabriel insisted on being left for the
    </p>
    <p>
     second trip. A compromise was made by having him get the two women out
    </p>
    <p>
     of danger, at once, leaving Craig and Grantham on the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll send Hazen or Keyes back with the 'plane, for you," said he, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     climbed into the driving seat, after the passengers had been stowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That will be tomorrow night. Of course, we daren't fly by day. And
    </p>
    <p>
     mind," he added, adjusting his spark and throttle, "mind you meet me
    </p>
    <p>
     with this very same machine, safe and sound, at the Lake Erie refuge!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why this same machine?" inquired Craig.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why? Because I intend to use this, and no other, in the final attack.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could poetic justice be finer than that the Air Trust works be destroyed
    </p>
    <p>
     with the help of one of their own 'planes?"
    </p>
    <p>
     No more was said, save brief good-byes. Those were times when
    </p>
    <p>
     demonstrativeness, whether in life or death, was at a discount. A
    </p>
    <p>
     hand-clasp and a few last instructions as to the time and place of
    </p>
    <p>
     meeting, sufficed. Then Gabriel pressed the button of the self-starter
    </p>
    <p>
     and opened the throttle.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sudden gusty chatter, the engine caught. A great wind sprang up,
    </p>
    <p>
     from the roaring, whirling blades. The Floriot rolled easily forward,
    </p>
    <p>
     speeded up, and gathered headway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel suddenly rotated the rising-plane. The great gull soared,
    </p>
    <p>
     careened and took the air with majestic power. The watchers on the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain-side saw its hooded lights, that glowed upon its compass and
    </p>
    <p>
     barometric-gauge, slowly spiralling upward, ever upward, as Gabriel
    </p>
    <p>
     climbed with his two passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the lights sped forward, northward, in a long tangent, and, as they
    </p>
    <p>
     swiftly diminished to mere specks, the echo of a farewell hail drifted
    </p>
    <p>

     Craig turned to Grantham, when the last gleam of light had faded in a
    </p>

     swift trajectory.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God grant they reach the last remaining refuge safely!" said he, with
    </p>
    <p>
     deep emotion. "And may their flight be quick and sure! For the fate of
    </p>
    <p>
     the world, its hope and its salvation from infinite enslavement, are
    </p>
    <p>
     whirling through the trackless wastes of air, to-night!"

    <p>
     OMINOUS DEVELOPMENTS.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first intimation that Flint and Waldron had of any opposition to
    </p>
    <p>
     their plans, of any revolt, of any danger, was at quarter past three on
    </p>
    <p>
     the afternoon of October 8th, 1925. All that afternoon, busy with their
    </p>
    <p>
     final plans for the immediate extension of their system, they had been
    </p>
    <p>
     going over certain data with Herzog, receiving reports from branch
    </p>
    <p>
     managers and conferring with the Congressional committee that--together
    </p>
    <p>
     with Dillon Slade, their secret-service tool, now also President
    </p>
    <p>
     Supple's private secretary--they had peremptorily summoned from
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington to receive instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the more than four years that had passed since they had put Gabriel
    </p>
    <p>
     behind bars--years fruitful in strikes and lockouts, in prostitutions of
    </p>
    <p>
     justice, in sluggings and crude massacres--both men had altered notably.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the National Censorship now no longer permitted any cartooning of
    </p>
    <p>
     a "seditious" nature, i.e., representing any of the Air Trust notables,
    </p>
    <p>
     old Flint's features tempted the artist's pencil more than ever. Save
    </p>
    <p>
     for a little white fringe of hair at the back of his head, he had become
    </p>
    <p>
     almost bald, thus adding greatly to his strong suggestion of a vulture.
    </p>
    <p>
     His face was now more yellow and shrunken than ever, due to a rather
    </p>
    <p>
     heavier consumption of his favorite drug, morphine; his nose had hooked
    </p>
    <p>
     more strongly, and his one gold tooth of other days now had two more to
    </p>
    <p>
     bear it company. His eyes, too, behind his thick pince-nez, had grown
    </p>
    <p>
     more shifty, cold and cruelly calculating. If it be possible to conceive
    </p>
    <p>
     a fox, a buzzard and a jackal merged in one, old Isaac Flint today
    </p>
    <p>
     represented that unnatural and hideous hybrid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, as he stood facing "Tiger" Waldron, in the inner and sancrosanct
    </p>
    <p>
     office of the Air Trust plant at Niagara--the office that even the
    </p>
    <p>
     President of these United States approached with deference and due
    </p>
    <p>
     humility--the snarl on his face revealed the beast-soul of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damnation!" he was saying, as he shook a newly-received aerogram at his
    </p>
    <p>
     partner. "What's this, I'd like to know? What does this mean? All
    </p>
    <p>
     telegraphic communication west of Chicago has suddenly stopped, and from
    </p>
    <p>
     half a dozen points in the Southern States news is coming in that
    </p>
    <p>
     railway service is being interrupted! See here, Waldron, this won't do!
    </p>
    <p>
     Your part of the business has always been to carry on the publicity end,
    </p>
    <p>
     the newspaper end, the moulding of public opinion and political thought,
    </p>
    <p>
     _and_ the maintenance of free, clear rail and aero communication
    </p>
    <p>
     everywhere, all over the world. But now, all at once, see here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron raised red, bleared eyes at his irate partner. He, too, was more
    </p>
    <p>
     the beast than four years ago. No less the tiger, now, but more the pig.
    </p>
    <p>
     High, evil living had done its work on him. An unhealthy purple suffused
    </p>
    <p>
     his heavily-jowled face. Beneath his eyes, sodden bags of flesh hung
    </p>
    <p>
     pendant. His lips, loose and lascivious, now sucked indolently at the
    </p>
    <p>
     costly cigar he was smoking as he sat leaning far back in his
    </p>
    <p>
     desk-chair. And so those two, angry accuser and indifferent accused,
    </p>
    <p>
     faced each other for a moment; while, incessant, dull, mighty, the
    </p>
    <p>
     thunders of the giant cataract mingled with the trembling diapason of
    </p>
    <p>
     the stupendous turbines in the rock-hewn caverns where old Niagara now
    </p>
    <p>
     toiled in fetters, to swell their power and fling gold into their
    </p>
    <p>
     bottomless coffers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "See here!" Flint repeated angrily, once more shaking the dispatches at
    </p>
    <p>
     his mate. "Even our wireless system, all over the west and southwest,
    </p>
    <p>
     has quit working! And you sit there staring at me like--like--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That'll do, Flint!" the younger man retorted in a rough, hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If there's any trouble, I'll find it and repair it. Very well. But I'll
    </p>
    <p>
     not be talked to in any such way. Damn it, you can't speak to me Flint,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if I were one of the people! If you own half the earth, I'll have you
    </p>
    <p>
     understand I own the other half. So go easy, Flint--go damned easy!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Malevolently he eyed the old man's beast-like face. The scorn and
    </p>
    <p>
     dislike he had conceived for Flint, years ago, when Flint had failed to
    </p>
    <p>
     win back Catherine to him, had long grown keener and more bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron took it as a personal affront that Flint, apparently so worn and
    </p>
    <p>
     feeble, could still hang on to life and brains enough to dominate the
    </p>
    <p>
     enterprise. A thousand times, if once, he had wished Flint well dead and
    </p>
    <p>
     buried and out of the way, so that he, Waldron, could grasp the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     circle of the stupendous Air Trust. This, his supreme ambition, had been
    </p>
    <p>
     constantly curbed by Flint's survival; and as the months and years had
    </p>
    <p>
     passed, his hate had grown more deep, more ugly, more venomous.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why, curse it," Waldron often thought, "the old dope has taken enough
    </p>
    <p>
     morphine in his lifetime to have killed a hundred ordinary men! And yet
    </p>
    <p>
     he still clings on, and withers, and grows yellow like an old dead leaf
    </p>
    <p>
     that will not drop from the tree! When _will_ he drop? When _will_
    </p>
    <p>
     Father Time pick the despicable antique? My God, is the man immortal?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Such being the usual tenor of his thoughts, concerning Flint, small
    </p>
    <p>
     wonder that he took the old man's chiding with an ill grace, and warned
    </p>
    <p>
     him pointedly not to continue it. Now, facing the Billionaire, he fairly
    </p>
    <p>
     stared him out of countenance. An awkward silence followed. Both heard,
    </p>
    <p>
     with relief, a rapping at the office door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come!" snapped Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
     A clerk appeared, with a yellow envelope in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Another wireless, sir," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint snatched it from him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Send Herzog and Slade, at once," he commanded, as he ripped the
    </p>
    <p>
     envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, more trouble?" insolently drawled "Tiger" happy in the paling of
    </p>
    <p>
     the old man's face and the sudden look of apprehension there.
    </p>
    <p>
     For all answer, Flint handed him the message. Waldron read:
    </p>
    <p>
     Southern and Gulf States all seemingly cut off from every kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     communication this P.M. Can get no news. Is this according to your
    </p>
    <p>
     orders? If not, can you inform me probable cause? I ask
    </p>
    <p>
     instructions. "K."
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence, a minute, then Waldron whistled, and began pulling at his thick
    </p>
    <p>
     lower lip, a sure sign of perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the Almighty, Flint" said he. "I--maybe I was wrong just now, to be
    </p>
    <p>
     so confoundedly touchy about--about what you said. This--certainly looks
    </p>
    <p>
     odd, doesn't it? It _can't_ be a series of coincidences! There must be
    </p>
    <p>
     something back of it, all. But--but _what_? Rebellion is out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     question, now, and has been for a long time. Revolution? The way we're
    </p>
    <p>
     organized, the very idea's an absurdity! But, if not these, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint stared at him with drug-contracted eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, that's the question," he rapped out. "What can it mean? Ah,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps Slade can tell us," he added, as the secret-service man quietly
    </p>
    <p>
     entered through a private door at the rear of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell you what, gentlemen?" asked Slade, smirking and rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The meaning of that, and that, and _that_!" snapped old Flint,
    </p>
    <p>
     thrusting the telegrams at the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm!" grunted the secret-service man, as he glanced them over. "That's
    </p>
    <p>
     damned odd! But it's of no real moment. If--if there's really any
    </p>
    <p>
     trouble, any outbreak or what not, of course it can't amount to
    </p>
    <p>
     anything. All you have to do is order the President to call out the
    </p>
    <p>
     troops, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I can order him, all right," snarled Flint, "but in case all our
    </p>
    <p>
     wires are down and all our wireless plants put out of commission, to say
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing of our transport service interrupted, what then? There's no
    </p>
    <p>
     doubt in _my_ mind, Slade, that another upheaval is upon us. The fact
    </p>
    <p>
     that we stamped out the 1918 and 1922 uprisings, and that rivers ran red
    </p>
    <p>
     and city streets were flushed with blood, apparently hasn't made any
    </p>
    <p>
     impression on the cattle! Damn it all, I say, _can't_ you keep things
    </p>
    <p>
     quiet? _Can't_ you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     In a very frenzy he paced the office, his face twitching, his bony
    </p>
    <p>
     fingers snapping with the extremity of his agitation. Suddenly he faced
    </p>
    <p>
     Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
     "See here, you!" he exclaimed. "This certainly means another uprising.
    </p>
    <p>
     It can't mean anything else! And you've allowed it, you hear? No, no,
    </p>
    <p>
     don't deny the fact!" he cried, as the detective tried to oppose a word
    </p>
    <p>
     of self-defense. "It's your fault, at last analysis; and if anything
    </p>
    <p>
     happens, you and the President, Supple, have got to answer to me,
    </p>
    <p>
     personally, do you hear? You've got to pay!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pay, and with devilish big interest, too!" growled "Tiger," fixing his
    </p>
    <p>
     bleared, savage eyes on Slade.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What did I make that man President for, anyhow?" snarled Flint, "if not
    </p>
    <p>
     to do my bidding and keep things still? Why did I put you in as his
    </p>
    <p>
     private secretary, if not to have you watch him and see that he _did_ do
    </p>
    <p>
     my bidding? Why did I have Congress pass all those bills and things,
    </p>
    <p>
     except to give you the weapons and tools to hold the lid on?
    </p>
    <p>
     "You've had a huge army and a conscripted militia given you; and
    </p>
    <p>
     hundreds of wireless plants, and military roads and war-equipment beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     all calculating. You've had thousands of spies organized and put under
    </p>
    <p>
     your control. At your suggestion I've had all political power taken away
    </p>
    <p>
     from the dogs--and everything done that you've asked for--and this,
    </p>
    <p>
     _this_ is the kind of work you do!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Livid with rage, the old Billionaire stood there shaking by his desk,
    </p>
    <p>
     his face a fearful mask of passions and evil lusts for vengeance and
    </p>
    <p>
     power. Slade, recognizing his master, even as President Supple on more
    </p>
    <p>
     than one occasion had been forced in terrible personal interviews to
    </p>
    <p>
     recognize him, said no word; but in the secret-service man's eyes a
    </p>
    <p>
     brutal gleam flashed its message of hate and loathing. Foul as Slade
    </p>
    <p>
     was, he balked at times, in face of this man's cruel and naked savagery.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I tell you," continued Flint, now having recovered his breath, "I tell
    </p>
    <p>
     you, you're worse than useless, you and your President, ha!
    </p>
    <p>
     ha!--President Puppet, indeed! Take that great Smoky Mountain clue, for
    </p>
    <p>
     instance! On the rumor that the ring-leaders of the swine were up there,
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhere, in the North Carolina mountains, you sent your two best men.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what's the latest news? What have you to tell me? _You_ know! Other
    </p>
    <p>
     airmen of yours have just reported that nothing can be found but ruins
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Socialist refuge, there--nothing but those, and the half-melted
    </p>
    <p>
     vanadium steel identification-tags of your best scouts! _And_ their
    </p>
    <p>
     machine is gone--and with it, the birds we wanted! Then, close on the
    </p>
    <p>
     heels of this, all wires go flat, all wireless breaks down, all rails
    </p>
    <p>
     are interrupted, and--and Hell's to pay!" Fair in Slade's face he shook
    </p>
    <p>
     his trembling first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Urrh! You devilish, impotent faker! You four-flusher! You toy
    </p>
    <p>
     detective! You and your President, too, aren't worth the liquid oxygen
    </p>
    <p>
     to blow you to Hades! See here, Slade, you get out on this job, now, and
    </p>
    <p>
     do it damned quick, you understand, or there'll be _some_ shake-up in
    </p>
    <p>
     your office and in the White House, too. When I buy and pay for tools, I
    </p>
    <p>
     insist that the tools work. If they don't--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He snatched up a pencil from the desk, broke it in half and threw the
    </p>
    <p>
     pieces on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Like that!" said he, and stamped on them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron nodded approval.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just like that," he echoed, "and then some!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go, now!" Flint commanded, pointing at the door. "Inside an hour, I
    </p>
    <p>
     want some reports, and I want them to be satisfactory. If you and Supple
    </p>
    <p>
     can't get things open again, and start the troops and machine-guns
    </p>
    <p>
     before then, look out! That's all I've got to say. Now, _go_!"

    </head>
    <p>
     "NOW COMES THE HOUR SUPREME."
    </p>
    <p>
     Hardly had the secret-service man taken his leave, slinking away like a
    </p>
    <p>
     whipped cur, yet with an ugly snarl that presaged evil, when Herzog
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come here," said Flint, curtly, heated with his burst of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir," the scientist replied, approaching. "What is it, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Still shifty and cringing was he, in presence of the masters; though
    </p>
    <p>
     with the men beneath him, at the vast plant--and now his importance had
    </p>
    <p>
     grown till he controlled more than eight thousand--rumor declared him an
    </p>
    <p>
     intolerable tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me, Herzog, what's the condition of the plant, at this present
    </p>
    <p>
     moment?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just how do you mean, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Suppose there were to be trouble, of any kind, how are we fixed for it?
    </p>
    <p>
     How's the oxygen supply, and--and everything? Good God, man, unlimber!
    </p>
    <p>
     You're paid to know things and tell 'em. Now, talk."
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus adjured, Herzog washed his hands with imaginary soap and in a
    </p>
    <p>
     deprecating voice began:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Trouble, sir? What trouble could there be? There's not the faintest
    </p>
    <p>
     sign of any organization among the men. They're submissive as so many
    </p>
    <p>
     rabbits, sir, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn you, shut up!" roared Flint. "I didn't summon you to come up here
    </p>
    <p>
     and give me a lecture on labor conditions at the works! The trouble I
    </p>
    <p>
     refer to is possible outside interference. Maybe some kind of wild-eyed
    </p>
    <p>
     Socialist upheaval, or attack, or what not. In case it comes, what's our
    </p>
    <p>
     condition? Tell me, in a few words, and for God's sake keep to the
    </p>
    <p>
     point! The way you wander, and always have, gives me the creeps!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog ventured nothing in reply to this outburst, save a conciliatory
    </p>
    <p>
     leer. Then, collecting his thoughts, he began:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, sir, in a general way, our condition is perfect. We've got two
    </p>
    <p>
     regiments of rifle and machine gunmen, half of them equipped with the
    </p>
    <p>
     oxygen bullets. I guarantee that I could have them away from their
    </p>
    <p>
     benches and machines, and on the fortifications, inside of fifteen
    </p>
    <p>
     minutes. Slade's armed guards, 2,500 or so, are all ready, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then, beside that, there are eight 'planes in the hangars, and plenty
    </p>
    <p>
     of men to take them up. If you wish, sir, I can have others brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
     The aerial-bomb guns are ready. As for the oxygen supply, Tanks F and L
    </p>
    <p>
     are full, K is half filled, and N and Q each have about 6,000 gallons,
    </p>
    <p>
     making a total of--let's see, sir--a total of just about 755,000
    </p>
    <p>
     gallons."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How protected? Have you got those bomb-proof overhead nets on, yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not yet, sir. That is, not over all the lines of tanks. We ran short of
    </p>
    <p>
     steel wire, last week, and have only got eight of the tanks under
    </p>
    <p>
     netting. But the work is going on fast, sir, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rush it! At all hazards, get nets over the rest of the tanks. If
    </p>
    <p>
     anything happens, through this delay, remember, Herzog, I shall hold
    </p>
    <p>
     you personally responsible, and it will go hard with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, sir; thank you, sir," murmured the servile wretch. "Anything else,
    </p>
    <p>
     sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint thought a moment, glaring at Herzog with angry eyes, then shook
    </p>
    <p>
     his head in negation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very well, sir," said Herzog, withdrawing. "I'll go to work at once. By
    </p>
    <p>
     tomorrow, everything will be safe, I guarantee."
    </p>
    <p>
     He closed the door softly--as softly as he had spoken--as softly as he
    </p>
    <p>
     always did everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint glared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The sneaking whelp!" he murmured. "He makes my very flesh crawl. I wish
    </p>
    <p>
     to heaven he weren't so essential to us; we'd let him go, damned quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You forget," put in Tiger, "that he knows too much to be let go, ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, he's a fixture. And now, dismiss him from your mind, and let's go
    </p>
    <p>
     over those telegrams and radiograms again. If there _is_ a new Socialist
    </p>
    <p>
     revolt under way--and I admit it certainly begins to look like it--we've
    </p>
    <p>
     got to understand the situation. Slade will have some more reports for
    </p>
    <p>
     us, in an hour or so. Till then, these must suffice."
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, curbing his agitation, sat down at the big table and turned on
    </p>
    <p>
     the vacuum-glow light, for the October afternoon was foggy--a fog that
    </p>
    <p>
     mingled with the spray of the vast Falls and hung heavy over the
    </p>
    <p>
     world--and already daylight was beginning to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fools!" he muttered to himself. "Fools, to think they can rebel against
    </p>
    <p>
     _us_! Ants would have just as much show of success, charging elephants,
    </p>
    <p>
     as _they_ have against the Air Trust! By tomorrow they'll be wiped out,
    </p>
    <p>
     smeared out, shattered and annihilated, whoever and wherever they are.
    </p>
    <p>
     By tomorrow, at the latest. Again I say, blind, suicidal fools!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right you are," assented Waldron, drawing up his chair. "They don't
    </p>
    <p>
     seem to realize, even yet, that we own the whole round earth and all
    </p>
    <p>
     that is in it. They don't understand that their rebelling is like a
    </p>
    <p>
     tribe of naked savages going against a modern army with explosive
    </p>
    <p>
     bullets. Ah, well, let them learn, let them learn! It takes a whip to
    </p>
    <p>
     teach a cur. Let them feel the lash, and learn!..."
    </p>
    <p>
     At this same hour, in the last retreat, near Port Colborne, in the State
    </p>
    <p>
     of Ontario--once a province of Canada--half a dozen grim and determined
    </p>
    <p>
     men were gathered together. We already recognize Craig, Grantham and
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel. The other three, like them, all wore the Socialist button and
    </p>
    <p>
     the little tab of red ribbon that marked them as members of the Fighting
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tonight," Gabriel was saying, as he stood there in the gathering
    </p>
    <p>
     dusk--they dared not show a light, even behind the drawn curtains of
    </p>
    <p>
     their refuge--"tonight, comrades, the final die is cast. Everything is
    </p>
    <p>
     ready, or as nearly ready as we shall ever be able to make it. Our
    </p>
    <p>
     reports already show that every line of communication has been broken by
    </p>
    <p>
     one swift, sharp blow. True, in a few hours all these avenues can be
    </p>
    <p>
     opened up again. By morning, the Niagara works will be in receipt of
    </p>
    <p>
     messages; trains will be running; the troop-planes will be carrying
    </p>
    <p>
     their hordes at the command of Flint. By morning, yes. But in the
    </p>
    <p>
     meantime--"
    </p>
    <p>
     He spread his fingers, upward, with an expressive gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By morning," Craig mumbled, "what will there be left to protect?"
    </p>
    <p>
     A little silence followed. Each was busy with his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     All at once, one of the three newcomers spoke--a tall, light-haired
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow, he seemed, in that dim light, with a strong Southern accent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pardon me for asking, Gabriel," said he, removing a pipe from his
    </p>
    <p>
     mouth, "or for discussing details familiar to you all. But, coming as I
    </p>
    <p>
     _have_ come direct from the New Orleans refuge--they blew it up, last
    </p>
    <p>
     week, you know--of course I haven't got things as clearly in mind yet,
    </p>
    <p>
     as you-all have. Now, as I understand it, while we manoeuvre over the
    </p>
    <p>
     plant, blow up the barricades and, if possible, 'get' the oxygen-tanks,
    </p>
    <p>
     our men on the ground will pour in through the gaps and storm the place,
    </p>
    <p>
     under the command of Edward Hargreaves. Is that the idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Exactly, Comrade Marion," answered Gabriel. "You've hit it to a T."
    </p>
    <p>
     Craig laughed grimly, as he drew at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just as we're going to hit those big tanks!" said he. "It's tonight or
    </p>
    <p>
     never, comrades. They're putting steel nets over them, already. By
    </p>
    <p>
     tomorrow the whole place will be protected by huge grill-work fully a
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred feet above the tops of the tanks. Oh, they seem to have thought
    </p>
    <p>
     of everything, those plutes! But they'll be just a shade too late, this
    </p>
    <p>
     time; just a shade too late!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Another silence, broken again by the tall Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just let me get this thing quite clear," said he. "We're to start at
    </p>
    <p>
     5:30, you say, walk past the Welland Canal Feeder out to the Monck
    </p>
    <p>
     Aviation Grounds, and find everything ready there?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Correct," said Gabriel. "All six of us. That's our part of the program.
    </p>
    <p>
     Comrades you don't know, out there--comrades in the employ of the Air
    </p>
    <p>
     Trust itself--will have six machines ready. One of them will be the very
    </p>
    <p>
     machine that they tried to get us with, in the Great Smokies! So you
    </p>
    <p>
     see, we're going to use the Air Trust equipment, their field and even
    </p>
    <p>
     their own telenite, to put them out of business forever and to free the
    </p>
    <p>
     world!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Poetic justice, all right enough!" laughed Marion. "At the same time
    </p>
    <p>
     that we're attacking from an elevation of perhaps three thousand feet,
    </p>
    <p>
     the lateral attack will be delivered. About how many men do you count,
    </p>
    <p>
     on, for that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," judged Gabriel, "within a ten-mile radius of the plant, at least
    </p>
    <p>
     a hundred thousand men are waiting, this very instant, with every nerve
    </p>
    <p>
     keyed up to fighting tension. Scattered in a vast variety of ingenious
    </p>
    <p>
     and cleverly-devised hiding places, with their chlorine grenades and
    </p>
    <p>
     their revolvers shooting little hydrocyanic acid gas bullets, they're
    </p>
    <p>
     waiting the signal--a rocket in mid-heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hydrocyanic acid gas!" exclaimed Marion, forgetting to smoke. "Why, one
    </p>
    <p>
     whiff of that is death!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is," agreed Gabriel. "Remember, this is a war of extermination. It's
    </p>
    <p>
     a case of _them_ or _us_! And if we're worsted, the whole world loses;
    </p>
    <p>
     while if they are, then liberty is born! That's why this gas is
    </p>
    <p>
     justifiable. They'll try to use oxygen-bullets on us, never fear. But
    </p>
    <p>
     where they can kill ten, with those, we can annihilate a hundred with
    </p>
    <p>
     our kind. Swine, they have called us, and fools and apes. Well, we
    </p>
    <p>
     shall see, we shall see, when it comes to an out-and-out fight between
    </p>
    <p>
     Plutocrat and Proletarian, who is the better man!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Again came silence. And this time it was Grantham who broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Comrades," said he, "after you've seen as many Socialists shot down as
    </p>
    <p>
     _I_ have--shot down and burned, as Brevard was--you'll lose any
    </p>
    <p>
     lingering ideas of civilized warfare you may still retain. They hunt us
    </p>
    <p>
     like beasts, prison us in foul traps, ride us down, crush us, break and
    </p>
    <p>
     tear us, and burn us alive, because we struggle to be free men and
    </p>
    <p>
     women, not slaves. Now that our hour has struck, now that their lines of
    </p>
    <p>
     communication and defense are breached, and they--though they still
    </p>
    <p>
     don't fully understand it--are penned there in their heaven-offending,
    </p>
    <p>
     monstrous, horrible plant at the Falls, no true man can hesitate to
    </p>
    <p>
     smash them down with no more compunction than as though they were so
    </p>
    <p>
     many rattlesnakes or scorpions!
    </p>
    <p>
     "This isn't 1915, when political and civil rights still existed, and we
    </p>
    <p>
     weren't hunted outlaws. This is 1925, and conditions are all different.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's war, war, war to the death, now; and if war is Hell, then _they_
    </p>
    <p>
     are going to get Hell this time, not we."
    </p>
    <p>
     Nobody spoke, for a little while; but Marion and Craig smoked
    </p>
    <p>
     contemplatively, and the others sat there in the dusk, sunk in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     All at once a door opened, and the vague form of a woman became visible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Comrades, you must go," said she. "It's nearly half past five. By the
    </p>
    <p>
     time you've got everything in readiness, you'll have no time to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right, Catherine," answered Gabriel. "Come, comrades! Up and at it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ten minutes later they all issued forth into the soft gloom. All were in
    </p>
    <p>
     aviator's dress, and each carried a parcel by a handle held with stout
    </p>
    <p>
     straps. Had you seen them, you would have noticed they took particular
    </p>
    <p>
     pains not to jar or shake these parcels, or approach unduly near each
    </p>
    <p>
     other.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the door of the refuge, Catherine said good-bye to each, and added
    </p>
    <p>
     some brave word of cheer. Her farewell to Gabriel was longer than to the
    </p>
    <p>
     others; and for a moment their hands met and clung.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go," she whispered, "go, and God bless you! Go even though it be to
    </p>
    <p>
     death! Their airmen will take toll of some of the attackers, Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not all the Comrades will return. Oh, may _you_--may _you_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is written on the Book of Fate, will be," he answered. "Our petty
    </p>
    <p>
     hopes and fears are nothing, Catherine. If death awaits me, it will be
    </p>
    <p>
     sweet; for it will come, tonight, in the supreme service of the human
    </p>
    <p>
     race! Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sudden motion, the girl took his face between her hands, and
    </p>
    <p>
     kissed his forehead. For all her courage and strength, he sensed her
    </p>
    <p>
     heart wildly beating and he felt her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good-bye, Gabriel," she breathed. "Would I might go with you! Would
    </p>
    <p>
     that my duty did not hold me here! Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he was gone, gone with the others, into the thickening obscurity of
    </p>
    <p>
     the fog-shrouded evening. Now Catherine stood there alone, head bowed
    </p>
    <p>
     and wet face hidden in both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the little fighting band disappeared, back to the girl drifted a few
    </p>
    <p>
     words of song, soft-hummed through the dusk--the deathless chorus of the
    </p>
    <p>
     International:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now comes the hour supreme!
    </p>
    <p>
     To arms, each in his place!
    </p>
    <p>
     The new dawn's International
    </p>
    <p>
     Shall be the human race!..."

    <p>
     THE ATTACK.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Halt! Who goes there?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The challenge rang sharply on the night air, outside a small gate in the
    </p>
    <p>
     barricade of the Monck Aviation Grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Liberty!" answered Gabriel, pausing as he gave the password.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All right, come on," said a vague figure at the gate. The little group
    </p>
    <p>
     approached. The gate opened. Silently they entered the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another man stepped from a hangar. In his hand he held an electric
    </p>
    <p>
     flash, which he threw upon the newcomers, one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right!" he commented, and took Gabriel by the hand. "This way!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ten minutes later, all of them were in the air, save only Gabriel, who
    </p>
    <p>
     insisted on staying till his entire squad had made a clean getaway. Then
    </p>
    <p>
     he too rose; and now in a long, swift line, the fighting squadron
    </p>
    <p>
     straightened away to north-eastward, on the twenty-mile run to Niagara.
    </p>
    <p>
     The night was foggy, chill and dark. All the aviators had instructions
    </p>
    <p>
     to fly not less than 2,500 feet high, to keep a careful lookout lest
    </p>
    <p>
     they collide, and to steer by the lights of the great Air Trust plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     For, misty though the heavens were, still Gabriel could see the dim glow
    </p>
    <p>
     of the tremendous aerial search-lights dominating Goat Island--lights
    </p>
    <p>
     of 5,000,000 candle-power, maintained by current from the Falls,
    </p>
    <p>
     incessantly sweeping the sky on the lookout for just such perils as now,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, were drawing near.
    </p>
    <p>
     Momently, as he flew, Gabriel perceived these huge lights growing
    </p>
    <p>
     brighter, through the mist, and apprehension won upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Incredibly strong!" he muttered to himself, as he glanced from his
    </p>
    <p>
     barometer to the shining fog ahead. "Even though the mist will be
    </p>
    <p>
     thicker over the Falls than anywhere else, there's a good possibility
    </p>
    <p>
     they may pierce it and pick us up--and _then_, look out for their
    </p>
    <p>
     'planes and swift, fighting dirigibles!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He rotated the rising-plane, and now soared to 2,800 feet. Below and on
    </p>
    <p>
     either side of him, nothing but tenuous fog. Ahead, the
    </p>
    <p>
     swiftly-approaching fan of radiance, white, dazzling, beautiful, that
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to gush from earth so far below and to the eastward. Already the
    </p>
    <p>
     thunders of the Falls were audible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where are the others?" Gabriel wondered, his thoughts seeming to hum
    </p>
    <p>
     and roar in his head, in harmony with the shuddering diapason of the
    </p>
    <p>
     muffler-deadened exhaust. "No way of telling, now. Each man for
    </p>
    <p>
     himself--and each to do his best!"
    </p>
    <p>
     And then his thoughts reverted to Catherine; and round his heart a
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden yearning seemed to strengthen his stern, indomitable
    </p>
    <p>
     resolve--"Victory or death!"
    </p>
    <p>
     But now there was scant time for thought. The moment of action was
    </p>
    <p>
     already close at hand. Far below there, hidden by night and dark and
    </p>
    <p>
     mist, Gabriel knew a hundred thousand comrades, of the Fighting
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections, were lying hidden, waiting for the signal to advance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And it's time, now!" he said aloud, thrilled by a wondrous sense of
    </p>
    <p>
     vast responsibility--a sense that on this moment hung the fate of the
    </p>
    <p>
     world. "It's time for the signal. Now then, up and at them!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking the rocket--a powerful affair, capable of casting an intense,
    </p>
    <p>
     calcium light--he touched the fuse to a bit of smouldering punk fastened
    </p>
    <p>
     in a metal cup at his right hand. Then, as it flared, he launched the
    </p>
    <p>
     rocket far into the void.
    </p>
    <p>
     Below, came a quick spurt of radiance, in a long, vivid streak that shot
    </p>
    <p>
     away with incredible rapidity. Gabriel followed it a moment, with his
    </p>
    <p>
     gaze, then smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Rubicon is crossed," said he. "The gates of the Temple of Janus are
    </p>
    <p>
     open wide--and now comes War!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He rose again, skimming to a still higher altitude as the glare of the
    </p>
    <p>
     great Works drew closer and closer underneath. The wind roared in his
    </p>
    <p>
     ears, louder than the whirling propellers. The whole fabric of the
    </p>
    <p>
     aeroplane quivered as it climbed, up, up above the rushing, bellowing
    </p>
    <p>
     cataract.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where are the others?" thought he, and reached for a thanatos
    </p>
    <p>
     projectile, in the rack near the metal cup where the punk still
    </p>
    <p>
     glowered.
    </p>
    <p>
     All at once, a glare of light burst upward through the white-glowing
    </p>
    <p>
     mist; and the 'plane reeled with the air-wave, as now a thunderous
    </p>
    <p>
     concussion boomed across the empty spaces of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same moment, a faint, ripping noise mounted to Gabriel--a sound
    </p>
    <p>
     for all the world like the tearing of stout canvas. Then followed a
    </p>
    <p>
     chattering racket, something like distant mowing-machines at work; and
    </p>
    <p>
     now all blent to a steady, determined uproar. Gabriel almost thought to
    </p>
    <p>
     hear, as he launched his own projectile, far sounds as of the shouts and
    </p>
    <p>
     cries of men; but of this he could not make sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They're at it, anyhow!" he exulted. "At it, at last! By the way our men
    </p>
    <p>
     have launched the attack, the first explosion must have breached a wall!
    </p>
    <p>
     God! What wouldn't I give to be down there, in the thick of it, rather
    </p>
    <p>
     than here! I--"
    </p>
    <p>
     _Crash_!
    </p>
    <p>
     Again a spouting geyser of light and uproar burst into mid-air.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That was _my_ thanatos speaking!" cried Gabriel. "Now for another!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Before he could drop it, as he circled round and round, directly over
    </p>
    <p>
     the great, flailing beams of the Air Trust search-lights, a third
    </p>
    <p>
     detonation shattered the heavens, nearly unseating him. Up sprang the
    </p>
    <p>
     roar, with wonderful intensity, reflected from the earth as from a giant
    </p>
    <p>
     sounding-board. And Gabriel noted, with keen satisfaction, that one of
    </p>
    <p>
     the huge light-beams had gone dark.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Put out _one_ of them, anyway, so far!" thought he, and swung again to
    </p>
    <p>
     westward, and once more dropped a messenger of death to tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the bombardment became general. Trust aerial-gun projectiles began
    </p>
    <p>
     bursting all about. Every second or two, terrible concussions leaped
    </p>
    <p>
     toward the zenith; and the earth, hidden somewhere down there below the
    </p>
    <p>
     fog-blanket, seemed flaming upward like a huge volcano. One by one the
    </p>
    <p>
     search-lights, whipping the sky, went black; and now the glow of them
    </p>
    <p>
     was fast diminishing, only to be replaced by a ruddier and more
    </p>
    <p>
     intermittent glare.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The plant's burning, at last," thought Gabriel. "Heaven grant the fire
    </p>
    <p>
     may spread to the oxygen-tanks! If we can only get _those_--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Again he launched a projectile, and again he circled over the doomed
    </p>
    <p>
     plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     A swift black shape swooped by him. He had just time to exchange a yell
    </p>
    <p>
     of warning, when it was gone. The near peril gripped his heart, but did
    </p>
    <p>
     not shake it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Close call!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
     If that machine and his had met, good-bye forever! But after all, the
    </p>
    <p>
     danger of collision in mid-air, or of being struck by a projectile from
    </p>
    <p>
     some other machine, above, was no greater than his comrades on the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground were facing. Not so great, perhaps. Many a one would meet his
    </p>
    <p>
     death from the aerial attack. In a war like this, a thousand perils
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened. Gabriel only hoped that Hargreaves, down below there, could
    </p>
    <p>
     hold them back, away, till the walls should have been destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Circling, ever circling, now hearing some echoes of the earth-battle,
    </p>
    <p>
     some grenade-volleys and rapid-fire clattering, now deafened and all but
    </p>
    <p>
     blinded by the vast, up-belching explosions of the thanatos projectiles,
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel flew among the drifting mists and vapors. Still was he guided by
    </p>
    <p>
     one or two search-lights; but most of these were gone, now. Yet the
    </p>
    <p>
     glare of the conflagration, below, was luridly shuddering through the
    </p>
    <p>
     fog, painting it all a dull and awful red.
    </p>
    <p>
     Red! Suddenly words came into Gabriel's mind--the words of his own poem:
    </p>
    <p>
     ... Red as blood, red as blood! The blood of the shattered miner,
    </p>
    <p>
     Blood of the boy in the rifle pits, blood of the coughing child-slave,
    </p>
    <p>
     Blood of the mangled trainman, blood that the Carpenter shed!
    </p>
    <p>
     "For your sake! For the world's sake, this!" he cried, and hurled
    </p>
    <p>
     another thanatos. "If ever war of liberation was holy, this is that
    </p>
    <p>
     war!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, through all the turmoil of shattering explosions, tossing
    </p>
    <p>
     air-currents and drifting, acrid smoke, he became conscious of a sudden,
    </p>
    <p>
     swift-flying pursuer.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the light of the burning Plant, down there somewhere in the vapors of
    </p>
    <p>
     the thunderous Falls, he saw a hawk-like 'plane that swooped toward him
    </p>
    <p>
     with incredible velocity, savage and lean and black.
    </p>
    <p>
     Off to the right, a sudden spattering of shots in mid-air told him the
    </p>
    <p>
     battle in the sky was likewise being engaged. He saw vague, veiled
    </p>
    <p>
     explosions, there, then a swift, falling trail of flame. A pang shot
    </p>
    <p>
     through his heart. Had one of his companions fallen and been dashed to
    </p>
    <p>
     death? He could not tell--he had no time to wonder, even, for already
    </p>
    <p>
     the attacker was upon him, the swift Air Trust _Ã©pervier,_ one of the
    </p>
    <p>
     dreaded air-fleet of the world-monopoly!
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel had just time to swerve from the attack, and swoop
    </p>
    <p>
     aloft--dropping his next to last projectile as he did so--when the
    </p>
    <p>
     whirling shape zoomed past, swung round and once more charged. He saw,
    </p>
    <p>
     vaguely, two men sat in it. One was the pilot, a "Gray" or Cosmos
    </p>
    <p>
     mercenary. The other--could it be? Yes, there was no mistaking! The
    </p>
    <p>
     other was Slade himself, commander of the hireling army of Plutocracy!
    </p>
    <p>
     Out from the attacking 'plane jetted sadden spurts of fire. Gabriel
    </p>
    <p>
     heard the zip-zip-zip of bullets; heard a ripping tear, as one of his
    </p>
    <p>
     canvas wings was punctured--God help him, had that explosive bullet
    </p>
    <p>
     struck a wire or a stay!
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, maddened to despair; and burning with fierce rage against this
    </p>
    <p>
     monster of the upper air that now was hurling death at him, he once more
    </p>
    <p>
     "banked," brought his machine sharp round, and charged, full drive, at
    </p>
    <p>
     the attacker!
    </p>
    <p>
     This tactic for a second must have disconcerted the Air Trust
    </p>
    <p>
     mercenaries. Gabriel's speed was terrific. With stupefying suddenness,
    </p>
    <p>
     the _Ã©pervier_ loomed up ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now!" he shouted. "Take this, from me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Half rising from his seat, he hurled his last remaining projectile full
    </p>
    <p>
     at Slade, then wrenched his own 'plane off sharply to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
     A thunderous concussion and a dazzling burst of light told him his
    </p>
    <p>
     chance shot had been effective.
    </p>
    <p>
     He got a second's vision of a shattered black mass, a tangle of girders,
    </p>
    <p>
     wires, collapsed planes, that seemed to hang a moment in midair--of
    </p>
    <p>
     whirling bodies--of wreckage indescribable. Then the broken debris
    </p>
    <p>
     plunged with awful speed and vanished through the red-glowing mist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as he shuddered, sickened at the terrible, though necessary deed,
    </p>
    <p>
     the deed which alone could save him from swift death, an overwhelming
    </p>
    <p>
     air-wave from the terrible explosion struck his speeding machine, the
    </p>
    <p>
     machine captured in the Great Smokies from the Air Trust itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     It heeled over like an unballasted yacht under the lash of a hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vainly Gabriel jerked at wheel and levers; he could not right it.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it seemed to come under control, a stay snapped. The 'plane swooped,
    </p>
    <p>
     yawned forward and stuck its nose into an air-hole, caused by the vast,
    </p>
    <p>
     uprising smoke and heat of the huge conflagration beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, lost and beyond all guidance, it somersaulted, slid away down a
    </p>
    <p>
     long drop and, whirling wildly over and over, plunged with Gabriel into
    </p>
    <p>
     the glowing, smoking, detonating void!

    <p>
     TERROR AND RETREAT.
    </p>
    <p>
     When, despite Flint's imperative orders, Slade failed to reopen the
    </p>
    <p>
     lines of communication for him, before nightfall, and when President
    </p>
    <p>
     Supple wired in code for a little more time in obeying Air Trust orders,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Billionaire recognized that something of terrible menace now had
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly broken in upon his dream of universal power.
    </p>
    <p>
     He summoned Waldron and Herzog for another conference and together they
    </p>
    <p>
     feverishly planned to put the works under defense, until such time as
    </p>
    <p>
     troops could be got through to them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The plant regiment was mustered and the Cosmos mercenaries and scabs
    </p>
    <p>
     were made ready. The machine-guns were unlimbered for action and large
    </p>
    <p>
     quantities of ammunition were delivered to them and to the aerial-bomb
    </p>
    <p>
     guns, as nightfall lowered. Herzog set eight hundred men to work
    </p>
    <p>
     covering all the tanks possible, with wire netting of heavy steel. The
    </p>
    <p>
     search-lights were all ordered into use; steam and electrical
    </p>
    <p>
     connections were made, the air-fleet was manned, and everything was done
    </p>
    <p>
     that unlimited wealth and bitter hate of the Workers could suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
     With curses on the fog, which hid the upper air from view, the old man
    </p>
    <p>
     now stood at one of the west windows of his inner office--the office on
    </p>
    <p>
     the top floor of the main Administration Building, overlooking nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole Plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Damn the weather!" he snarled, his gold teeth glinting. "In addition to
    </p>
    <p>
     all this mist from the Falls, there's a regular cloud-bank settling
    </p>
    <p>
     down, tonight! Under cover of it, what may not happen? Nothing could
    </p>
    <p>
     have been worse, Waldron. Though we shall soon control the air, that
    </p>
    <p>
     won't be enough, so long as fogs and mists escape us. Our next
    </p>
    <p>
     problem--hello! Now what the devil's _that_?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's what?" retorted Waldron, testily. He had been drinking rather
    </p>
    <p>
     more heavily than usual, that day, both because of the dull weather and
    </p>
    <p>
     because the Falls invariably got on his nerves, during his brief
    </p>
    <p>
     sojourns there. Away from New York and his favorite haunts, Waldron was
    </p>
    <p>
     lost. "What's what?" he repeated with an ugly look. "This roaring,
    </p>
    <p>
     glaring, trembling place gives me--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "That! That light in the sky!" cried Flint, excitedly pointing. "See?
    </p>
    <p>
     No--it's gone now! But it looked like--like a rocket! A signal, of some
    </p>
    <p>
     kind, thrown from an aeroplane! A--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron laughed harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Seeing things, eh?" he sneered, coming across to the window, himself,
    </p>
    <p>
     and peering out. "_I_ don't see anything! Nothing here to worry about,
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint. With all these walls and guns, and netting, and air-ships and a
    </p>
    <p>
     private army and all, what more do you want? Not getting nervous in your
    </p>
    <p>
     old age, are you, eh?" he gibed bitterly. "Or is your conscience
    </p>
    <p>
     beginning to wake up, as the graveyard becomes more a probability
    </p>
    <p>
     than--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Enough!" Flint snapped at him. "When you drink, Waldron, you're an
    </p>
    <p>
     idiot! Now, forget all this, and let's get down to work. I tell you, I
    </p>
    <p>
     just now saw a signal-light up there in the mist. There's trouble coming
    </p>
    <p>
     tonight, as sure as we own the earth. Trouble, maybe big trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Merciful God, I--I rather think we oughtn't to be here, in person, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
     We'd be much better off out of here. If there--there should be any
    </p>
    <p>
     fighting, you know--"
    </p>
    <p>
     His voice broke in a falsetto pipe. Waldron laughed brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bravo!" cried he, with flushed and mottled face. "You'll do, Flint! I
    </p>
    <p>
     see, right now, the firing-line is the life for you! Well, let the row
    </p>
    <p>
     come, and devil take it, say I. Better anything than--"
    </p>
    <p>
     The sentence was never finished, For suddenly a shattering explosion
    </p>
    <p>
     hurled a vast section of the western encircling wall outward, out into
    </p>
    <p>
     the River, and, where but a moment before, the partners had been gazing
    </p>
    <p>
     at a high concrete-and-steel barrier, with electric lights on top, now
    </p>
    <p>
     only a huge gap appeared, through which the foam-tossed current could be
    </p>
    <p>
     seen leaping swiftly onward toward the Falls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hurled back from the window by the force of the explosion, both men were
    </p>
    <p>
     struck dumb with terror and amaze. Flint rallied first, and with a cry
    </p>
    <p>
     of rage, inarticulate as a beast's howl, sprang to the window again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside, a scene of desolation and wild activity was visible. The great,
    </p>
    <p>
     paved courtyard, flanked by the turbine houses and the wall, on one
    </p>
    <p>
     hand, and on the other by the oxygen tanks' huge bulk that loomed
    </p>
    <p>
     vaguely through the electric-lighted mist, now had begun to swarm with
    </p>
    <p>
     men.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint saw a few forms lying prone under the hard glare of the arcs and
    </p>
    <p>
     vacuum lights. Others were crawling, writhing, making strange
    </p>
    <p>
     contortions. Here, there, men with rifles were running to take their
    </p>
    <p>
     posts. Hoarse orders were shouted, and shrill replies rang back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, all at once, a kind of sputtering series of small explosions began
    </p>
    <p>
     to rip along the edge of the south wall. And now, machine-guns began to
    </p>
    <p>
     talk, with a dry, hard metallic clatter. And--though whence these came,
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint could not see--grenades began flying over the wall and bursting in
    </p>
    <p>
     the court. Though unwounded, men fell everywhere these gas-projectiles
    </p>
    <p>
     exploded--fell, stone dead and stiffening at once--fell, in strange,
    </p>
    <p>
     monstrous, awful attitudes of death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Steam began billowing up; and crackling electrical discharges leaped
    </p>
    <p>
     along the naked wires of the outer barricades.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole Plant shook and rattled with the violent concussions of the
    </p>
    <p>
     aerial-bomb guns, already searching the upper air with shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somewhere, out of the range of vision, another terrible shock made the
    </p>
    <p>
     building tremble to its nethermost foundation; and wild yells and cries,
    </p>
    <p>
     as of a charge, a repulse, a savage and determined rush, echoed through
    </p>
    <p>
     the vast enclosure. Came a third detonation--and, blinding in its
    </p>
    <p>
     intensity, a globe of fire burst almost beneath the window, five stories
    </p>
    <p>
     below.
    </p>
    <p>
     The partners, shaking and pale, retreated hastily. A swift,
    </p>
    <p>
     upward-rising shape swept over the courtyard and was gone--one of the
    </p>
    <p>
     air-fleet now launched to meet the attackers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far below a sudden crumbling shudder of masonry told the Billionaire
    </p>
    <p>
     not a moment was to be lost, for already one wing of the Administration
    </p>
    <p>
     Building was swaying to its fall.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quick, Waldron! Quick!" he shouted, in the shrill treble of senility,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ran into the corridor that led to the north wing. Waldron, suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     sobered, followed; and from the offices, where the night-shift of clerks
    </p>
    <p>
     were laboring (or had been, till the first explosion), came crowding
    </p>
    <p>
     pale and frightened men. Not the fighting cast of Air Trust slaves,
    </p>
    <p>
     these, but the anaemic chemists and experimenters and clerical workers,
    </p>
    <p>
     scabs, to a man. Now, in the common sentiment of fear, they jostled
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint and Waldron, as though these plutocrats had been but common clay.
    </p>
    <p>
     And in the corridor a babel rose, through which fresh volleys and ever
    </p>
    <p>
     more and more violent explosions ripped and thundered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint struck savagely at some who barred his way; and Waldron elbowed
    </p>
    <p>
     through, with curses.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get out of the way, you swine!" shrilled the old Billionaire. "Make
    </p>
    <p>
     way, there! Way!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The two men reached a door that led by a private passage, through to the
    </p>
    <p>
     steel-and-concrete laboratories.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here, this way, Flint!" shouted Waldron. "If those Hell-devils drop a
    </p>
    <p>
     bomb on us, this building will cave in like jackstraws! Our only safety
    </p>
    <p>
     is here, _here_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Thoroughly cowed now, with all the brutal bluster and half-drunken
    </p>
    <p>
     swagger gone, Waldron whipped out a bunch of keys, tremblingly unlocked
    </p>
    <p>
     the door and blundered through. Flint followed. Behind them, others
    </p>
    <p>
     tried to press, on toward the armored laboratories; but with vile
    </p>
    <p>
     blasphemies the plutocrats beat them back and slammed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To Hell with _them_!" shouted Flint, perfectly ashen now and shaking
    </p>
    <p>
     like a leaf, the fear of death strong on his withered soul. "We've got
    </p>
    <p>
     all we can do to look after ourselves! Quick, Waldron, quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Both men, sick with panic, with fear of the unknown terror from above,
    </p>
    <p>
     stumbled rather than ran along the passage, and presently reached the
    </p>
    <p>
     laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here Waldron unlocked another door, this time a steel one, and--as they
    </p>
    <p>
     both crowded through--pressed a hand to his dizzy head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Safe!" he gulped, slamming the door again. "They can't get us _here_,
    </p>
    <p>
     at any rate, no matter what happens! This place is like a fort, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
     His speech was interrupted by a dazing, deafening tumult of sound. The
    </p>
    <p>
     earth trembled, and the laboratory, steel though it was, with concrete
    </p>
    <p>
     facing, rocked on its foundation. A glare through the windows, quickly
    </p>
    <p>
     fading, told them the building they had just quitted was now but a
    </p>
    <p>
     smoking pile of ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint gasped, unable to speak. Waldron, shaking and cowed, tried to
    </p>
    <p>
     moisten his dry lips with a thick tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We--we weren't any too soon!" he gulped, without one thought of the
    </p>
    <p>
     doomed scabs in the Administration Building. Stern justice was now
    </p>
    <p>
     overtaking these wretches. False to the working-class, and eager to
    </p>
    <p>
     serve the Air Trust--not only eager to serve, but zealous in any attack
    </p>
    <p>
     on the proletariat, and by their very employment serving to rivet the
    </p>
    <p>
     shackles on the world--now they were abandoned by their masters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Between upper and nether millstone, moving with neither, they were
    </p>
    <p>
     caught and crushed. And as the great building quivered, gaped wide
    </p>
    <p>
     open, swayed and came thundering down in a vast pile of flame-lit ruin,
    </p>
    <p>
     whence a volcanic burst of fire, smoke and dust arose, they perished
    </p>
    <p>
     miserably, time-servers, cowards and self-seekers to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Flint and Waldron still survived. Though the very earth shook and
    </p>
    <p>
     trembled with the roar of bombs, the crumbling of massive walls, the
    </p>
    <p>
     rattle of volley-fire and the crashing of the terrible grenades that
    </p>
    <p>
     mowed down hundreds as they spread their poisonous gas abroad--though
    </p>
    <p>
     the shriek of projectiles, the thunder of the air-ship guns now sweeping
    </p>
    <p>
     the sky in blind endeavor to shatter the attackers all swelled the
    </p>
    <p>
     tumult to a frightful storm of terror and of death; they still lived,
    </p>
    <p>
     cowered and cringed there in the bomb-proof steel-and-concrete of the
    </p>
    <p>
     inner laboratories.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come, come!" Flint quavered, peering about him at the deserted room,
    </p>
    <p>
     still glaring with electric light--the room now abandoned by all its
    </p>
    <p>
     workers, who, members of Herzog's regiment, had run to take their posts
    </p>
    <p>
     at the first signal of attack. "Come--this isn't safe enough, even here.
    </p>
    <p>
     In--in there!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He pointed toward a vault-like door, leading to the subterranean steel
    </p>
    <p>
     chambers where Herzog eventually counted on storing some hundreds of
    </p>
    <p>
     thousands of tons of liquid oxygen--the reserve-chambers, impregnable to
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning, fire, frost or storm, to man's attacks or nature's--the
    </p>
    <p>
     chambers blasted from the living rock, deep as the Falls themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     vacuum-lined, wondrous achievement of the highest engineering skill the
    </p>
    <p>
     world could boast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There! There!" repeated Flint, plucking at the dazed Waldron's sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tool-steel and concrete, twenty-five feet thick--and vacuum chambers
    </p>
    <p>
     all about--_there_ we can hide! There's safety! Come, come quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Staring, white-faced (he who had been so red!) and dumb, Waldron
    </p>
    <p>
     yielded. Together, furtive as the criminals they were, these two
    </p>
    <p>
     world-masters slunk toward the steel door, while without, their empire
    </p>
    <p>
     was crashing down in smoke, and flame, and blood!
    </p>
    <p>
     They had almost reached it when a smash of glass at the far end of the
    </p>
    <p>
     laboratory whipped them round, in keener terror.
    </p>
    <p>
     Staring, wild-eyed, they beheld the crouching figure of Herzog. Running,
    </p>
    <p>
     even as he cringed, he had upset a glass retort, which had shattered on
    </p>
    <p>
     the concrete floor. And as he ran, he screamed:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_They're in! They're coming! Quick--the steel vaults! Let me in, there!
    </p>
    <p>
     Let me in!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     The coward was now a maniac with terror, his face perfectly white,
    </p>
    <p>
     writhen with panic, and with staring eyes that gleamed horribly under
    </p>
    <p>
     the greenish vacuum-lights.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Back, you! Get out!" roared Waldron, raising a fist. "We--"
    </p>
    <p>
     A sudden belch of flame, outside, split the night with terrible
    </p>
    <p>
     virescence. The whole steel building trembled and swayed. Some of its
    </p>
    <p>
     girders buckled; and the east wall, nearest the oxygen-tanks, caved
    </p>
    <p>
     inward as a mass of many tons was hurled against it.
    </p>
    <p>
     A stunning concussion flung all three men to the floor; and, as they
    </p>
    <p>
     fell, a withering heat-wave quivered through the place.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The oxygen-tanks!" gasped Flint. "They're blown up--they're
    </p>
    <p>
     burning--God help us!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Scorching, yet still eager to live, he crawled on hands and knees toward
    </p>
    <p>
     the steel door. Waldron dragged himself along, half-dead with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, dripping gouts of inextinguishable fire were raining on the roof of
    </p>
    <p>
     the building. A whirlwind of flame was sweeping all its eastern side;
    </p>
    <p>
     and a glare like that of Hell itself seared the eyes of the fugitives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quivering, trembling, slavering, the old man and Waldron wrenched the
    </p>
    <p>
     steel door open.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Me! Me! Let me in! Me! Save me!_" howled Herzog, dragging himself
    </p>
    <p>
     toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They only laughed derisively, with howls of demoniacal scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You slave! You cur!" shouted Waldron, and spat at him as he drew the
    </p>
    <p>
     vault door shut. "You cringing dog--stay there, now, and face it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The great door boomed shut. In the cool of the winding stairway of steel
    </p>
    <p>
     which led, lighted by electricity, to the trap-door and the ladder down
    </p>
    <p>
     into the tremendous vaults, the world-masters breathed deeply once more,
    </p>
    <p>
     respited from death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog, screaming like a fiend in torment, clawed at the impenetrable
    </p>
    <p>
     steel door, raved, begged, entreated, and tore his fingers on the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
     No answer, save the muffled echo of a jeer, from within.
    </p>
    <p>
     _Boom!_
    </p>
    <p>
     What was that?
    </p>
    <p>
     Mad with terror though he was, he whirled about, and faced the room now
    </p>
    <p>
     quivering with heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as he looked, a great gap yawned in the western wall, farthest from
    </p>
    <p>
     the flame-belching oxygen-tank that had been struck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through this gap, pouring irresistibly as the sea, swept a tide of
    </p>
    <p>
     attackers, storming the inner citadel of the infernal, world-strangling
    </p>
    <p>
     Air Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the head of this victorious army, this flood triumphant of the
    </p>
    <p>
     embattled proletaire, Herzog's staring eyes caught a moment's glimpse of
    </p>
    <p>
     a dreaded face--the face of Gabriel Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gasping, the coward and tool of the world-masters made one supreme
    </p>
    <p>
     decision. Close by, a rack of vials stood. He whirled to it, snatched
    </p>
    <p>
     out a tiny bottle and waiting not even to draw the cork--craunched the
    </p>
    <p>
     bottle, glass and all, in his fang-like, uneven teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     An instant change swept over him. His staring eyes closed, his head fell
    </p>
    <p>
     forward, his whole body collapsed like an empty sack. He fell, twitched
    </p>
    <p>
     once or twice, and was dead--dead ere the attackers could reach the door
    </p>
    <p>
     of steel where his bestial masters had betrayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus perished Herzog, coward and tool, a victim of the very forces he
    </p>
    <p>
     himself had helped create.
    </p>
    <p>
     And at the moment of his death, the masters he had cringed to and had
    </p>
    <p>
     served, sneering with scorn at him even in their mortal terror, were
    </p>
    <p>
     tremblingly descending the long metal ladder to the impregnable vaults
    </p>
    <p>
     of steel below.

    <p>
     THE STORMING OF THE WORKS.
    </p>
    <p>
     Plunged into the abyss of mist and flame by the attack of the Air Trust
    </p>
    <p>
     _Ã©pervier_, Gabriel had abandoned himself for lost. Death, mercifully
    </p>
    <p>
     swift, he had felt could be his only fate; and with this thought had
    </p>
    <p>
     come no fear, but only a wild joy that he had shared this glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     battle, sure to end in victory! This was his only thought--this, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     quick vision of Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as he hurtled down and over, whirling drunkenly in the void, all
    </p>
    <p>
     clear perception left him. Everything became a swift blur, a rushing
    </p>
    <p>
     confusion of terrible wind, and lurid light, and the wild roar of myriad
    </p>
    <p>
     explosions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Came a shock, a sudden checking of the plunge, a long and rapid glide,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the DeVreeland stabilizer of the machine, asserting its automatic
    </p>
    <p>
     action, brought it to a level keel once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now the engine was stopped. Gabriel, realizing that some chance
    </p>
    <p>
     still existed to save his life, wrenched madly at his levers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If I can volplane down!" he panted, sick and dizzy, "there may yet be
    </p>
    <p>
     hope!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hope! Yes, but how tenuous! What chance had he, coasting to earth at
    </p>
    <p>
     that low level, to avoid the detonating bombs, the aerial shrapnel being
    </p>
    <p>
     hurled aloft, the poisonous gas, the surface-fire?
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, there and yonder, terrific explosions were shattering the echoes,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the Air Trust batteries swept the fog with their aeroplane-destroying
    </p>
    <p>
     missiles. Whither should he steer? He knew not. All sense of direction
    </p>
    <p>
     was lost, nor could the compass tell him anything. A glance at the
    </p>
    <p>
     barometric gauge showed him an altitude of but 850 feet, and this was
    </p>
    <p>
     decreasing with terrible rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strive as he might, he could not check the swift descent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God send me a soft place to fall on!" he thought, grimly, still
    </p>
    <p>
     clinging to his machine and laboring to jockey it under control.
    </p>
    <p>
     Close by, a thunderous detonation crashed through the mist. His machine
    </p>
    <p>
     reeled and swerved, then plunged more swiftly still. All became vague,
    </p>
    <p>
     to Gabriel--a dream--a nightmare!
    </p>
    <p>
     _Crash!_
    </p>
    <p>
     Flung from the seat, he sprawled through treetops, caught himself, fell
    </p>
    <p>
     to a lower limb, slid off and landed among thick bushes; and through
    </p>
    <p>
     these came to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wrecked 'plane, whirling away and down, fell crashing into the river
    </p>
    <p>
     that rushed cascading by, and vanished in the firelit mist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stunned, yet half-conscious, Gabriel presently sat up and pressed his
    </p>
    <p>
     right hand to his head. His left arm felt numb and useless; and when he
    </p>
    <p>
     tried to raise it, he found it refused his will.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where am I, now, I'd like to know?" he muttered. "Not dead, anyhow--not
    </p>
    <p>
     _yet_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     A continuous roar of explosions shuddered the air, mingled with the
    </p>
    <p>
     booming of the mighty Falls. Shouts and cheers and the rattle of
    </p>
    <p>
     machine-guns assailed his ear. The glare of the search-lights, through
    </p>
    <p>
     the mist and steam, was darkened momentarily by thick, greasy coils of
    </p>
    <p>
     smoke, shot through by violent flashes of light as explosions took
    </p>
    <p>
     place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel struggled to his feet, and peered about him,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Still alive!" said he. "And I must get back into the fight! That's all
    </p>
    <p>
     that matters, now--the fight!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He knew not, yet, where he was; but this mattered nothing. His machine
    </p>
    <p>
     had, in fact, fallen near the river bank, in the eastern section of
    </p>
    <p>
     Prospect Park, beyond the Goat Island bridge--this region of the Park
    </p>
    <p>
     having been left outside the fortifications, in the extension of the Air
    </p>
    <p>
     Trust plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     The trees, here, had saved his life. Had he smashed to earth a hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     yards further north, he would have been shattered against high walls and
    </p>
    <p>
     roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still giddy, but sensing no pain from his injured left arm, Gabriel made
    </p>
    <p>
     way toward the scene of conflict. He knew nothing of how the tide of
    </p>
    <p>
     battle was going; nothing of his position; nothing as to what men he
    </p>
    <p>
     would first meet, his comrades or the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
     But for these considerations he had no thought. His only idea, fixed and
    </p>
    <p>
     grim, was "The fight!" Dazed though he still was, he nerved himself for
    </p>
    <p>
     action.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, pressing onward through the livid glare, through the night
    </p>
    <p>
     shattered by stupendous detonations, he drew his revolver and broke into
    </p>
    <p>
     a run.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strange evidences of the battle now became evident. He saw an unexploded
    </p>
    <p>
     grenade lying beside a wounded man who grasped at him and moaned with
    </p>
    <p>
     pain. Over a wrecked motor-car, greasy smoke was rising, as it burned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Louder shouting drew him down a path to the left. Masses of moving
    </p>
    <p>
     figures became dimly visible, through the mist. And now, stabs of fire
    </p>
    <p>
     pierced the confusion and clamorous night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel jerked up his revolver, as he ran, the terrible weapon shooting
    </p>
    <p>
     bullets charged with hydrocyanic-acid gas.
    </p>
    <p>
     A man rose before him, shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel levelled the weapon; but a glimpse of red ribbon in the other's
    </p>
    <p>
     coat brought it down again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Comrade!" cried he. "Where's the attack?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The other pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gabriel! Is that you?" he gasped, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes! I fell--machine smashed--come on!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! Arm, maybe. No matter! God! What's this?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Toward them a sudden swirl of men came sweeping, stumbling, shouting, in
    </p>
    <p>
     pandemonium.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Our men!" cried Gabriel, starting forward again. "We're being driven!
    </p>
    <p>
     Rally, here! Rally!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Beyond, a louder crackling sounded. Here, there, men plunged down. The
    </p>
    <p>
     retreat was becoming a rout!
    </p>
    <p>
     Yelling, Gabriel flung himself upon the men.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Back there!" he vociferated. "Back, and at the walls! Come on, boys,
    </p>
    <p>
     now! Come on!"
    </p>
    <p>
     His voice, well known to nearly all, thrilled them again with new
    </p>
    <p>
     determination. A shout rose up; it swelled, deepened, roared to majestic
    </p>
    <p>
     volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the tide turned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back went the fighting men of the great Revolution. back at the
    </p>
    <p>
     machine-guns, mounted in the breached walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel was caught and whirled along in that living tide. He found
    </p>
    <p>
     himself at its crest, its foremost wave. Behind him, a roaring, rushing
    </p>
    <p>
     river of men. Before the Inner Citadel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gathering speed and weight as it rolled up, the wave broke like an ocean
    </p>
    <p>
     surge over a crumbling dyke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Down went the Air Trust gunners and the guns, down, down to
    </p>
    <p>
     annihilation!
    </p>
    <p>
     Through the breach, foaming and swelling with irresistible power burst
    </p>
    <p>
     the tides of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silenced now were the Trust guns. The steam-jets had none to man them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far aloft, a last explosion told the death story of the final
    </p>
    <p>
     _Ã©pervier_.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here and there, from windows and corners of the wrecked and blazing
    </p>
    <p>
     plant, a little intermittent firing still continued; but now the hearts
    </p>
    <p>
     of these Air Trust defenders--scabs, thugs and scourings of the
    </p>
    <p>
     slum--had turned to water, in face of the triumphant army of the working
    </p>
    <p>
     class.
    </p>
    <p>
     They fled, those mercenaries, and all the ways and inner
    </p>
    <p>
     strongholds--such as still were left--now lay open to Gabriel and his
    </p>
    <p>
     comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lighted by the blazing buildings and the vast fire torch of an
    </p>
    <p>
     oxygen-tank off to eastward, they stormed the final citadel, the steel
    </p>
    <p>
     and concrete laboratories, heart and soul and center of the hellish
    </p>
    <p>
     world-conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stormed it, as it began to blaze and crumble; stormed it, in search of
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint and Waldron, would-be murderers of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stormed it, only to see Herzog gnash his teeth upon the flask, and
    </p>
    <p>
     fall, and die; only to know that there, within the rock-hewn,
    </p>
    <p>
     steel-lined tanks, below, their enemies had still outwitted them!
    </p>
    <p>
     The swift onrush of the fire drove the victors back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Out, comrades! Out of here_!" shouted Gabriel, facing the attackers.
    </p>
    <p>
     None too soon. Hardly had they beaten a retreat, back into the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     courtyard again, strewn with the dead, when a second oxygen tank
    </p>
    <p>
     exploded, overwhelming the laboratory building with tons of flying
    </p>
    <p>
     steel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leaping toward the zenith, a giant tongue of flame roared heavenward. So
    </p>
    <p>
     intense the heat had now become, that the solid brick and concrete
    </p>
    <p>
     walls, exposed to the direct verberation of the flame, began to crack
    </p>
    <p>
     and crumble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gabriel ordered a general retreat of the attacking army. Victory was
    </p>
    <p>
     won; and to stay near that gushing tornado of flame, with new explosions
    </p>
    <p>
     bound to occur as the other oxygen tanks let go, must mean annihilation.
    </p>
    <p>
     So the triumphant Army of the Proletaire fell back and back still
    </p>
    <p>
     further, out into the wrecked and trampled Park, and all through the
    </p>
    <p>
     city, where shattered buildings, many of them ablaze, and broken trees,
    </p>
    <p>
     dead bodies, smashed ordnance and chaos absolute told something of the
    </p>
    <p>
     story of that brief but terrible war.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ringed round the perishing ruins of the Air Trust they stood, these
    </p>
    <p>
     mute, thrilled thousands. Silence fell, now, as they watched the
    </p>
    <p>
     roaring, ever-mounting flames that, whipped by the breeze, crashed
    </p>
    <p>
     upward in long and cadenced tourbillions of white, of awful
    </p>
    <p>
     incandescence.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the river, ever-hurrying, always foaming on and downward to its
    </p>
    <p>
     titanic plunge, sparkled with eerie lights in that vast glow. Its voice
    </p>
    <p>
     of thunder seemed to chant the passing and the requiem of the Curse of
    </p>
    <p>
     the World, Capitalism.

    <p>
     DEATH IN THE PIT OF STEEL.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Flint, now, what of him! And Waldron?
    </p>
    <p>
     While the Air Trust plant was burning, crumbling, smashing down, what of
    </p>
    <p>
     its masters, the masters of the world?
    </p>
    <p>
     A sense of vast relief possessed them both, at first, as the steel door
    </p>
    <p>
     clanged after them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, for a time at least, they realized that they were safe, safe from
    </p>
    <p>
     the People, safe from the awakened and triumphant Proletariat. Even now,
    </p>
    <p>
     had they surrendered, they would have been spared; but nothing was
    </p>
    <p>
     further from their thoughts than any treating with the despised and
    </p>
    <p>
     hated enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Foremost in the mind of each, now, was the thought that if they could
    </p>
    <p>
     but stand siege, a day or so, the troops of the government--their
    </p>
    <p>
     government and their troops, their own personal property--would
    </p>
    <p>
     inevitably rescue them.
    </p>
    <p>
     With this comforting belief, together they descended the long steel
    </p>
    <p>
     staircase to the trap-door, passed through this, and climbed down the
    </p>
    <p>
     metal ladder to the vast storage-vaults.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here, everything was cool and quiet and well-lighted. Not yet had the
    </p>
    <p>
     electric-generating plant been put out of action. Though all its workers
    </p>
    <p>
     had either been drafted into the ranks of the Cosmos mercenaries, or
    </p>
    <p>
     Herzog's regiments, or else had fled to hiding, still the huge turbines
    </p>
    <p>
     and enormous dynamos were whirling, unattended. Thus, for the first few
    </p>
    <p>
     minutes, in their living tomb, down over which the ruins of the now
    </p>
    <p>
     white-hot laboratory-building had crashed, the world-masters had
    </p>
    <p>
     electric light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reassured a little, they descended to the very bottom of the first huge
    </p>
    <p>
     tank.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God!" snarled Flint, as he breathed deeply and glared about him. "The
    </p>
    <p>
     curs! The swine! To think of this, _this_ really happening! And to think
    </p>
    <p>
     that if we hadn't got here just in time, they'd actually have--have used
    </p>
    <p>
     violence on _us_--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron laughed brutally, his body still trembling and his face chalky.
    </p>
    <p>
     His laugh echoed, hollowly, from the metal walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You old fool!" he spat. "Canting old hypocrite to the last, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
     Violence? What the devil do you expect? Rosewater and confetti? Violence
    </p>
    <p>
     was all that ever held 'em, wasn't it? And when they slipped the leash,
    </p>
    <p>
     naturally they retorted--that's all! Violence? You make me sick! Damned
    </p>
    <p>
     lucky for us if we get through this yet, without violence, you whining
    </p>
    <p>
     cur!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint, for the first time hearing Waldron's honest opinion of him,
    </p>
    <p>
     failed even to note it. All his panic-stricken ear had caught was the
    </p>
    <p>
     note of hope, of survival.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clutching eagerly at Waldron's sleeve, he cackled:
    </p>
    <p>
     "If we get through? If we get through, you say? Then, in your opinion,
    </p>
    <p>
     there _is_ a chance to get through? They can't get us here? We surely
    </p>
    <p>
     shall be rescued?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bah!" Waldron flung at him, some latent spark of courage still
    </p>
    <p>
     smouldering in his sodden breast, whereas old Flint was craven to the
    </p>
    <p>
     marrow. "You nauseate me! Afraid to die, eh? Well, so am I; but not so
    </p>
    <p>
     damned paralyzed and sick with panic as all that! If you'd taken less
    </p>
    <p>
     dope, the last twenty years, you'd have more nerve now, to face the
    </p>
    <p>
     music! World-master, you? Eh? Playing the biggest game on earth--and
    </p>
    <p>
     now, when things break bad, you squeal! Arrrh! You called me a quitter
    </p>
    <p>
     once, you mealy-mouthed old Pecksniff! We'll see, now, who quits! We'll
    </p>
    <p>
     see, at a show-down, who can face it, you or I!"
    </p>
    <p>
     [Illustration: His fingers lost their hold--he dropped like a Plummet.]
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron's brutality, the hard, savage quality that all his life had made
    </p>
    <p>
     him "Tiger" Waldron, now was beginning to reassert itself. His first
    </p>
    <p>
     sheer panic over, a little manhood was returning. But as for Flint, no
    </p>
    <p>
     manhood dwelt in him to be awakened. Instead, each moment found him more
    </p>
    <p>
     abject and more pitiable. Like an old woman he now wrung his hands and
    </p>
    <p>
     groaned, hysterically; and now he paced the steel floor of the vault
    </p>
    <p>
     that was destined to be his tomb; and now he stopped again and stared
    </p>
    <p>
     about him with wild eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     On all sides, sheer up a hundred feet or more, the smooth steel sides of
    </p>
    <p>
     the vast oxygen tank rose, studded with long lines of rivets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Near the top a dark aperture showed where the six-inch pipe joined the
    </p>
    <p>
     tank; the pipe destined to fill it, when Herzog's last process--never,
    </p>
    <p>
     now, to be completed--should have been done.
    </p>
    <p>
     The huge floor, 150 feet in diameter, sloped gently downward toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     center; and here yawned another pipe, covered by a grating--the pipe to
    </p>
    <p>
     drain the liquid oxygen out to the pumping station.
    </p>
    <p>
     So deeply set in the rock of the Niagara cliff was this stupendous
    </p>
    <p>
     tank, and so cunningly surrounded by vacuum-chambers, that now no
    </p>
    <p>
     faintest sound of the Falls was audible. All that betrayed the nearness
    </p>
    <p>
     of the cataract was a faint, incessant trembling of the metal walls, as
    </p>
    <p>
     though the solid ribs of Earth herself were shuddering with the impact
    </p>
    <p>
     of the plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Old Flint surveyed this extraordinary chamber with mingled feelings. It
    </p>
    <p>
     surely offered absolute protection, for the present--or seemed to--but
    </p>
    <p>
     his distressed mind conjured alarming pictures of the future, in case no
    </p>
    <p>
     rescue came. Death by starvation, thirst and madness loomed before him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nervously he recommenced his pacing. Another terribly serious factor was
    </p>
    <p>
     to be considered. He had now been three hours without his dose of
    </p>
    <p>
     morphia, and his nerves were calling, tugging insistently for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rotten luck," he grumbled, "that I've got none with me!" Even there, in
    </p>
    <p>
     the imminent presence of disaster and death, his mind reverted to the
    </p>
    <p>
     poison, more necessary to him than food.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron now had grown fairly calm. He stood leaning against the steel
    </p>
    <p>
     ladder, down which they had descended. Choosing a cigar, he proceeded to
    </p>
    <p>
     light up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Might as well be comfortable while we wait," said he. "I only wish we
    </p>
    <p>
     had a couple of chairs, down here. Oversight on our part that we didn't
    </p>
    <p>
     have some steel ones put in, and a line of canned goods and a few quarts
    </p>
    <p>
     of Scotch. The floor's a bit damp and cold to sit on, and I want a drink
    </p>
    <p>
     damn bad!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint swung about and faced him, pale and shaking, tortured with fear
    </p>
    <p>
     and with longing for his dope.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You--you don't think it _will_ be long, eh, do you?" he demanded. "Not
    </p>
    <p>
     long before we're taken out?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron shrugged his shoulders and blew a long, thin arrow of smoke
    </p>
    <p>
     athwart the brightly-lighted air.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Search me!" he exclaimed. "To judge by what was happening when we made
    </p>
    <p>
     our exit, the Plant must be a mess, by this time. We seem to have been
    </p>
    <p>
     checked, even if not mated, Flint. I must admit they caught us by
    </p>
    <p>
     surprise. Caught us napping, damn them, after all! They were stronger
    </p>
    <p>
     than we thought, Flint, and cleverer, and better organized. And so--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't say 'we,' curse you!" snarled Flint. "Blame yourself, if you want
    </p>
    <p>
     to, but leave me out! _I_ knew there was trouble due, I tell you. _I_
    </p>
    <p>
     saw it coming! Who's been trying to crush the swine completely, if not
    </p>
    <p>
     I? Who's worked night and day to have those bills put through, and who
    </p>
    <p>
     had the army increased, and conscription started? Who's driven the
    </p>
    <p>
     President to back all sorts of things? Who's forced them? Who made the
    </p>
    <p>
     National Mounted Police a reality, if not I? Damn you, don't include
    </p>
    <p>
     _me_ in your blame!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron shrugged his shoulders, and smoked contemplatively.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Suit yourself," he answered. "If we both die, down here, it won't
    </p>
    <p>
     matter much either way."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Die?" quavered the old jackal, suddenly forgetting his rage and peering
    </p>
    <p>
     about with furtive eyes. "Did you say die, Wally? No, no! You didn't say
    </p>
    <p>
     that! You didn't mean that, surely!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron smiled, evilly, joying in this abject fear of his hated partner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, yes, I did, though," he retorted. "It's quite possible, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
     In case our government--yours, if you prefer--can't get troops through,
    </p>
    <p>
     here, or a big general revolution sweeps things, inside a day or two,
    </p>
    <p>
     we're done. We'll starve and stifle, here, sure as shooting!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no, no! Not that, not _that_!" whimpered Flint, shuddering. "I
    </p>
    <p>
     can't die, yet. I--I'm not ready for it! There's all that missionary
    </p>
    <p>
     work of mine not yet done, and my huge international Sunday School
    </p>
    <p>
     League to perfect; and there's the tremendous ten-million-dollar
    </p>
    <p>
     Cathedral of Saint Luke the Pious that I'm having built on Riverside
    </p>
    <p>
     Drive, and there's--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cut it!" gibed Waldron, spitting with very disgust. "If your time's
    </p>
    <p>
     come, Flint, you'll die, cathedrals or no cathedrals. Your Sunday
    </p>
    <p>
     schools won't save you any more than my investments will--which have
    </p>
    <p>
     largely been wine, women and song. As a matter of fact, if it comes to
    </p>
    <p>
     starvation, if we aren't rescued and taken out from under the red-hot
    </p>
    <p>
     wreckage that's on top of us, I'll outlive _you_! I can exist on my
    </p>
    <p>
     surplus adipose tissue, for a while; but you--_you're_ nothing but skin
    </p>
    <p>
     and bone. You'll starve far quicker than I will, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't! Don't!" implored the shaking wretch, covering his eyes with both
    </p>
    <p>
     trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Moral, you oughtn't to have been a dope-fiend, all these years,"
    </p>
    <p>
     continued Waldron, cuttingly, determined that now, once for all, his
    </p>
    <p>
     despised partner should hear the truth. "How you've lived so long, as it
    </p>
    <p>
     is, I don't understand. When I tried to marry Kate, and failed, I
    </p>
    <p>
     reckoned you'd pass over in almost no time--and, by the way, that's why
    </p>
    <p>
     I was so insistent. But you've disappointed me, Flint. Disappointed me
    </p>
    <p>
     sorely. You still live. It won't be long, however. Down here, you know,
    </p>
    <p>
     you simply can't get any dope. In a little while you'll begin to suffer
    </p>
    <p>
     the torments of Hell. You'll die of starvation and drug 'yen,' Flint,
    </p>
    <p>
     and you'll die mad, mad, _mad_! Understand me! Mad, for morphine! And I,
    </p>
    <p>
     I shall watch you, and exult!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint cringed, shuddering and stopped his ears. His partner, gloating
    </p>
    <p>
     over him, smoked faster now. A strange light shone in his eyes. His
    </p>
    <p>
     pulse beat faster than usual, and a certain extravagance of thought and
    </p>
    <p>
     speech had become manifest in him.
    </p>
    <p>
     He tried to compose himself, feeling that he must not push the cowardly
    </p>
    <p>
     Flint too far, but his ideas refused to flow in orderly sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wonderingly he stared at his cigar, the tip of which was now glowing
    </p>
    <p>
     more brightly than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, suddenly sniffing the air he understood. His eyes widened with
    </p>
    <p>
     horror absolute. He started forward, gasped and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Flint! Flint! The oxygen is coming in!_"
    </p>
    <p>
     Uncomprehending, the old man still stood there, mumbling to himself. His
    </p>
    <p>
     face was now tinged with unusual color, and his heart, too, was thumping
    </p>
    <p>
     strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Oxygen_!" shouted Waldron, shaking him by the shoulder. "It--it's
    </p>
    <p>
     leaking in, here, somewhere! If we can't stop it--_we're dead men_!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eh? _What_?" stammered the Billionaire, staring at him with eyes of
    </p>
    <p>
     half-intoxicated fear. "What d'you mean, the oxygen? In--in here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "_In here_!" cried "Tiger," casting a wild and terrible gaze about him
    </p>
    <p>
     at the vast, empty trap of steel. "Can't you smell it? That ozone
    </p>
    <p>
     smell? My God, we're lost! We're lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're crazy!" retorted Flint, with vigor. "Nothing of the sort could
    </p>
    <p>
     happen!" His head was held high, now, and new life seemed surging
    </p>
    <p>
     through that spent and drug-wrecked body. "There's no way those curs
    </p>
    <p>
     could have turned on any gas, here. You're crazy, ha! ha! ha! Insane,
    </p>
    <p>
     eh? A good joke--capital joke, that! I must tell it at the Union League
    </p>
    <p>
     Club! 'Tiger' Waldron, suddenly insane, and--ha! ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He burst into a long, shrill cacchination. Already his face was scarlet
    </p>
    <p>
     and his mind a whirl. Though neither man understood the reason, yet the
    </p>
    <p>
     fact remained that one of the last great explosions had ruptured a
    </p>
    <p>
     subterranean check-valve closing the six-inch pipe that was to feed the
    </p>
    <p>
     storage-tanks; and now a swift, huge stream of pure oxygen gas was
    </p>
    <p>
     rushing at tremendous velocity into the vast chamber of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, his heart leaping as though it would burst his ribs, raised a
    </p>
    <p>
     fist to strike down his insulter; then, with drunken indecision, joined
    </p>
    <p>
     in the maniacal laughter of the staggering old man.
    </p>
    <p>
     In their ears a strange, wild humming now became audible. Lights danced
    </p>
    <p>
     before their eyes; their senses reeled, and violent, extravagant ideas
    </p>
    <p>
     surged through their drunken brains.
    </p>
    <p>
     "_Ha! Ha! Ha!_" rang Waldron's crazy laughter, echoing the old man's.
    </p>
    <p>
     All at once, his cigar broke into flame. Cursing, he hurled it away,
    </p>
    <p>
     staggering back against the ladder and stood there swaying, clutching it
    </p>
    <p>
     to hold himself from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
     There he stood, and stared at Flint, with eyes that started from his
    </p>
    <p>
     head, with panting breath and crimson face.
    </p>
    <p>
     The old man, in a sudden revulsion of terror, was now grovelling along
    </p>
    <p>
     the floor, by one of the massive walls, clawing at the steel with
    </p>
    <p>
     impotent hands and screaming mingled prayers and oaths. His ravings,
    </p>
    <p>
     horrible to hear, echoed through the great tank, now swiftly filling
    </p>
    <p>
     with gas.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Help! Help!" he screamed. "Save me--my God--save me--. Let me out, let
    </p>
    <p>
     me out! A million, if you let me out! A billion--_the whole world_! The
    </p>
    <p>
     world, ha! ha! ha! Damn it to Hell--the world, I say! I'll give the
    </p>
    <p>
     world to be let out! It's mine--I own it--_all, all mine!_ Ha! Dogs! You
    </p>
    <p>
     would rise up against your master and your God, would you? But it's no
    </p>
    <p>
     use--we'll beat you yet--out! _out_!--the world--I own it! All this
    </p>
    <p>
     plant--this gas, all mine! My oxygen--ah! it chokes me! _Help!
    </p>
    <p>
     Help!_--Swine! I'll scourge you yet--_absolute power_--_the world_--!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With one final spark of energy, panting, his heart flailing itself to
    </p>
    <p>
     death under the pitiless urge of the oxygen, old Flint sprang up, ran
    </p>
    <p>
     wildly, blindly straight across the steel floor, and, screaming
    </p>
    <p>
     blasphemies like a soul in Hell, dashed into the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     He recoiled, staggered, spun round and fell sprawling most
    </p>
    <p>
     horribly--stone dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Waldron, at sight of this awful end, felt an uncontrollable terror sweep
    </p>
    <p>
     over his drunk and maddened senses. Though all his blood was leaping in
    </p>
    <p>
     his arteries, and his breath coming so fast it choked him, yet a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment's seeming sanity possessed his reeling brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The door! The door, up there!" he screamed, with a wild, terrible
    </p>
    <p>
     curse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, turning toward the ladder, in spite of his fat and flabby muscles
    </p>
    <p>
     quivering in terrible spasms, he ran up the long steel structure with a
    </p>
    <p>
     supreme and ape-like agility.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fifty feet he made, seventy-five, ninety--
    </p>
    <p>
     But, all at once, something seemed to break in his overtaxed heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     A blackness swam before his dazzled eyes. His head fell back. Unnerved,
    </p>
    <p>
     his fingers lost their hold. And, whirling over and over in midair, he
    </p>
    <p>
     dropped like a plummet.
    </p>
    <p>
     By one wall lay Flint's body. At the foot of the ladder, like a crushed
    </p>
    <p>
     sack of bones, sprawled the corpse of "Tiger" Waldron.
    </p>
    <p>
     And still the rushing oxygen, with which they two had hoped to dominate
    </p>
    <p>
     the world, poured through the six-inch main, far, far above--senseless
    </p>
    <p>
     matter, blindly avenging itself upon the rash and evil men who impiously
    </p>
    <p>
     had sought to cage and master it!

     CHAPTER XXXVIII.
    </head>
    <p>
     VISIONS.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus perished Flint and Waldron, scourges of the earth. Thus they died,
    </p>
    <p>
     slain by the very force which they had planned would betray mankind and
    </p>
    <p>
     deliver it into their chains. Thus vanished, forever, the most sinister
    </p>
    <p>
     and cruel minds ever evolved upon this planet; the greatest menace the
    </p>
    <p>
     human race had ever known; the evil Masters of the World.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as they died, massed around their perished Air Trust plant, a throng
    </p>
    <p>
     of silent, earnest watchers stood, with faces illumined by the symbolic,
    </p>
    <p>
     sacrificial flames--a throng of emancipated workers, of toilers from
    </p>
    <p>
     whose bowed shoulders now forever had been lifted the frightful menace
    </p>
    <p>
     of a universal bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Explosion after explosion burst from the tortured Inferno of the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     plant. Buildings came crashing, reeling, thundering down; walls fell,
    </p>
    <p>
     amid vast, belching clouds of dust and smoke; a white, consuming sheet
    </p>
    <p>
     of flame crackled across the sinister and evil place; and in its wake
    </p>
    <p>
     glowed incandescent ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, in one final burst of thunderous tumult, the hugest tank of all,
    </p>
    <p>
     exploding with a roar like that of Doom itself, hurled belching flames
    </p>
    <p>
     on high.
    </p>
    <p>
     For many miles--in Buffalo, Rochester, Toronto and scores of cities on
    </p>
    <p>
     both sides of the Great Lakes--silent multitudes watched the glare
    </p>
    <p>
     against the midnight sky; and many wept for joy; and many prayed. All
    </p>
    <p>
     understood the meaning of that sight. The light upon the heavens seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     a signal and a beacon--a promise that the Old Times had passed away
    </p>
    <p>
     forever--a covenant of the New.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, as the final explosion shattered the Temple of Bondage to wreckage,
    </p>
    <p>
     flung it far into the rushing river and swept it over the leaping,
    </p>
    <p>
     thundering Falls, the news flashed on a thousand wires, to all cities
    </p>
    <p>
     and all lands; and though the mercenaries of the two dead world-masters
    </p>
    <p>
     still might struggle and might strive to beat the toilers back to
    </p>
    <p>
     slavery again, their days were numbered and their powers forever broken.
    </p>
    <p>
     Together in the doorway of the refuge at Port Colborne, Catherine stood
    </p>
    <p>
     with Gabriel, watching the beacon of liberty upon the heavens. The
    </p>
    <p>
     light, a halo round her eager face, showed his powerful figure and the
    </p>
    <p>
     smile of triumph in his eyes. His left arm, broken by the fall in the
    </p>
    <p>
     aeroplane, now rested in a sling. His right, protecting in its strength,
    </p>
    <p>
     was round the girl. And as her head found shelter and rest, at length,
    </p>
    <p>
     upon his shoulder, she, too, smiled; and her eyes seemed to see visions
    </p>
    <p>
     in the glory of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Visions!" said she, softly, as though voicing a universal thought. "Do
    </p>
    <p>
     you behold them, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," he answered, "and they are beautiful and sweet and pure!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Visions that we now shall surely see?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shall surely see!" he echoed; and a little silence fell. Far off, they
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to hear a vast and thousand-throated cheering, that the
    </p>
    <p>
     night-wind brought to them in long and heart-inspiring cadences.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gabriel," she said, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wish _he_ might have seen them, and have understood! In spite of all
    </p>
    <p>
     he did, and was, he was my father!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," answered Gabriel, sensing her grief. "But would you have had him
    </p>
    <p>
     live through this? Live, with the whole world out of his grasp, again?
    </p>
    <p>
     Live, with all his plans wrecked and broken? Live on in this new time,
    </p>
    <p>
     where he could have comprehended nothing? Live on, in misery and rage
    </p>
    <p>
     and impotence?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your father was an old man, Catherine. You know as well as I
    </p>
    <p>
     do--better, perhaps--the whole trend of his life's thought and ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if he'd lived, he couldn't have changed, now, at his age. It would
    </p>
    <p>
     have been an utter impossibility. Why say more?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine made no reply; but in her very attitude of trust and
    </p>
    <p>
     confidence, Gabriel knew he read the comfort he had given her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence, a while. At last she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Visions!" she whispered. "Wonderful visions of the glad, new time! How
    </p>
    <p>
     do you see them, Gabriel?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "How do I see them?" His face seemed to glow with inspiration under the
    </p>
    <p>
     shining light in the far heavens. "I see them as the realization of a
    </p>
    <p>
     time, now really close at hand, when this old world of ours shall be, as
    </p>
    <p>
     it never yet has been, in truth civilized, emancipated, free. When the
    </p>
    <p>
     night of ignorance, kingcraft, priestcraft, servility and prejudice,
    </p>
    <p>
     bigotry and superstition shall be forever swept away by the dawn of
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence and universal education, by scientific truth and light--by
    </p>
    <p>
     understanding and by fearlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When Science shall no longer be 'the mystery of a class,' but shall
    </p>
    <p>
     become the heritage of all mankind. When, because much is known by all,
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing shall be dreaded by any. When all mankind shall be absolutely
    </p>
    <p>
     its own master, strong, and brave, and free!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Like you, Gabriel!" the girl exclaimed, from her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't say that!" he disclaimed. "Don't--"
    </p>
    <p>
     She put her hand over his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shhhh!" she forbade him. "You mustn't argue, now, because your arm's
    </p>
    <p>
     just been set and we don't want any fever. If my dreams include you,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, Gabriel, don't try to tell me I'm mistaken--because I'm not, to
    </p>
    <p>
     begin with, and I _know_ I'm not!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He laughed, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you realize," said he, "that when it comes to bravery, and strength,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the splendid freedom of an emancipated soul, I must look to _you_
    </p>
    <p>
     for light and leading?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't!" she whispered. "Look only to the future--to the newer, better
    </p>
    <p>
     world now coming to birth! The time which is to know no poverty, no
    </p>
    <p>
     crime, no children's blood wrung out for dividends!
    </p>
    <p>
     "The future when no longer Idleness can enslave Labor to its tasks. When
    </p>
    <p>
     every man who will, may labor freely, whether with hand or brain, and
    </p>
    <p>
     receive the full value of his toil, undiminished by any theft or
    </p>
    <p>
     purloining whatsoever!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The future," he continued, as she paused, "when crowns, titles, swords,
    </p>
    <p>
     rifles and dreadnaughts shall be known only by history. When the earth
    </p>
    <p>
     and the fulness thereof shall belong to all Earth's people; and when its
    </p>
    <p>
     soil need be no longer fertilized with human blood, its crops no longer
    </p>
    <p>
     be brought forth watered by sweat and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Such have been my visions and my dreams, Catherine--a few of them. Now
    </p>
    <p>
     they are coming true! And other dreams and other visions--dreams of you
    </p>
    <p>
     and visions of our life together--what of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why need you ask, Gabriel?" she answered, raising her lips to his.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of singing, a triumphal chorus of the accomplished Revolution,
    </p>
    <p>
     a vast and million-throated song, seemed wafted to them on the wings of
    </p>
    <p>
     night.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the pure stars, witnessing their love and troth, looked down upon
    </p>
    <p>
     them from the heavens where shone the fire-glow of the Great
    </p>
    <p>
     Emancipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     THE END.
