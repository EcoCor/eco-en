     THE BIRTH OF AN IDEA.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90">
     Sunk far back in the huge leather cushions of his morris chair, old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_100">
     Isaac Flint was thinking, thinking hard. Between narrowed lids, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_110">
     hard, gray eyes were blinking at the morning sunlight that poured into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_120">
     his private office, high up in the great building he had reared on Wall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_130">
     Street. From his thin lips now and then issued a coil of smoke from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_140">
     costly cigar he was consuming. His bony legs were crossed, and one foot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_150">
     twitched impatiently. Now and again he tugged at his white mustache. A
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_160">
     frown creased his hard brow; and, as he pondered, something of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_170">
     glitter of a snake seemed reflected in his pupils.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_190">
     "Not enough," he muttered, harshly. "It's not enough--there must be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_200">
     more, more, more! Some way must be found. Must be, and shall be!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_220">
     The sunlight of early spring, glad and warm over Manhattan, brought no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_230">
     message of cheer to the Billionaire. It bore no news of peace and joy to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_240">
     him. Its very brightness, as it flooded the metropolis and mellowed his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_250">
     luxurious inner office, seemed to offend the master of the world. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_260">
     presently he arose, walked to the window and made as though to lower
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_270">
     the shade. But for a moment he delayed this action. Standing there at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_280">
     the window, he peered out. Far below him, the restless, swarming life of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_290">
     the huge city crept and grovelled. Insects that were men and women
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_300">
     crowded the clefts that were streets. Long lines of cars, toy-like,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_310">
     crept along the "L" structures. As far as the eye could reach, tufted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_320">
     plumes of smoke and steam wafted away on the April breeze. The East
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_330">
     River glistened in the sunlight, its bosom vexed by myriad craft, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_340">
     ocean liners, by tugs and barges, by grim warships, by sailing-vessels,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_350">
     whose canvas gleamed, by snow-white fruitboats from the tropics, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_360">
     hulls from every port. Over the bridges, long slow lines of traffic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_370">
     crawled. And, far beyond to the dim horizon, stretched out the hives of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_380">
     men, till the blue depths of distance swallowed all in haze.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_400">
     And as Flint gazed on this marvel, all created and maintained by human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_410">
     toil, by sweat and skill and tireless patience of the workers, a hard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_420">
     smile curved his lips.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_440">
     "All mine, more or less," said he to himself, puffing deep on his cigar.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_450">
     "All yielding tribute to me, even as the mines and mills and factories I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_460">
     cannot see yield tribute! Even as the oil-wells, the pipe-lines, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_470">
     railroads and the subways yield--even as the whole world yields it. All
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_480">
     this labor, all this busy strife, I have a hand in. The millions eat and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_490">
     drink and buy and sell; and I take toll of it--yet it is not enough. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_500">
     hold them in my hand, yet the hand cannot close, completely. And until
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_510">
     it does, it is not enough! No, not enough for me!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_530">
     He pondered a moment, standing there musing at the window, surveying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_540">
     "all the wonders of the earth" that in its fulness, in that year of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_550">
     grace, 1921, bore tribute to him who toiled not, neither spun; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_560">
     though he smiled, the smile was bitter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_580">
     "Not enough, yet," he reflected. "And how--how shall I close my grip?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_590">
     How shall I master all this, absolutely and completely, till it be mine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_600">
     in truth? Through light? The mob can do with less, if I squeeze too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_610">
     hard! Through food? They can economize! Transportation? No, the traffic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_620">
     will bear only a certain load! How, then? What is it they all must have,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_630">
     or die, that I can control? What universal need, vital to rich and poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_640">
     alike? To great and small? What absolute necessity which shall make my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_650">
     rivals in the Game as much my vassals as the meanest slave in my steel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_660">
     mills? What can it be? For power I must have! Like Caesar, who preferred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_670">
     to be first in the smallest village, rather than be second at Rome, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_680">
     can and will have no competitor. I must rule _all_, or the game is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_690">
     worthless! But how?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_710">
     Almost as in answer to his mental question, a sudden gust of air swayed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_720">
     the curtain and brushed it against his face. And, on the moment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_730">
     inspiration struck him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_750">
     "What?" he exclaimed suddenly, his brows wrinkling, a strange and eager
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_760">
     light burning in his hard eyes. "Eh, what? Can it--could it be possible?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_770">
     My God! If so--if it might be--the world would be my toy, to play with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_780">
     as I like!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_800">
     "If _that_ could happen, kings and emperors would have to cringe and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_810">
     crawl to me, like my hordes of serfs all over this broad land. Statesmen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_820">
     and diplomats, president and judges, lawmakers and captains of industry,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_830">
     all would fall into bondage; and for the first time in history one man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_840">
     would rule the earth, completely and absolutely--_and that man would be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_850">
     Isaac Flint_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_870">
     Staggered by the very immensity of the bold thought, so vast that for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_880">
     moment he could not realize it in its entirety, the Billionaire fell to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_890">
     pacing the floor of his office.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_910">
     His cigar now hung dead and unnoticed between his thinly cruel lips. His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_920">
     hands were gripped behind his bent back, as he paced the priceless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_930">
     Shiraz rug, itself having cost the wage of a hundred workmen for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_940">
     year's hard, grinding toil. And as he trod, up and down, up and down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_950">
     rich apartments, a slow, grim smile curved his mouth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_970">
     "What editor could withstand me, then?" he was thinking. "What clergyman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_980">
     could raise his voice against my rule? Ah! Their 'high principles' they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_990">
     prate of so eloquently, their crack-brained economics, their rebellions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1000">
     and their strikes--the dogs!--would soon bow down before _that_ power!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1010">
     Men have starved for stiff-necked opposition's sake, and still may do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1020">
     so--but with my hand at the throat of the world, with the world's very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1030">
     life-breath in my grip, what then? Submission, or--ha! well, we shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1040">
     see, we shall see!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1060">
     A subtle change came over his face, which had been growing paler for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1070">
     some minutes. Impatiently he flung away his cigar, and, turning to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1080">
     desk, opened a drawer, took out a little vial and uncorked it. He shook
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1090">
     out two small white tablets, on the big sheet of plate-glass that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1100">
     covered the desk, swallowed them eagerly, and replaced the vial in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1110">
     desk again. For be it known that, master of the world though Flint was,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1120">
     he too had a master--morphine. Long years he had bowed beneath its whip,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1130">
     the veriest slave of the insidious drug. No three hours could pass,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1140">
     without that dosage. His immense native will power still managed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1150">
     control the dose and not increase it; but years ago he had abandoned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1160">
     hope of ever diminishing or ceasing it. And now he thought no more of it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1170">
     than of--well, of breathing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1190">
     Breathing! As he stood up again and drew a deep breath, under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1200">
     reviving influence of the drug, his inspiration once more recurred to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1210">
     him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1230">
     "Breath!" said he. "Breath is life. Without food and drink and shelter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1240">
     men can live a while. Even without water, for some days. But without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1250">
     _air_--they die inevitably and at once. And if I make the air my own,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1260">
     then I am master of all life!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1280">
     And suddenly he burst into a harsh, jangling laugh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1300">
     "Air!" he cried exultantly, "An Air Trust! By God in Heaven, it can be!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1310">
     It shall be!--it must!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1330">
     His mind, somewhat sluggish before he had taken the morphine, now was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1340">
     working clearly and accurately again, with that fateful and undeviating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1350">
     precision which had made him master of billions of dollars and uncounted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1360">
     millions of human lives; which had woven his network of possession all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1370">
     over the United States, Europe and Asia and even Africa; which had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1380">
     drawn, as into a spider's web, the world's railroads and steamship
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1390">
     lines, its coal and copper and steel, its oil and grain and beef, its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1400">
     every need--save air!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1420">
     And now, keen on the track of this last great inspiration, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1430">
     Billionaire strode to his revolving book-case, whirled it round and from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1440">
     its shelves jerked a thick volume, a smaller book and some pamphlets.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1460">
     "Let's have some facts!" said he, flinging them upon his desk, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1470">
     seating himself before it in a costly chair of teak. "Once I get an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1480">
     outline of the facts and what I want to do, then my subordinates can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1490">
     carry out my plans. Before all, I must have facts!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1510">
     For half an hour he thumbed his references, noting all the salient
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1520">
     points mentally, without taking a single note; for, so long as the drug
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1530">
     still acted, his brain was an instrument of unsurpassed keenness and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1540">
     accuracy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1560">
     A sinister figure he made, as he sat there poring intently over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1570">
     technical books before him, contrasting strangely with the beauty and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1580">
     the luxury of the office. On the mantel, over the fireplace of Carrara

     boded no good to the world, the soft spring air that had inspired his

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1700">
     Of a sudden, he slammed the big book shut, that he was studying, and

     rose to his feet with a hard laugh--the laugh that had presaged more

     caught the glint of a gold tooth, sharp and unpleasant.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1750">
     A moment he stood there, keen, eager, dominant, his hands gripping the

     embodiment of harsh and unrelenting Power--power over men and things,

     Then, as was his habit, translating ideas into immediate action, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1940">
     strode to a door at the far end of the office, flung it open and said:

     "See here a minute, Wally!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_1980">
     "Busy!" came an answering voice, from behind a huge roll-top desk.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2000">
     "Of course! But drop it, drop it. I've got news for you."

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2040">
     "Very. Come in here, a minute. I've got to unload!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2060">
     From behind the big desk rose the figure of a man about five and forty,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2070">
     sandy-haired, long-faced and sallow, with a pair of the coldest,

     just a note of the "sport" in his get-up; a man to fear, a man cool,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2110">
     wary and dangerous--Maxim Waldron, in fact, the Billionaire's right-hand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2120">
     man and confidant. Waldron, for some time affianced to his eldest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2130">
     daughter. Waldron the arch-corruptionist; Waldron, who never yet had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2140">
     been "caught with the goods," but who had financed scores of industrial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2150">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2160">
     smooth, the suave, the perilous.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2180">
     "What now?" asked he, fixing his pale blue eyes on the Billionaire's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2190">
     face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2210">
     "Come in here, and I'll tell you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2230">
     "Right!" And Waldron, brushing an invisible speck of dust from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2240">
     sleeve of his checked coat, strolled rather casually into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2250">
     Billionaire's office.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2270">
     Flint closed the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2290">
     "Well?" asked Waldron, with something of a drawl. "What's the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2300">
     excitement?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2320">
     "See here," began the great financier, stimulated by the drug. "We've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2330">
     been wasting our time, all these years, with our petty monopolies of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2340">
     beef and coal and transportation and all such trifles!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2360">
     "So?" And Waldron drew from his pocket a gold cigar-case, monogrammed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2370">
     with diamonds. "Trifles, eh?" He carefully chose a perfecto. "Perhaps;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2380">
     but we've managed to rub along, eh? Well, if these are trifles, what's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2390">
     on?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2410">
     "Air!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2430">
     "Air?" Waldron's match poised a moment, as with a slight widening of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2440">
     pale blue eyes he surveyed his partner. "Why--er--what do you mean,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2450">
     Flint?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2470">
     "The Air Trust!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2490">
     "Eh?" And Waldron lighted his cigar.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2510">
     "A monopoly of breathing privileges!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2530">
     "Ha! Ha!" Waldron's laugh was as mirthful as a grave-yard raven's croak.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2540">
     "Nothing to it, old man. Forget it, and stick to--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2560">
     "Of course! I might have expected as much from you!" retorted the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2570">
     Billionaire tartly. "You've got neither imagination nor--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2590">
     "Nor any fancy for wild-goose chases," said Waldron, easily, as he sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2600">
     down in the big leather chair. "Air? Hot air, Flint! No, no, it won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2610">
     do! Nothing to it nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2630">
     For a moment the Billionaire regarded him with a look of intense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2640">
     irritation. His thin lips moved, as though to emit some caustic answer;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2650">
     but he managed to keep silence. The two men looked at each other, a long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2660">
     minute; then Flint began again:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2680">
     "Listen, now, and keep still! The idea came to me not an hour ago, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2690">
     morning, looking over the city, here. We've got a finger on everything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2700">
     but the atmosphere, the most important thing of all. If we could control
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2710">
     _that_--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2730">
     "Of course, I understand," interrupted the other, blowing a ring of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2740">
     smoke. "Unlimited power and so on. Looks very nice, and all. Only, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2750">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2760">
     can't control it, any more than the ocean. Talk about monopolizing the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2790">
     "Can't be done, eh?" exclaimed Flint, warmly, sitting down on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2800">
     desk-top and levelling a big-jointed forefinger at his partner. "That's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2810">
     what every new idea has had to meet. It's no argument! People scoffed at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2820">
     the idea of gas lighting when it was new. Called it 'burning smoke,' and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2830">
     made merry over it. That was as recently as 1832. But ten years later,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2840">
     gas-illumination was in full sway.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2860">
     "Electric lighting met the same objection. And remember the objection to

    </p>

     [Illustration: "Can't be done, Eh?" said Flint.]
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2950">
     "Granted," put in Waldron, "that my objection is futile, just what's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2960">
     your idea?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2980">
     "This!" And Flint stabbed at him with his forefinger, while the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_2990">
     financier regarded him with a fishily amused eye. "Every human being in

     the average, 16 cubic feet of air every hour, or about 400 a day. The

     total amount of oxygen actually absorbed in the 24 hours by each person,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3060">
     "Well?" drawled the other.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3080">
     "Don't you see?" snapped Flint, irritably. "Imagine that we extract
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3090">
     oxygen from the air. Then--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3110">
     "You might as well try to dip up the ocean with a spoon," said Waldron,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3120">
     "as try to vitiate the atmosphere of the whole world, by any means

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3150">
     "Look here!" exclaimed the Billionaire. "It only needs a reduction of 10

     "Of course, of course!" interposed Waldron, calmly, eyeing his smoke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3300">
     "Don't get excited, Flint. Rome wasn't built in a day. There may be

     Waldron vouchsafed no reply, but merely eyed his partner with cold

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3630">
     "Bring whatever literature you have on liquid air, nitrogen extraction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3640">
     from the atmosphere, and so on. Understand? And come at once!"

     "That's all! Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3700">
     Smiling dourly, with satisfaction, he hung up and shoved the telephone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3710">
     away again, then turned to his still reflecting partner, who had now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3720">
     hoisted his patent leather boots to the window sill and seemed absorbed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3730">
     in regarding their gloss through a blue veil of nicotine.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3750">
     "Herzog," announced the Billionaire, "will be here in ten minutes, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3760">
     we'll get down to business."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3780">
     "So?" languidly commented the immaculate Waldron. "Well, much as I'd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3790">
     like to flatter your astuteness, Flint, I'm bound to say you're barking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3800">
     up a false trail, this time! Beef, yes. Steel, yes. Railroads,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3810">
     steamships, coal, iron, wheat, yes. All tangible, all concrete, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3820">
     susceptible of being weighed, measured, put in figures, fenced and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3830">
     bounded, legislated about and so on and so forth. But _air_--!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3850">
     He snapped his manicured fingers, to show his well-considered contempt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3860">
     for the Billionaire's scheme, and, throwing away his smoked-out cigar,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3870">
     chose a fresh one.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3890">
     Flint made no reply, but with an angry grunt flung a look of scorn at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3900">
     the calm and placid one. Then, furtively opening his desk drawer, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3910">
     once more sought the little vial and took two more pellets--an action
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3920">
     which Waldron, without moving his head, complacently observed in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3930">
     heavily-bevelled mirror that hung between the windows.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3950">
     "Air," murmured Waldron, suavely. "Hot air, Flint?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3970">
     No answer, save another grunt and the slamming of the desk-drawer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_3990">
     And thus, in silence, the two men, masters of the world, awaited the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4000">
     coming of the practical scientist, the proletarian, on whom they both,

     at last analysis, had to rely for most of their results.

     THE BAITING OF HERZOG.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4100">
     Herzog was not long in arriving. To be summoned in haste by Isaac Flint,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4110">
     and to delay, was unthinkable. For eighteen years the chemist had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4120">
     lickspittled to the Billionaire. Keen though his mind was, his character
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4130">
     and stamina were those of a jellyfish; and when the Master took snuff,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4140">
     as the saying is, Herzog never failed to sneeze.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4160">
     He therefore appeared, now, in some ten minutes--a fat, rubicund,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4170">
     spectacled man, with a cast in his left eye and two fingers missing, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4180">
     remind him of early days in experimental work on explosives. Under his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4190">
     arm he carried several tomes and pamphlets; and so, bowing first to one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4200">
     financier, then to the other, he stood there on the threshold, awaiting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4210">
     his masters' pleasure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4230">
     "Come in, Herzog," directed Flint. "Got some material there on liquid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4240">
     air, and nitrogen, and so on?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4260">
     "Yes, sir. Just what is it you want, sir?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4280">
     "Sit down, and I'll tell you,"--for the chemist, hat in hand, ventured
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4290">
     not to seat himself unbidden in presence of these plutocrats.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4310">
     Herzog, murmuring thanks for Flint's gracious permission, deposited his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4320">
     derby on top of the revolving book-case, sat down tentatively on the edge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4330">
     of a chair and clutched his books as though they had been so many
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4340">
     shields against the redoubted power of his masters.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4360">
     "See here, Herzog," Flint fired at him, without any preliminaries or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4370">
     beating around the bush, "what do you know about the practical side of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4380">
     extracting nitrogen from atmospheric air? Or extracting oxygen, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4390">
     liquid form? Can it be done--that is, on a commercial basis?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4410">
     "Why, no, sir--yes, that is--perhaps. I mean--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4430">
     "What the devil _do_ you mean?" snapped Flint, while Waldron smiled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4440">
     maliciously as he smoked. "Yes, or no? I don't pay you to muddle things.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4450">
     I pay you to _know_, and to tell me! Get that? Now, how about it?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4470">
     "Well, sir--hm!--the fact is," and the unfortunate chemist blinked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4480">
     through his glasses with extreme uneasiness, "the fact of the matter is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4490">
     that the processes involved haven't been really perfected, as yet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4500">
     Beginnings have been made, but no large-scale work has been done, so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4510">
     far. Still, the principle--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4530">
     "Is sound?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4550">
     "Yes, sir. I imagine--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4570">
     "Cut that! You aren't paid for imagining!" interrupted the Billionaire,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4580">
     stabbing at him with that characteristic gesture. "Just what do you know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4590">
     about it? No technicalities, mind! Essentials, that's all, and in a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4600">
     words!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4620">
     "Well, sir," answered Herzog, plucking up a little courage under this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4630">
     pointed goading, "so far as the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen goes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4640">
     more progress has been made in England and Scandinavia, than here.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4650">
     They're working on it, over there, to obtain cheap and plentiful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4660">
     fertilizer from the air. Nitrogen _can_ be obtained from the air, even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4670">
     now, and made into fertilizers even cheaper than the Chili saltpeter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4680">
     Oxygen is liberated as a by-product, and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4700">
     "Oh, it is, eh? And could it be saved? In liquid form for instance?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4720">
     "I think so, sir. The Siemens &amp; Halske interests, in Germany, are doing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4730">
     it already, on a limited scale. In Norway and Austria, nitrogen has been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4740">
     manufactured from air, for some years."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4760">
     "On a paying, commercial basis?" demanded Flint, while Waldron, now a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4770">
     trifle less scornful, seemed to listen with more interest as his eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4780">
     rested on the rotund form of the scientist.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4800">
     "Yes, sir, quite so," answered Herzog. "It's commercially feasible,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4810">
     though not a very profitable business at best. The gas is utilized in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4820">
     chemical combination with a substantial base, and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4840">
     "No matter about that, just yet," interrupted Flint. "We can have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4850">
     details later. Do you know of any such business as yet, in the United
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4860">
     States?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4880">
     "Well, sir, there's a plant building at Great Falls, South Carolina, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4890">
     the purpose. It is to run by waterpower and will develop 5000 H.P."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4910">
     "Hear that, Waldron?" demanded the Billionaire. "It's already beginning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4920">
     even here! But not one of these plants is working for what I see as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4930">
     prime possibility. No imagination, no grasp on the subject! No wonder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4940">
     most inventors and scientists die poor! They incubate ideas and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4950">
     lack the warmth to hatch them into general application. It takes men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4960">
     like us, Wally--practical men--to turn the trick!" He spoke a bit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4970">
     rapidly, almost feverishly, under the influence of the subtle drug. "Now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4980">
     if _we_ take hold of this game, why, we can shake the world as it has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_4990">
     never yet been shaken! Eh, Waldron? What do you think now?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5010">
     Waldron only grunted, non-committally. Flint with a hard glance at his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5020">
     unresponsive partner, once more turned to Herzog.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5040">
     "See here, now," directed he. "What's the best process now in use?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5060">
     "For what, sir?" ventured the timid chemist.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5080">
     "For the simultaneous production of nitrogen and oxygen, from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5090">
     atmosphere!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5110">
     "Well, sir," he answered, deprecatingly, as though taking a great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5120">
     liberty even in informing his master on a point the master had expressly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5130">
     asked about, "there are three processes. But all operate only on a small
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5140">
     scale."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5160">
     "Who ever told you I wanted to work on a large scale?" demanded Flint,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5170">
     savagely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5190">
     "I--er--inferred--beg pardon, sir--I--" And Herzog quite lost himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5200">
     and floundered hopelessly, while his mismated eyes wandered about the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5210">
     room as though seeking the assurance he so sadly lacked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5230">
     "Confine yourself to answering what I ask you," directed Flint, crisply.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5240">
     "You're not paid to infer. You're paid to answer questions on chemistry,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5250">
     and to get results. Remember _that_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5270">
     "Yes, sir," meekly answered the chemist, while Waldron smiled with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5280">
     cynical amusement. He enjoyed nothing so delightedly as any grilling of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5290">
     an employee, whether miner, railroad man, clerk, ship's captain or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5300">
     what-not. This baiting, by Flint, was a rare treat to him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5320">
     "Go on," commanded the Billionaire, in a badgering tone. "What are the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5330">
     processes?" He eyed Herzog as though the man had been an ox, a dog or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5340">
     even some inanimate object, coldly and with narrow-lidded condescension.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5350">
     To him, in truth, men were no more than Shelley's "plow or sword or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5360">
     spade" for his own purpose--things to serve him and to be ruled--or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5370">
     broken--as best served his ends. "Go on! Tell me what you know; and no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5380">
     more!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5400">
     "Yes, sir," ventured Herzog. "There are three processes to extract
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5410">
     nitrogen and oxygen from air. One is by means of what the German
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5420">
     scientists call _Kalkstickstoff_, between calcium carbide and nitrogen,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5430">
     and the reaction-symbols are--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5450">
     "No matter," Flint waived him, promptly. "I don't care for formulas or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5460">
     details. What I want is results and general principles. Any other way to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5470">
     extract these substances, in commercial quantities, from the air we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5480">
     breathe?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5500">
     "Two others. But one of these operates at a prohibitive cost. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5510">
     other--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5530">
     "Yes, yes. What is it?" Flint slid off the edge of the table and walked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5540">
     over to Herzog; stood there in front of him, and bored down at him with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5550">
     eager eyes, the pupils contracted by morphine, but very bright. "What's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5560">
     the best way?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5580">
     "With the electric arc, sir," answered the chemist, mopping his brow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5590">
     This grilling method reminded him of what he had heard of "Third Degree"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5600">
     torments. "That's the best method, sir."

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5620">
     "Now in use, anywhere?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5640">
     "In Notodden, Norway. They have firebrick furnaces, you understand, sir,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5650">
     with an alternating current of 5000 volts between water-cooled copper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5660">
     electrodes. The resulting arc is spread by powerful electro-magnets,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5670">
     so." And he illustrated with his eight acid-stained fingers. "Spread
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5680">
     out like a disk or sphere of flame, of electric fire, you see."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5700">
     "Yes, and what then?" demanded Flint, while his partner, forgetting now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5710">
     to smile, sat there by the window scrutinizing him. One saw, now, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5720">
     terribly keen and prehensile intellect at work under the mask of assumed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5730">
     foppishness and jesting indifference--the quality, for the most part
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5740">
     masked, which had earned Waldron the nickname of "Tiger" in Wall Street.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5760">
     "What then?" repeated Flint, once more levelling that potent forefinger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5770">
     at the sweating Herzog.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5790">
     "Well, sir, that gives a large reactive surface, through which the air
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5800">
     is driven by powerful rotary fans. At the high temperature of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5810">
     electric arc in air, the molecules of nitrogen and oxygen dissociate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5820">
     into their atoms. The air comes out of the arc, charged with about one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5830">
     per cent. of nitric oxide, and after that--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5850">
     "Jump the details, idiot! Can't you move faster than a paralytic snail?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5860">
     What's the final result?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5880">
     "The result is, sir," answered Herzog, meek and cowed under this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5890">
     harrying, "that calcium nitrate is produced, a very excellent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5900">
     fertilizer. It's a form of nitrogen, you see, directly obtained from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5910">
     air."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5930">
     "At what cost?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5950">
     "One ton of fixed nitrogen in that form costs about $150 or $160."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5970">
     "Indeed?" commented Flint. "The same amount, combined in Chile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_5980">
     saltpeter, comes to--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6000">
     "A little over $300, sir."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6020">
     "Hear that, Wally?" exclaimed the Billionaire, turning to his now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6030">
     interested associate. "Even if this idea never goes a step farther,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6040">
     there's a gold mine in just the production of fertilizer from air! But,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6050">
     after all, that will only be a by-product. It's the oxygen we're after,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6060">
     and must have!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6080">
     He faced Herzog again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6100">
     "Is any oxygen liberated, during the process?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6120">
     "At one stage, yes, sir. But in the present process, it is absorbed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6130">
     also."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6150">
     Flint's eyebrows contracted nervously. For a moment he stood thinking,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6160">
     while Herzog eyed him with trepidation, and Waldron, almost forgetting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6170">
     to smoke, waited developments with interest. The Billionaire, however,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6180">
     wasted but scant time in consideration. It was not money now, he lusted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6190">
     for, but power. Money was, to him, no longer any great desideratum. At
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6200">
     most, it could now mean no more to him than a figure on a check-book or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6210">
     a page of statistics in his private memoranda. But power, unlimited,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6220">
     indisputable power over the whole earth and the fulness thereof, power
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6230">
     which none might dispute, power before which all humanity must bow--God!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6240">
     the lust of it now gripped and shook his soul.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6260">
     Paling a little, but with eyes ablaze, he faced the anxious scientist.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6280">
     "Herzog! See here!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6300">
     "Yes, sir?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6320">
     "I've got a job for you, understand?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6340">
     "Yes, sir. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6360">
     "A big job, and one on which your entire future depends. Put it through,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6380">
     can, and will, mark that! Do you get me?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6400">
     "I--yes, sir--that is, I'll do my best, and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6420">
     "Listen! You go to work at once, immediately, understand? Work out for

     Everything in my laboratories at Oakwood Heights is at your disposal.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6500">
     "If it is--well, you'll be suitably rewarded. And no leaks, now. Not a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6570">
     "Yes, sir. I understand."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6590">
     "All right, then. A fortnight from today, report to me here. And mind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6600">
     you, have something to report, or--!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6620">
     "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6640">
     "Very well! Now, go!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6660">
     Thus dismissed, Herzog gathered together his books and papers, blinked a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6670">
     moment with those peculiar wall-eyes of his, arose and, bowing first to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6680">
     Flint and then to the keenly-watching Waldron, backed out of the office.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6700">
     When the door had closed behind him, Flint turned to his partner with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6710">
     nervous laugh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6730">
     "That's the way to get results, eh?" he exclaimed. "No dilly-dallying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6740">
     and no soft soap; but just lay the lash right on, hard--they jump then,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6750">
     the vermin! Results! That fellow will work his head off, the next two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6760">
     weeks; and there'll be something doing when he comes again. You'll see!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6780">
     Waldron laughed nonchalantly. Once more the mask of indifference had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6790">
     fallen over him, veiling the keen, incisive interest he had shown during
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6800">
     the interview.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6820">
     "Something doing, yes," he drawled, puffing his cigar to a glow. "Only I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6830">
     advise you to choose your men. Some day you'll try that on a real

     man--one of the rough-necks you know, and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6860">
     Flint snapped his fingers contemptuously, gazed at Waldron a moment with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6870">
     unwinking eyes and tugged at his mustache.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6890">
     "When I need advice on handling men, I'll ask for it," he rapped out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6900">
     Then, glancing at the Louis XIV clock: "Past the time for that C.P.S.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6930">
     minds."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6950">
     "Right!" answered the other, and arose, yawning, as though the whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6960">
     subject were of but indifferent interest to him. "It's all moonshine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6970">
     Flint. All a pipe-dream. Defoe's philosophers, who spent their lives
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_6980">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7030">
     Flint smiled sourly, his gold tooth glinting, but made no answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7050">
     "Come along," said his partner, moving toward the door. "They're waiting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7060">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7130">
     Flint, for all reply, merely cast a strange look at his partner, with

     AN INTERLOPER.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7260">
     On the eleventh day after this interview between the two men who,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7270">
     between them, practically held the whole world in their grasp, Herzog
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7280">
     telephoned up from Oakwood Heights and took the liberty of informing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7290">
     Flint that his experiments had reached a point of such success that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7300">
     prayed Flint would condescend to visit the laboratories in person.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7320">
     Flint, after some reflection, decided he would so condescend; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7330">
     forthwith ordered his limousine from his private garage on William
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7340">
     Street. Thereafter he called Waldron on the 'phone, at his Fifth Avenue
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7350">
     address.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7370">
     "Mr. Waldron is not up, yet, sir," a carefully-modulated voice answered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7380">
     over the wire. "Any message I can give him, sir?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7400">
     "Oh, hello! That you, Edwards?" Flint demanded, recognizing the suave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7410">
     tones of his partner's valet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7430">
     "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7450">
     "All right. Tell Waldron I'll call for him in half an hour with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7460">
     limousine. And mind, now, I want him to be up and dressed! We're going
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7470">
     down to Staten Island. Got that?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7490">
     "Yes, sir. Any other message, sir?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7510">
     "No. But be sure you get him up, for me! Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7530">
     Thirty minutes later, Flint's chauffeur opened the door of the big
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7540">
     limousine, in front of the huge Renaissance pile that Waldron's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7550">
     millions had raised on land which had cost him more than as though he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7560">
     had covered it with double eagles; and Flint himself ascended the steps
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7570">
     of Pentelican marble. The limousine, its varnish and silver-plate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7580">
     flashing in the bright spring sun, stood by the curb, purring softly to

     itself with all six cylinders, a thing of matchless beauty and rare

     cost. The chauffeur, on the driver's seat, did not even bother to shut
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7610">
     off the gas, but let the engine run, regardless. To have stopped it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7620">
     would have meant some trifling exertion, in starting again; and since

     Flint never considered such details as a few gallons of gasoline, why
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7640">
     should _he_ care? Lighting a Turkish cigarette, this aristocrat of labor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7650">
     lolled on the padded leather and indifferently--with more of contempt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7660">
     than of interest--regarded a swarm of iron-workers, masons and laborers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7670">
     at work on a new building across the avenue.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7690">
     Flint, meanwhile, had entered the great mansion, its bronze
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7700">
     doors--ravished from the Palazzo Guelfo at Venice--having swung inward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7710">
     to admit him, with noiseless majesty. Ignoring the doorman, he addressed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7720">
     himself to Edwards, who stood in the spacious, mahogany-panelled hall,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7730">
     washing both hands with imaginary soap.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7750">
     "Waldron up, yet, Edwards?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7770">
     "No, sir. He--er--I have been unable--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7790">
     "The devil! Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7810">
     "In his apartments, sir."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7830">
     "Take me up!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7850">
     "He said, sir," ventured Edwards, in his smoothest voice. "He said--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7870">
     "I don't give a damn what he said! Take me up, at once!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7890">
     "Yes, sir. Immediately, sir!" And he gestured suavely toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7900">
     elevator.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7920">
     Flint strode down the hall, indifferent to the Kirmanshah rugs, the rare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7930">
     mosaic floor and stained-glass windows, the Parian fountain and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7940">
     Azeglio tapestries that hung suspended up along the stairway--all old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7950">
     stories to him and as commonplace as rickety odds and ends of furniture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7960">
     might be to any toiler "cribbed, cabin'd and confined" in fetid East
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7970">
     Side tenement or squalid room on Hester Street.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_7990">
     The elevator boy bowed before his presence. Edwards hesitated to enter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8000">
     the private elevator, with this world-master; but Flint beckoned him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8010">
     come along. And so, borne aloft by the smooth force of the electric
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8020">
     motor, they presently reached the upper floor where "Tiger" Waldron
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8030">
     laired in stately splendor, like the nabob that he was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8050">
     Without ceremony, Flint pushed forward into the bed-chamber of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8060">
     mighty one--a chamber richly finished in panels of the rare sea-grape
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8070">
     tree, brought from Pacific isles at great cost of money and some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8080">
     expenditure of human lives; but this latter item was, of course, beneath
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8090">
     consideration.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8110">
     By the softened light which entered through rich curtains, one saw the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8120">
     famous frieze of De Lussac, that banded the apartment, over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8130">
     panelling--the frieze of Bacchantes, naked and unashamed, revelling with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8140">
     Satyrs in an abandon that bespoke the age when the world was young.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8150">
     Their voluptuous forms entwined with clustering grapes and leaves, they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8160">
     poured tipsy libations of red wine from golden chalices; while old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8170">
     Silenus, god of drink, astride a donkey, applauded with maudlin joy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8190">
     Flint, however, had no eyes for this scene which would have gladdened a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8200">
     voluptuary's heart--and which, for that reason was dear to Waldron--but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8210">
     walked toward the huge, four-posted bed where Wally himself, now rather
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8220">
     paler than usual, with bloodshot eyes, was lying. This bed, despite the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8230">
     fact that it had been transported all the way from Tours, France, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8240">
     that it once had belonged to an archbishop, had only too often witnessed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8250">
     its owner's insomnia.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8270">
     "Hm! You're a devil of a man to keep an appointment, aren't you?" Flint
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8280">
     sneered at the master of the house. "Eleven o'clock, and not up, yet!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8300">
     "Pardon me for remarking, my dear Flint," replied Waldron, stretching
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8310">
     himself between the silken sheets and reaching for a cigarette, "that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8320">
     the appointment was not of my making. Also that I was up, last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8330">
     night--this morning, rather--till three-thirty. And in the next place,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8340">
     that scoundrel Hazeltine, trimmed me out of eighty-six thousand in four
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8350">
     hours--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8370">
     "Roulette again, you idiot?" demanded Flint.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8390">
     "And in conclusion," said Wally, "that the bigness of my head and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8400">
     brown taste in my mouth are such as no 'soda and sermons, the morning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8410">
     after' can possibly alleviate. So you understand my dalliance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8430">
     "Damn those workmen!" he exclaimed, with sudden irritation, as a louder
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8440">
     chattering of pneumatic riveters from the new building all at once
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8450">
     clattered in at the window. "A free country, eh? And men are permitted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8460">
     to make _that_ kind of a racket when a fellow wants to sleep! By God, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8470">
     I--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8490">
     "Drop that, Wally, and get up!" commanded Flint. "There's no time for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8500">
     this kind of thing today. Herzog has just informed me his experiments
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8510">
     have brought results. We're going down to Oakwood Heights to sea a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8520">
     things for ourselves. And the quicker you get dressed and in your right
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8530">
     mind, the better. Come along, I tell you!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8550">
     "Still chasing sunbeams from cucumbers, eh?" drawled the magnate,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8560">
     inhaling cigarette smoke and blowing a thin cloud toward the wanton
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8570">
     Bacchantes. He affected indifference, but his dull eyes brightened a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8580">
     trifle in his wan face, deep-lined by the savage dissipations of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8590">
     previous night. "And you insist on dragging me out on the same fatuous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8600">
     errand?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8620">
     "Don't be an ass!" snapped the Billionaire. "Get up and come along. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8630">
     sooner we have this thing under way, the better."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8650">
     "All right, anything to oblige," conceded Waldron, inwardly stirred by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8660">
     an interest he took good care not to divulge in word or look. "Give me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8670">
     just time for a cold plunge, a few minutes with my masseur and my

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8680">
     barber, a bite to eat and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8700">
     Flint laid hold on his partner and shook him roughly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8720">
     "Move, you sluggard!" he commanded. And Tiger Waldron obeyed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8740">
     Forty-five minutes later, the two financiers were speeding down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8750">
     asphalt of the avenue at a good round clip. Flint's gleaming car formed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8760">
     one unit of the never-ending procession of motors which, day and night,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8770">
     year in and year out, spin unceasingly along the great, hard, splendid,

     cruel thoroughfare.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8800">
     "I tell you," Flint was asserting as they swung into Broadway, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8810">
     Twenty-third Street, and headed for South Ferry, "I tell you, Wally,

     the thing is growing vaster and more potent every moment. The longer I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8830">
     look at it, the huger its possibilities loom up! With air under our

     control, as a source of manufacturing alone, we can pull down perfectly

     inconceivable fortunes. We shan't have to send anywhere for our raw

     "With oxygen, nitrogen and liquid air as products, think of the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8910">
     with us, in the refrigerating line. With liquid air, we could sweep that

     market clean. By installing it on our fruit cars and boats, and our beef
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8930">
     cars, the saving effected in many ways would run to millions. The sale
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_8940">
     of nitrogen, for fertilizer, would net us billions. And, above all, the

     Waldron, squinting at his cigar as though to hide the involuntary gleam

     of light that sparkled in his narrow-set eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_9110">
     "Precisely!" assented Flint, smiling his gold-toothed smile. "The

     "But what, now?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_9200">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_9730">
     Waldron answered nothing. In silence the partners watched the press of

     Island ferry, that glorious monument of municipal ownership wrecked by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_9780">

     under way, a minute later, both men left the car and strolled to the

     Flint snapped his fingers with contempt.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11290">
     shining waters of the harbor, brought the two plutocrats to the quiet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11300">
     settlement of Oakwood Heights.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11320">
     Now the blasÃ© chauffeur swung the car sharply to the left, past the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11330">
     aviation field, and so came to the wide-scattered settlement--almost a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11340">
     colony--which, hidden behind high, barb-wire-topped fences, carried on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11350">
     the many and complex activities of the partners' experiment station.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11360">
     Here were the several laboratories where new products were evolved and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11370">
     old ones refined, for Flint's and Waldron's greater profit. Here stood a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11380">
     complete electric power plant, for lighting and heating the works, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11390">
     well as for current to use in the retorts and many powerful machines of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11400">
     the testing works.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11420">
     Here, again, were broad proving grounds, for fuel and explosives; and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11430">
     at one side, stood a low, skylighted group of brick buildings, known as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11440">
     the electro-chemical station. Dormitories and boarding-houses for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11450">
     small army of employees occupied the eastern end of the enclosure,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11460">
     nearest the sea. Over all, high chimney stacks and the aerials of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11470">
     mighty wireless plant dominated the entire works. A private railroad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11480">
     spur pierced the western side of the enclosure, for food and coal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11490">
     supplies, as well as for the handling of the numerous imports and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11500">
     exports of this wonderfully complete feudal domain. As the colony lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11510">
     there basking in the sunshine of early spring, under its drifting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11520">
     streamers of smoke, it seemed an ideal picture of peaceful activities.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11530">
     Here a locomotive puffed, shunting cars; there, a steam-jet flung its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11540">
     plumes of snowy vapor into air; yonder, a steam hammer thundered on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11550">
     massive anvil. And forges rang, and through open windows hummed sounds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11560">
     of industry.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11580">
     And yet, not one of all those sounds but echoed more bitter slavery for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11590">
     men. Not one of all those many activities but boded ill to humanity. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11600">
     the whole plan and purpose of the place was the devising of still wider
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11610">
     forms of human exploitation and enslavement. Its every motive was to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11620">
     serve the greed of Flint and Waldron. Outwardly honest and industrious,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11630">
     it inwardly loomed sinister and terrible, a type and symbol of its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11640">
     masters' swiftly growing power. Such, in its essence, was the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11650">
     experiment station of these two men who lusted for dominion over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11660">
     whole world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11680">
     As the long, glittering car drew up at the main gate of the enclosure, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11690">
     sharp-eyed watchman peered through a sliding wicket therein. Satisfied
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11700">
     by his inspection, he withdrew; and at once the big gate rolled back,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11710">
     smoothly actuated by electricity. The car purred onward, into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11720">
     enclosure. When the gate had closed noiselessly behind it, the chauffeur
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11730">
     ran it down a splendidly paved roadway, swung to the right, past the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11740">
     machine shops, and drew it to a stand in front of the administration
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11750">
     building.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11770">
     Flint and his partner alighted, and stood for a moment surveying the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11780">
     scene with satisfaction. Then Flint turned to the chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11800">
     "Put the car in the garage," he directed. "We may not want it till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11810">
     afternoon."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11830">
     The blasÃ© one touched his cap and nodded, in obedience. Then, as the car
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11840">
     withdrew, the partners ascended the broad steps.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11860">
     "Good chap, that Herrick," commented Waldron, casting a glance at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11870">
     retreating chauffeur. "Quick-witted, and mum. Give me a man who knows
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11880">
     how to mind _and_ keep still about it, every time!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11900">
     "Right," assented Flint. "Obedience is the first of all virtues, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11910">
     second is silence. Well, it looks to me as though we had the whole world
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11920">
     coming our way, now, along that very same path of virtue. Once we get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11930">
     this air proposition really to working, the world will obey. It will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11940">
     have to! And as for silence, we can manage that, too. The mere turn of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11950">
     valve, and--!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11970">
     Waldron smiled grimly, as though in derision of what he seemed to think
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11980">
     his partner's chimerical hopes, but made no answer. Together they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_11990">
     entered the administration building. Five minutes later, Herzog, their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12000">
     servile experimenter, stood bowing and cringing before them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12020">
     "Got it, Herzog?" demanded Flint, while Waldron lighted still another of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12030">
     those costly cigars--each one worth a good mechanic's daily wage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12050">
     "Yes, sir, I believe so, sir," the scientist replied, depreciatingly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12060">
     "That is, at least, on a small scale. Two weeks was the time you allowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12070">
     me, sir, but--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12090">
     "I know. You've done it in eleven days," interrupted, the Billionaire.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12100">
     "Very well. I knew you could. You'll lose nothing by it. So no more of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12110">
     that. Show us what you've done. Everything all ready?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12130">
     "Quite ready, sir," the other answered. "If you'll be so good as to step
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12140">
     into the electro-chemical building?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12160">
     Flint very graciously signified his willingness thus to condescend; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12170">
     without delay, accompanied by the still incredulous Waldron, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12180">
     followed by Herzog, he passed out of the administration building,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12190">
     through a covered passage and into the electro-chemical works.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12210">
     A variety of strange odors and stranger sounds filled this large brick
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12220">
     structure, windowless on every side and lighted only by broad skylights
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12230">
     of milky wire-glass--this arrangement being due to the extreme secrecy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12240">
     of many processes here going forward. The partners had no intention that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12250">
     any spying eyes should ever so much as glimpse the work in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12260">
     department; work involving foods, fuels, power, lighting, almost the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12270">
     entire range of the vast network of exploiting media they had already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12280">
     flung over a tired world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12300">
     "This way, gentlemen," ventured Herzog, pointing toward a metal door at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12310">
     the left of the main room. He unlocked this, which was guarded by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12320">
     combination lock, like that of a bank vault, and waited for them to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12330">
     enter; then closed it after them, and made quite sure the metal door was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12340">
     fast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12360">
     A peculiar, pungent smell greeted the partners' nostrils as they glanced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12370">
     about the inner laboratory. At one side an electric furnace was glowing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12380">
     with graphite crucibles subjected to terrific heat. On the other a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12390">
     dynamo was humming. Before them a broad, tiled bench held a strange
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12400">
     assortment of test tubes, retorts and complex apparatus of glass and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12410">
     gleaming metal. The whole was lighted by a strong white light from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12420">
     above, through the milk-hued glass--one of Herzog's own inventions, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12430">
     the way; a wonderful, light-intensifying glass, which would bend but not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12440">
     break; an invention which, had he himself profited by it, would have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12450">
     brought him millions, but which the partners had exploited without ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12460">
     having given him a single penny above his very moderate salary.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12480">
     "Is that it?" demanded Flint, a glitter lighting up his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12490">
     morphia-contracted pupils. He jerked his thumb at a complicated nexus of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12500">
     tubes, brass cylinders, coiled wires and glistening retorts which stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12510">
     at one end of the broad work-bench.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12530">
     "That is it, sir," answered Herzog, apologetically, while "Tiger"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12540">
     Waldron's hard face hardened even more. "Only an experimental model, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12550">
     understand, sir, but--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12570">
     "It gets results?" queried Flint sharply. "It produces oxygen and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12580">
     nitrogen on a scale that indicates success, with adequate apparatus?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12600">
     "Yes, sir. I believe so, sir. No doubt about it; none whatever."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12620">
     "Good!" exclaimed the Billionaire. "Now show us!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12640">
     "With pleasure, sir. But first, let me explain, a little."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12660">
     "Well, what?" demanded Flint. His partner, meanwhile, had drawn near the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12670">
     apparatus, and was studying it with a most intense concentration. Plain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12680">
     to see, beneath this man's foppish exterior and affected cynicism, dwelt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12690">
     powerful purposes and keen intelligence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12710">
     "Explain what?" repeated the Billionaire. "As far as details go, I'm not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12720">
     interested. All I want is results. Go ahead, Herzog; start your machine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12730">
     and let me see what it can do."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12750">
     "I will, sir," acceded the scientist. "But first, with your permission,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12760">
     I'll point out a few of its main features, and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12780">
     "Damn the main features!" cried Flint. "Get busy with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12790">
     demonstration!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12810">
     "Hold on, hold on," now interrupted Waldron. "Let him discourse, if he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12820">
     wants to. Ever know a scientist who wasn't primed to the muzzle with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12830">
     expositions? Here, Herzog," he added, turning to the inventor, "I'll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12840">
     listen, if nobody else will."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12860">
     Undecided, Herzog smiled nervously. Even Flint had to laugh at his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12870">
     indecision.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12890">
     "All right, go on," said the Billionaire. "Only for God's sake, make it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12900">
     brief!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12920">
     Herzog, thus adjured, cleared his throat and blinked uneasily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12940">
     "Oxygen," he said. "Yes, I can produce it quickly, easily and in large
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12950">
     quantities. As a gas, or as a liquid, which can be shipped to any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12960">
     desired point and there transformed into gaseous form. Liquid air can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12970">
     also be produced by this same machine, for refrigerating purposes. You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12980">
     understand, of course, that when liquid air evaporates, it is only the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_12990">
     nitrogen that goes back into the atmosphere at 313 degrees below zero.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13000">
     The residue is pure liquid oxygen. In other words, this apparatus will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13010">
     make money as a liquid air plant, and furnish you oxygen as a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13020">
     by-product.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13040">
     "It will also turn out nitrogen, for fertilizing purposes. The income
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13050">
     from a full-sized machine, on this pattern, from all three sources,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13060">
     should be very large indeed."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13080">
     "Good," put in Waldron. "And liquid air, for example, would cost how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13090">
     much to produce?"

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13930">
     added some memoranda, based on what Herzog had just told him, as well as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13940">
     observations on the machine itself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13960">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_13980">

     on the wall. "Where's the juice?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14010">
     "One second, sir," answered the scientist. Again he peeked through the

     glowing bull's-eye. Then, his face slightly pale, his bulging eyes

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14030">
     blinking nervously, he took two small flint glass bottles, set them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14040">
     under a couple of pipettes, and deftly made connections.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14060">
     "Oxygen cocktail for mine," laughed Waldron, to cover a certain emotion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14070">
     he could not help feeling at sight of the actual operation of a process

     Neither Flint nor the inventor vouchsafed even a smile. The Billionaire

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14130">
     peered curiously at the apparatus. Herzog, with a quick gesture, turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14140">
     a small silver faucet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14160">
     "Oxygen! Unlimited oxygen!" he exclaimed. "I have found the process,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14170">
     gentlemen, commercially practicable. Oxygen!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14190">
     Even as he spoke, a lambent, sparkling liquid began to flow through the

     up with triumph. Waldron, despite his assumed nonchalance, felt the

     hunting thrill of Wall street, the quick stab of exultation when victory
    </p>

     seemed well in hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14250">
     "These bottles," said Herzog, "are double, constructed on the principle

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14270">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14280">
     time, gentlemen, you can handle tons of these gases, if you

     He turned the faucet, disconnected the flask and handed it to Flint.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14400">
     "There, sir," he remarked, "is a half-pint of pure liquid oxygen, drawn

     satisfied, sir?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14450">
     Flint nodded, curtly.

     "You'll do, Herzog," he replied--his very strongest form of

     "Ozone, you mean?"

     "None, sir. Here, allow me."

     Herzog took the flask, pressed a little spring and liberated the top. At

     once a whitish vapor began to coil from the neck of the bottle.

     "Hm!" grunted Waldron, smiling. "Mountain winds and sea breezes have

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14810">
     "You're right, Wally," answered the Billionaire. "If this works out on a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14850">
     Yielding to the influence of the wonderful, life-giving gas, the rather

     odors, and vitiated by its recent loss of oxygen, had begun to freshen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14880">
     and purify itself in an astonishing manner. One would have thought that

     through an open window, close at hand, the purest ocean breeze was

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_14910">
     of the Billionaire. Waldron's big chest expanded and his eye brightened.

     Even the meek Herzog stood straighter and looked more the man, under the

     never known by him--for already the subtle gas was beginning to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15110">

     Once we get our grip on that, the world will be--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15140">
     Waldron checked him just in time.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15160">
     "Enough of this," he interrupted sharply. "I admit, I'm not myself, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15170">
     this rich atmosphere. I know _you're_ feeling it, already, Flint. Come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15180">
     along out of this, where we can regain our aplomb. We've seen enough,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15190">
     for once."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15210">
     He turned to Herzog.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15230">
     "For God's sake, man," cried he, "cork that magic bottle of yours,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15240">
     before all the oxygen-genii escape, or you'll have us both under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15250">
     table! And, see here," he added, pulling out his check-book, while Flint
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15260">
     stared in amazed disgust. "Here, take a blank check." He took his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15270">
     fountain pen and scrawled his name on one. "The amount? That's up to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15280">
     you. Now, let us out," he bade, as Herzog stood there regarding the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15290">
     check with entire uncomprehension. "Out, I say, before I get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15300">
     extravagant!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15320">
     Herzog, perfectly comprehending the magnates' unusual conduct as due to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15330">
     oxygen-intoxication in its initial stage, made no comment, but walked to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15340">
     the door, spun the combination and flung it open.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15360">
     "Glad to have had the pleasure of demonstrating the process to you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15370">
     gentlemen," said he. "If you're convinced it's practicable, I'm at your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15380">
     orders for any larger extension of the work. Have you any other question
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15390">
     or suggestion?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15410">
     Neither magnate answered. Flint was trying hard to hold his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15420">
     self-control. Waldron, red-faced now and highly stimulated, looked as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15430">
     though he had been drinking even more than usual.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15450">
     Both passed out of the laboratory with rather unsteady steps. Together
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15460">
     they retraced their way to the administration building; and there, safe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15470">
     at last in the private inner office, with the door locked, they sat down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15480">
     and stared at each other with expressions of amazement.

     A FREAK OF FATE.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15570">
     Waldron was the first to speak. With a sudden laugh, boisterous and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15580">
     wild, he cried:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15600">
     "Flint, you old scoundrel, you're drunk!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15620">
     "Drunk yourself!" retorted the Billionaire, half starting from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15630">
     chair, his fist clenched in sudden passion. "How dare you--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15650">
     "Dare? I dare anything!" exclaimed Waldron. "Yes, I admit it--I _am_

     half seas over. That ozone--God! what a stimulant! Must be some

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15670">
     wonderfully powerful form. If we--could market it--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15690">
     Flint sank back in his chair, waving an extravagant hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15710">
     "Market it?" he answered. "Of course we can market it, and will! Drunk

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15720">
     or sober, Wally, I know what I'm talking about. The power now in our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15730">
     grasp has never yet been equalled on earth. On the one side, we can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15740">
     half-stifle every non-subscriber to our service, or wholly stifle every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15750">
     rebel against us. On the other, we can simply saturate every subscriber
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15760">
     with health and energy, or even--if they want it--waft them to paradise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15770">
     on the wings of ozone. The old Roman idea of 'bread and circus' to rule
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15780">
     the mob, was child's play compared to this! Science has delivered the

     over every living, breathing thing!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15820">
     He fell silent, pondering the vast future; and Waldron, gazing at him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15830">
     with sparkling eyes, nodded with keen satisfaction. Thus for a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15840">
     moments they sat, looking at each other and letting imagination ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15850">
     riot; and as they sat, the sudden, stimulating effect of the condensed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15860">
     oxygen died in their blood, and calmer feelings ensued.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15880">
     Presently Waldron spoke again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15900">
     "Let's get down to brass tacks," said he, drawing his chair up to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15910">
     table. "I'm almost myself again. The subtle stuff has got out of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15920">
     brain, at last. Generalities and day-dreams are all very well, Flint,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15930">
     but we've got to lay out some definite line of campaign. And the sooner
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15940">
     we get to it the better."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15960">
     "Hm!" sneered Flint. "If it's not more practical than your action in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15970">
     giving Herzog that blank check, it won't be worth much. As an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15980">
     extravagant action, Wally, I've never seen it equalled. I'm astonished,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_15990">
     indeed I am!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16010">
     Waldron laughed easily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16030">
     "Don't worry," he answered his partner. "That temporary aberration of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16040">
     judgment, due to oxygen-stimulus, will have no results. Herzog won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16050">
     dare fill out the check, anyhow, because he knows he'd get into trouble
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16060">
     if he did; and even though he should, he can collect nothing. I'll have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16070">
     payment stopped, at once, on that number. No danger, Flint!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16090">
     "I don't know," mused the Billionaire. "It may be that this man has us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16100">
     just a little under his thumb. He, and he alone, understands the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16110">
     process. We've got to treat him with due consideration, or he may leave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16120">
     us and carry his secret to others--to Masterson, for instance, or the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16130">
     Amalgamated people, or--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16150">
     "Nothing doing on that, old man!" interrupted "Tiger." "Have no fear.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16160">
     The first move he makes, off to Sing Sing he goes, the way we jobbed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16170">
     Parker Hayes. Slade and the Cosmos Agency can take care of _him_, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16180">
     right, if he asserts himself!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16200">
     "Very likely," answered Flint, who had now at last entirely recovered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16210">
     his sang-froid. "But in that event, our work would be at a standstill.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16220">
     No, Waldron, we mustn't oppose this fellow. Better let the check go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16230">
     through, if he has nerve enough to fill it out and cash it. He won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16240">
     dare gouge very deep; and no matter what he takes, it won't be a drop in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16250">
     the ocean, compared to the golden flood now almost within our grasp!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16270">
     Waldron pondered a moment, then nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16290">
     "All right. Correct," he finally answered. "So then, we can dismiss that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16300">
     trifle from our minds. Now, to work! We've got the process we were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16310">
     after. What next?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16330">
     "First of all," answered the Billionaire, "we'll let this Herzog
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16340">
     understand that he's to have a share in the results; that in this, as in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16350">
     everything so far, he's merely a tool--and that when tools lose their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16360">
     cutting edge we break 'em. He's a meek devil. We can hold _him_ easily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16370">
     enough."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16390">
     "Right. And then?" asked Waldron.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16410">
     "Then? First of all, a good, big, wide-sweeping publicity campaign. That
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16420">
     must begin today, to prepare opinion for the forthcoming development of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16430">
     the new idea."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16450">
     "Henderson can handle that, all right," said Wally, leaning forward in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16460">
     his chair. "Give him the idea, and turn him loose, and he'll get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16470">
     results. A clever dog, that. He and his press bureau, working through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16480">
     all the big dailies and many of the magazines, can turn this country
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16490">
     upside down in six months. Let him get on this job, and before you know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16500">
     it the public will be demanding, be fighting for a chance to subscribe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16510">
     to the new ventilating-service. That part of it is easy!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16530">
     "Yes, you're right," replied Flint. "We'll see Henderson no later than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16540">
     this afternoon. He and his writers can lay out a series of popular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16550">
     articles and advertisements, to be run as pure reading matter, with no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16560">
     distinguishing mark that they _are_ ads, which will get the country--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16570">
     whole world, in fact--coming our way."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16590">
     "Good," the other assented. "Meantime, we can begin installing oxygen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16600">
     machines on a big scale, a huge scale, to supply the demand that's bound
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16610">
     to arise. Where do you think we'd best manufacture? Herzog says water
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16620">
     power is the correct thing. We might use Niagara--use some of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16630">
     surplus power we already own there."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16650">
     "Niagara would do, very well," answered Flint. He had once more taken
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16660">
     out his little morocco-covered note book, and was now jotting down some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16670">
     further memoranda. "It's a good location. Pipe-lines could easily be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16680">
     extended, from it, to cover practically a quarter to a third of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16690">
     United States. Eventually we'll put in another plant in Chicago, one in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16700">
     Denver and one on the Pacific Coast. Then, in time, there must be

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16710">
     distributing centers in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. But for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16720">
     present, we'll begin with the Niagara plant. After we get that under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16730">
     full operation, the others will develop in due course of time."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16750">
     "Our charter covers this new line of work. There will be no need of any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16760">
     legal technicalities," said Waldron, with a smile. "Some charter, if I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16770">
     do say it, who shouldn't. I drew it, you remember. Nothing much in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16780">
     way of possible business-extension got past _me_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16800">
     Flint nodded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16820">
     "You're right," he answered. "Nothing stands in our way, now. Positively
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16830">
     nothing. We have land, power and capital without limit. We have the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16840">
     process. We control press, law, courts, judges, military and every other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16850">
     form of government. All we need look out for is to secure public
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16860">
     confidence and keep the bandage on the eyes of the world till our system
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16870">
     is actually in operation--then there will be no redress, no come back,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16880">
     no possible rebellion. As I've already said, Wally, we'll have the whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16890">
     world by the windpipe; and let the mob howl _then_, if they dare!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16910">
     "Yes, let 'em howl!" chimed in "Tiger," with a snarl that proved his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16920">
     nickname no misnomer. "Inside of a year we'll have them all where we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16930">
     want them. You were right, Flint, when you called oil, coal, iron and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16940">
     all the rest of it mere petty activities. Air--ah! that's the talk! Once

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_16950">

     Flint himself, to rule the master or to wreck him, and to seize in his

     note-book and making careful memoranda, saw nothing of all this.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17050">
     Waldron, an inveterate smoker, lighted a fresh cigar, leaned back,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17060">
     surveyed his partner and indulged in a short inner laugh, which hardly

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17070">
     curved his cruel lips, but which hardened still more those pale-blue,

     steely eyes of his.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17100">
     "All right," said he, at last. "Enough of this, Flint. Let's get back to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17110">
     town, now, and have a conference with Henderson. That's the first step.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17120">
     By tonight, the whole campaign of publicity must be mapped out. Come,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17160">
     Five minutes later, having left orders that Herzog was to attend upon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17170">
     them in their private offices, next morning, they had ordered the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17180">
     limousine and were making way along the hard road toward the gate of the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17210">
     The gate opened to let them pass, then swung and locked again, behind

     them. At a good clip, the powerful car picked up speed on the homeward

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17230">
     way. The two magnates, exultant and flushed with the consciousness of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17240">
     coming victory, lolled in the deeply-cushioned seat and spoke of power.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17260">
     As they swung past the aviation field and neared the Oakwood Heights
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17270">
     station, a train pulled out. Down the road came tramping a workingman in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17280">
     overalls and jumper, with a canvas bag of tools swinging from his brawny
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17290">
     right hand. As he walked, striding along with splendid energy, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17300">
     whistled to himself--no cheap ragtime air, but Handel's Largo, with an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17310">
     appreciation which bespoke musical feeling of no common sort.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17330">
     The Billionaire caught sight of him, just as the car slowed to take the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17340">
     sharp turn by the station. Instant recognition followed. Flint's eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17350">
     narrowed sharply.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17370">
     "Hm! The same fellow," he grunted to himself. "The same rascal who stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17380">
     beside us on the ferry boat, as we were talking over our plans. Now,
    </p>

     what the devil?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17410">
     Shadowed by a kind of instinctive uneasiness, not yet definite or clear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17420">
     but more in the nature of a premonition of trouble, Flint gazed fixedly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17430">
     at the mechanic as the car swung round the bend in the road. The glance
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17440">
     was returned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17460">
     Yielding to some kind of imperative curiosity, the Billionaire leaned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17470">
     over the side of the car--leaned out, with his coat flapping in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17480">
     stiff wind--and for a moment peered back at the disquieting workman.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17500">
     Then the car swept him out of sight, and Flint resumed his seat again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17520">
     He did not know--for he had not seen it happen--that in that moment the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17530">
     slippery, leather-covered note-book had slid from his lolling coat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17540">
     pocket and had fallen with a sharp slap on the white macadam, skidded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17550">
     along and come to rest in the ditch.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17570">
     The workingman, however, who had paused and turned to look after the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17580">
     speeding car, _he_ had seen all this.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17600">
     A moment he stood there, peering. Then, retracing his steps with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17610">
     resolution he picked up the little book and slid it into the pocket of

     his jeans.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17640">
     Deserted was the road. Not a soul was to be seen, save the crossing

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17660">
     everything but a rank cob pipe. The workman's act had not been noticed.

     Nobody had observed him. Nobody knew. Not a living creature had

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17810">
     Oakwood Heights laboratory and instructed Herzog, in person, to make a
    </p>

     careful search for it and to report results inside an hour. Even though

     some of the essentials of his plan were written in a code of his own

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17870">
     "Damn the luck!" he ejaculated, pacing the office floor, his fists
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17880">
     knotted. "If it had been a pocket book with a few thousand inside, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17890">
     would have been a trifle. But to lose my plan of campaign--God grant no

     Waldron, slyly observing him, could not suppress a smile.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17940">
     "Calling on God, eh?" sneered he. "You _must_ be agitated. I haven't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17950">
     heard that kind of entreaty on your lips, Flint, since the year of the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_17990">
     alarm. It would take a man of extraordinary acumen to read _your_

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18000">
     hieroglyphics! Cheer up, Flint. There's really nothing to excite you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18020">
     The Billionaire thus adjured, sat down and tried to calm his agitation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18040">
     "Rotten luck, eh?" he queried. "But after all, Herzog is likely to find
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18050">
     the book. And even if he doesn't, I guess we're safe enough. The very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18060">
     boldness of the plan--supposing even that the finder could grasp
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18070">
     it--would put it outside the seeming range of the possible. It's hardly

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18100">
     "All right, then, let it go at that," said Waldron. "And now, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18110">
     business. Suppose, for example, you've got a perfectly unlimited supply
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18120">
     of oxygen-gas and liquid. How are you going to market it? Just what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18130">
     details have you worked out?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18150">
     Flint pondered a moment, before replying. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18170">
     "Of course you understand, Wally, I can't give you every point. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18180">
     whole thing will be an evolution, and new ideas and processes, new uses
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18190">
     and demands will develop as time passes. But in the main, my idea is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18200">
     this: The big producing stations will steadily extract oxygen from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18210">
     atmosphere, thus leaving the air increasingly poorer and less adapted to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18220">
     sustaining human life.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18240">
     "I shall store the oxygen in vast tanks, like the ordinary gas-tanks to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18250">
     be found in every city, only much bigger. These tanks will be fed by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18260">
     pipe-lines from the central stations, thus."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18280">
     Flint drew toward him a sheet of his heavily embossed letter-paper, and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18290">
     picking up a pencil, began to sketch a rough diagram. Waldron, making no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18300">
     comment, followed every stroke with keen interest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18320">
     "From these tanks," the Billionaire continued, "smaller pipes will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18330">
     convey the gaseous oxygen to every house taking our service."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18350">
     "Just like ordinary gas?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18370">
     "Precisely. Each room will be fitted with an oxygen jet apparatus,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18380">
     something like a gas burner, with a safety device to prevent over supply
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18390">
     and avoid the dangers of combustion."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18410">
     "Combustion?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18430">
     "Yes. In pure oxygen, a glowing bit of wire will burst into flame. Your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18440">
     cigar, there, would catch fire, from the merest spark in its inmost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18450">
     folds. Too much oxygen in a room not only intoxicates the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18460">
     occupants--we've already seen _that_ effect--but also develops a great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18470">
     fire risk. So we shall have to make some provision for that, Wally. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18480">
     will be absolutely essential."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18500">
     "All right. Allowing it's been made, what then?" asked "Tiger," with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18510">
     extraordinary interest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18530">
     "Can't you see? We'll have every household under our absolute thumb?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18540">
     And Flint pressed his thumb on the table to illustrate. "My God, man,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18550">
     think of it! Every city honeycombed by our pipes--yes, and every village
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18560">
     and hamlet too, and even every farm house that can afford it! At first,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18570">
     the cost will be very low, till people have become accustomed to ozone

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18590">
     once and for all time. Where we can't pipe in the ozone, we can use

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18600">
     portable vaporizers, to be supplied once a month, and of sufficient

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18610">
     capacity to keep the air of an average-sized house perfectly pure for

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18640">
     "Pure? More than pure! Exhilarating, life-giving, delicious! Under this

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18660">
     before. They'll grow in size and weight, in health and intelligence,

     the world!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18710">
     "Bunk!" sneered Wally. "That's all very well for your prospectuses and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18720">
     newspaper articles, old man, but the fact is we don't give a damn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18730">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18740">
     My motto is, Get 'em and do good, if you can--but _get_ 'em anyhow! So

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18750">
     you had better can the philanthropic part of it. Just show me the cash,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18780">
     Flint shot a grim look at his partner, then continued:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18800">
     "Don't be flippant, Wally. This is a serious business and must be

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18810">
     treated as such. In addition to the respiratory service, we can put in

     pifflers look like the proverbial thirty cents!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18890">
     "Fine!" exclaimed Waldron, nodding approval. "Also, any time any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18900">
     rebellion develops we can merely shut off the supply in that quarter,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18910">
     and quickly reduce it. Or, again, we can increase the potency of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18920">
     gas, and fairly intoxicate the people, till they stand for anything.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18930">
     Just fancy, now, our pipes connected with the sacred Halls of Congress
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18940">
     and with the White House! Even if any difficulty could possibly be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18950">
     expected from these sources, just imagine how quickly we could nip it in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18960">
     the bud!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18980">
     "Quickly isn't the word, Wally," answered the Billionaire. "I tell you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_18990">
     old man, the world lies in our hands, today. And we have only to close
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19000">
     our fingers, in order to possess it!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19020">
     He glanced at his own fingers, as though he visibly perceived the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19030">
     world lying there for him to squeeze. Waldron's eyes, following the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19040">
     Billionaire's, saw that Flint's hand was trembling, and understood the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19050">
     reason. More than three hours had passed--nay, almost four--since Flint
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19060">
     had had any opportunity to take his necessary dose of morphia. Waldron
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19070">
     arose, paced to the window and stood there looking out over the vast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19080">
     panorama of city, river and harbor, apparently absorbed in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19090">
     contemplation, but really keen to hear what Flint might do.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19110">
     His expectations were not disappointed. Hardly had he turned his back,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19120">
     when he heard the desk-drawer open, furtively, and knew the Billionaire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19130">
     was taking out the little vial of white tablets, dearer to him than ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19140">
     the caress of woman to a Don Juan. A moment later, the drawer closed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19150">
     again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19170">
     "He'll do now, for a while," thought Waldron, with satisfaction. "Let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19180">
     him go the limit, if he likes--the fool! The more he takes, the quicker
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19190">
     I win. It'll kill him yet, the dope will. And _that_ means, my mastery
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19200">
     of the world will be complete. Let him go it! The harder, the better!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19220">
     He turned back toward Flint, again, veiling in that impenetrable face of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19230">
     his the slightest hint or expression which might have told Flint that he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19240">
     understood the Billionaire's vice. If Flint were Vulture, Waldron was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19250">
     Tiger, indeed. And so, for a brief moment, these two soulless men of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19260">
     gold and power stood eyeing each other, in silence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19280">
     Suddenly Waldron spoke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19300">
     "There's one thing you've forgotten to speak of, Flint," he said.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19320">
     "And that is?" demanded the other, already calmed by the quick action of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19330">
     the subtle, enslaving drug.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19350">
     "The effect on the world's poor--on the toiling millions! The results of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19360">
     this innovation, in slum, and slave-quarter, and in the haunts of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19370">
     poverty. Your talk has all been of the middle and upper classes, and of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19380">
     the benefits accruing to them, from increased oxygen-consumption. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19390">
     how about the others? Every ounce of oxygen you take out of the air,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19400">
     leaves it just so much poorer. Store thousands of tons of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19410">
     life-giving gas, in monster tanks, and you vitiate the entire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19420">
     atmosphere. How about that? How can even the well-to-do breathe, then,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19430">
     out-doors, to say nothing of the poverty-stricken millions?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19450">
     Flint grimaced, showing a glint of his gold tooth--his substitute for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19460">
     smile.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19480">
     "That's all reckoned for," he answered. "I thought I made it quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19490">
     clear, in our previous talk. To begin with, we will withdraw the oxygen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19500">
     from the atmosphere so slowly that at first there won't be any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19510">
     noticeable effect on the out-door air. For a while, the only thing that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19520">
     will be noticed by the world will be that our gas service, to private
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19530">
     residences and institutions, will result in greatly increased comfort
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19540">
     and health to the better classes. And the cost will be so low--at first,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19550">
     mind you, only at first--that every family of any means at all can take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19560">
     it. In fact, Wally, we can afford practically to give away the service,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19570">
     for the first year, until we get our grip firmly fixed on the throat of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19580">
     the world. Do you get the idea?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19600">
     Waldron nodded, as he drew leisurely on his cigar.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19620">
     "Practical to a degree," he answered. "That is, until the poor begin to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19630">
     gasp for breath. But what then?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19650">
     "By the time the outer atmosphere really begins to show the effect of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19660">
     withdrawing a considerable percentage of the oxygen," Flint answered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19670">
     "we will have our pocket respirators on the market. Well-to-do people
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19680">
     will as soon think of going out without their shoes, as they will with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19690">
     their respirators. No, there won't be any visible tubes or attachments,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19700">
     Wally. Nothing of that kind. Only, each person will carry a properly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19710">
     insulated cake of solidified oxygen that will evaporate through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19720">
     special apparatus and surround him with a normally rich atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19730">
     And--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19750">
     "Yes, but the poor? The workers? What of them?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19770">
     "Devil take _them_, if it comes to that!" retorted Flint, with some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19780">
     heat. "Who ever gives them any serious attention, as it is? Who bothers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19790">
     about their health? They eat and drink and breathe the leavings,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19800">
     anyhow--eat the cheapest and most adulterated food, drink the vilest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19810">
     slop and breathe the most vitiated slum air. Nobody cares, except
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19820">
     perhaps those crazy Socialists that once in a while get up on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19830">
     street-corner and howl about the rights of man and all that rubbish!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19840">
     Working-class? What do _I_ care about the cattle? Let them die, if they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19850">
     want to! D'you suppose, for one minute, I'm going to limit or delay this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19860">
     big innovation, because there's a working-class that may suffer?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19880">
     "They'll do more than suffer, Flint, if you seriously depreciate the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19890">
     atmosphere. They'll die!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19910">
     "Well, let them, and be damned to them!" retorted Flint, already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19920">
     showing symptoms of drug-stimulation. Waldron, smoking meanwhile, eyed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19930">
     him with a dangerous smile lurking in his cold eyes. "Let them, I say!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19940">
     They die off, now, twice or thrice as fast as the better classes, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19950">
     what difference does it make? Great breeders, those people are. The more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19960">
     they die, the faster they multiply. Let them go their way and do as they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19970">
     like, so long as they don't interfere with _us_! The only really
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19980">
     important factor to reckon on is this, that with an impoverished air to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_19990">
     breathe, their rebellious spirit will die out--the dogs!--and we'll have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20000">
     no more talk of social revolution. We'll draw their teeth, all right
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20010">
     enough; or rather, twist the bowstring round their damned necks so tight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20020">
     that all their energy, outside of work, will be consumed in just keeping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20030">
     alive. Revolution, then? Forget it, Waldron! We'll kill _that_ viper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20040">
     once and for all!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20060">
     "Good idea, Flint," the other replied, with approbation. "Only a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20070">
     master-mind like yours could have conceived it. I'm with you, all right

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20080">
     enough. Only, tell me--do you really believe we can put this whole

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20090">
     program through, without a hitch? Without a leak, anywhere? Without

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20100">
     barricades in the streets, wild-eyed agitators howling, machine-guns

     chattering, and Hell to pay?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20130">
     Flint smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20150">
     "Wait and see!" he growled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20170">
     "Maybe you're right," his partner answered. "But slow and easy is the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20180">
     only way."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20200">
     "Slow and easy," Flint assented. "Of course we can't go too fast. In
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20210">
     1850, for example, do you suppose the public would have tolerated the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20220">
     sudden imposition of monopolies? Hardly! But now they lie down under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20230">
     them, and even vote and fight to keep them! So, too, with this Air

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20240">
     Trust. Time will show you I'm right."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20260">
     Waldron glanced at his watch.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20280">
     "Long past lunch-time, Flint," said he. "Enough of this, for now. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20290">
     this afternoon, I've got that D.&amp;nbsp;K. &amp; E. directors' meeting on

     hand. When shall we go on with our plans, and get down to specific

     details?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20330">
     "This evening, say?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20350">
     "Very well. At my house?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20370">
     "No. Too noisy. Run out to Englewood, to mine. We'll be quiet there. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20380">
     come early, Waldron. We've no end of things to discuss. The quicker we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20390">
     get the actual work under way, now, the better. You can see Catherine,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20400">
     too. Isn't that an inducement?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20420">
     Thus ended the conference. It resumed, that night, in Flint's luxurious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20430">
     study at "Idle Hour," his superb estate on the Palisades. Waldron paid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20440">
     only a perfunctory court to Catherine, who manifested her pleasure by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20450">
     studied indifference. Both magnates felt relieved when she withdrew.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20460">
     They had other and larger matters under way than any dealing with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20470">
     amenities of life.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20490">
     Until past midnight the session in the study lasted, under the soft glow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20500">
     of the Billionaire's reading-light. And many choice cigars were smoked,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20510">
     many sheets of paper covered with diagrams and calculations, many vast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20520">
     schemes of conquest expanded, ere the two masters said good-night and

     separated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20550">
     At the very hour of Waldron's leave-taking, another man was pondering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20560">
     deeply, studying the problem from quite another angle, and--no less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20570">
     earnestly, than the two magnates--laying careful plans.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20590">
     This man, sturdy, well-built and keen, smoked an old briar as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20600">
     worked. A flannel shirt, open at the throat, showed a well-sinewed neck

     and powerful chest. Under the inverted cone of a shaded incandescent in

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20640">
     crease his high and prominent brow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20660">
     From time to time he gazed out through the open window, off toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20670">
     whispering lines of surf on the eastern shores of Staten Island--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20680">
     surf forever talking, forever striving to give its mystic message to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20690">
     unheeding ear of man. And as he gazed, his blue eyes narrowed with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20700">
     intensity of his thought. Once, as though some sudden understanding had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20710">
     come to him, he smote the pine table with a corded fist, and swore below
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20720">
     his breath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20740">
     It was past two in the morning when he finally rose, stretched, yawned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20750">
     and made ready for sleep on his hard iron bunk.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20770">
     "Can it be?" he muttered, as he undressed. "Can it be possible, or am I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20780">
     dreaming? No--this is no dream! This is reality; and thank God, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20790">
     understand."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20810">
     Then, before he extinguished his light, he took from the table the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20820">
     material he had been studying over, and put it beneath his pillow, where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20830">
     he could guard it safe till morning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20850">
     The thing he thus protected was none other than a small note-book,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_20860">
     filled with diagrams, jottings and calculations, and bound in red

     Almost all the following morning, working at his bench in the

     The finding of that little red-leather note-book, he fully understood,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21070">
     had at one stroke put him in possession of facts more vital to the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21080">
     labor-movement and the world at large than any which had ever developed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21090">
     since the very beginning of Capitalism. A Socialist to the backbone,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21100">
     thoroughly class-conscious and dowered with an incisive intellect,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21110">
     Gabriel thrilled at thought that he, by chance, had been chosen as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21120">
     instrument through which he felt the final revolution now must work. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21130">
     though he remained outwardly calm, as he bent above his toil, inwardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21140">
     he was aflame. His heart throbbed with an excitement he could scarce
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21150">
     control. His brain seemed on fire; his soul pulsed with savage joy and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21160">
     magnificent inspiration. For he was only four-and-twenty, and the bitter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21170">
     grind of years and toil had not yet worn his spirit down nor quelled the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21180">
     ardor of his splendid strength and optimism.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21200">
     Working at his routine labor, his mind was not upon it. No, rather it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21210">
     dwelt upon the vast discovery he had made--or seemed to have made--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21220">
     night before. Clearly limned before his vision, he still saw the notes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21230">
     the plans, the calculations he had been able to decipher in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21240">
     Billionaire's lost note-book--the note-book which now, deep in the

     pocket of his jumper that hung behind him on a hook against the wall,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21260">
     drew his every thought, as steel draws the compass-needle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21280">
     "Incredible, yet true!" he pondered, as he filed a brass casting for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21290">
     new-type dynamo. "These men are plotting to strangle the world to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21300">
     death--to strangle, if they cannot own and rule it! And, what's more, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21310">
     see nothing to prevent their doing it. The plan is sound. They have the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21320">
     means. At this very moment, the whole human race is standing in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21330">
     shadow of a peril so great, a slavery so imminent, that the most savage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21340">
     war of conquest ever waged would be a mere skirmish, by comparison!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21360">
     Mechanically he labored on and on, turning the tremendous problem in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21370">
     brain, striving in vain for some solution, some grasp at effective
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21380">
     opposition. And, as he thought, a kind of dumb hopelessness settled down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21390">
     about him, tangible almost as a curtain black and heavy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21410">
     "What shall I do?" he muttered to himself. "What can I do, to strike
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21420">
     these devils from their villainous plan of mastery?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21440">
     As yet, he saw nothing clearly. No way seemed open to him. Alone, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21450">
     knew he could do nothing; yet whither should he turn for help? To rival
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21460">
     capitalist groups? They would not even listen to him; or, if they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21470">
     listened and believed, they would only combine with the plotters, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21480">
     else, on their own hook, try to emulate them. To the labor movement? It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21490">
     would mock him as a chimerical dreamer, despite all his proofs. At best,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21500">
     he might start a few ineffectual strikes, petty and futile, indeed,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21510">
     against this vast, on-moving power. To the Socialists? They, through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21520">
     their press and speakers--in case they should believe him and co-operate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21530">
     with him--could, indeed, give the matter vast publicity and excite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21540">
     popular opposition; but, after all, could they abort the plan? He feared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21550">
     they could not. The time, he knew, was not yet ripe when Labor, on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21560">
     political field, could meet and overthrow forces such as these.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21580">
     And so, for all his fevered thinking, he got no radical, no practical
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21590">
     solution of the terrible problem. More and more definitely, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21600">
     weighed the pros and cons, the belief was borne in upon him that in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21610">
     case he must appeal to nobody but himself, count on nobody, trust in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21620">
     nobody save Gabriel Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21640">
     "I must play a lone hand game, for a while at least," he concluded, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21650">
     he finished his casting and took another. "Later, perhaps, I can enlist
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21660">
     my comrades. But for now, I must watch, wait, work, all alone. Perhaps,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21670">
     armed with this knowledge--invaluable knowledge shared by no one--I can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21680">
     meet their moves, checkmate their plans and defeat their ends. Perhaps!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21690">
     It will be a battle between one man, obscure and without means, and two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21700">
     men who hold billions of dollars and unlimited resources in their grasp.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21710">
     A battle unequal in every sense; a battle to the death. But I may win,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21720">
     after all. Every probability is that I shall lose, lose everything, even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21730">
     my life. Yet still, there is a chance. By God, I'll take it!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21750">
     The last words, uttered aloud, seemed to spring from his lips as though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21760">
     uttered by the very power of invincible determination. A sneer, behind
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21770">
     him, brought him round with a start. His gaze widened, at sight of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21780">
     Herzog standing there, cold and dangerous looking, with a venomous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21790">
     expression in those ill-mated eyes of his.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21810">
     "Take it, will you?" jibed the scientist. "You thief!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21830">
     Gabriel sprang up so suddenly that his stool clattered over backward on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21840">
     the red-tiled floor. His big fist clenched and lifted. But Herzog never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21850">
     flinched.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21870">
     "Thief!" he repeated, with an ugly thrust of the jaw. Servile and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21880">
     crawling to his masters, the man was ever arrogant and harsh with those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21890">
     beneath his authority. "I repeat the word. Drop that fist, Armstrong, if
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21900">
     you know what's good for you. I warn you. Any disturbance, here,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21910">
     and--well, you know what we can do!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21930">
     The electrician paled, slightly. But it was not through cowardice. Rage,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21940">
     passion unspeakable, a sudden and animal hate of this lick-spittle and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21950">
     supine toady shook him to the heart's core. Yet he managed to control
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21960">
     himself, not through any personal apprehension, but because of the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21970">
     work he knew still lay before him. At all hazards, come what might, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21980">
     must stay on, there, at the Oakwood Heights plant. Nothing, now, must
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_21990">
     come between him and that one supreme labor.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22010">
     Thus he controlled himself, with an effort so tremendous that it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22020">
     wrenched his very soul. This trouble, whatever it might be, must not be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22030">
     noised about. Already, up and down the shop, workers were peering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22040">
     curiously at him. He must be calm; must pass the insult, smooth the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22050">
     situation and remain employed there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22070">
     "I--I beg pardon," he managed to articulate, with pale lips that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22080">
     trembled. He wiped the beaded sweat from his broad forehead. "Excuse me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22090">
     Mr. Herzog. I--you startled me. What's the trouble? Any complaint to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22100">
     make? If so, I'm here to listen."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22120">
     Herzog's teeth showed in a rat-like grin of malice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22140">
     "Yes, you'll listen, all right enough," he sneered. "I've named you, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22150">
     that goes! You're a thief, Armstrong, and this proves it! Look!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22170">
     From behind his back, where he had been holding it, he produced the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22180">
     little morocco-covered book. Right in Armstrong's face he shook it, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22190">
     an oath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22210">
     "Steal, will you?" he jibed. "For it's the same thing--no difference
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22220">
     whether you picked it out of Mr. Flint's pocket or found it on the floor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22230">
     here, and tried to keep it! Steal, eh? Hold it for some possible reward?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22240">
     You skunk! Lucky you haven't brains enough to make out what's in it!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22250">
     Thought you'd keep it, did you? But you weren't smart enough,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22260">
     Armstrong--no, not quite smart enough for me! After looking the whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22270">
     place over, I thought I'd have a go at a few pockets--and, you see? Oh,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22280">
     you'll have to get up early to beat _me_ at the game you--you thief!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22300">
     With the last word, he raised the book and struck the young man a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22310">
     blistering welt across the face with it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22330">
     Armstrong fell back, against the bench, perfectly livid, with the wale
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22340">
     of the blow standing out red and distinct across his cheek. Then he went
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22350">
     pale as death, and staggered as though about to faint.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22370">
     "God--God in heaven!" he gasped. "Give me--strength--not to kill this

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22380">
     animal!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22400">
     A startled look came into Herzog's face. He recognized, at last, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22410">
     nature of the rage he had awakened. In those twitching fists and that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22420">
     white, writhen face he recognized the signs of passion that might, on a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22440">
     retreated, like the coward he was, though with the sneer still on his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22450">
     thin and cruel lips.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22470">
     "Get your time!" he commanded, with crude brutality. "Go, get it at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22480">
     once. You're lucky to get off so easily. If Flint knew this, you'd land
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22490">
     behind bars. But we want no scenes here. Get your money from Sanderson,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22500">
     and clear out. Your job ended the minute my hand touched that book in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22510">
     your pocket!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22530">
     Still Armstrong made no reply. Still he remained there, dazed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22540">
     stricken, pallid as milk, a wild and terrible light in his blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22560">
     An ugly murmur rose. Two or three of his fellow-workmen had come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22570">
     drifting down the shop, toward the scene of altercation. Another joined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22580">
     them, and another. Not one of them but hated Herzog with a bitter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22590">
     animosity. And now perhaps, the time was come to pay a score or two.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22610">
     But Armstrong, suddenly lifting his head, faced them all, his comrades.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22620">
     His mind, quick-acting, had realized that, now his possession of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22630">
     book had been discovered, his chances of discovering anything more, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22640">
     the works, had utterly vanished. Even though he should remain, he could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22650">
     do nothing there. If he were to act, it must be from the outside, now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22660">
     following the trend of events, dogging each development, striving in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22670">
     hidden, devious ways--violent ways, perhaps--to pull down this horrible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22680">
     edifice of enslavement ere it should whelm and crush the world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22700">
     So, acting as quickly as he had thought, and now ignoring the man Herzog
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22710">
     as though he had never existed, Armstrong faced his fellows.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22730">
     "It's all right, boys," said he, quite slowly, his voice seeming to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22740">
     come from a distance, his tones forced and unnatural. "It's all right,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22750">
     every way. I'm caught with the goods. Don't any of you butt in. Don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22760">
     mix with my trouble. For once I'm glad this is a scab shop, otherwise
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22770">
     there might be a strike, here, and worse Hell to pay than there will be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22780">
     otherwise. I'm done. I'll get my time, and quit. But--remember one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22790">
     thing, you'll understand some day what this is all about.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22810">
     "I'm glad to have worked with you fellows, the past few months. You're
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22820">
     all right, every one of you. Good-bye, and remember--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22840">
     "Here, you men, get back to work!" cried Herzog, suddenly. "No
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22850">
     hand-shaking here, and no speech-making. This man's a sneak-thief and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22860">
     he's fired, that's all there is to it. Now, get onto your job! The first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22870">
     man that puts up a complaint about it, can get through, too!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22890">
     For a moment they glowered at him, there in the white-lighted glare of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22900">
     the big shop. A fight, even then, was perilously near, but Armstrong
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22910">
     averted it by turning away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22930">
     "I'm done." he repeated. He gathered up a few tools that belonged to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22940">
     him, personally, gave one look at his comrades, waved a hand at them,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22950">
     and then, followed by Herzog, strode off down the long aisle, toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22960">
     door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_22980">
     "Herzog," said he, calmly and with cold emphasis, "listen to this."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23000">
     "Get out! Get your time, I tell you, and go!" repeated the bully. "To
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23010">
     Hell with you! Clear out of here!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23030">
     "I'm going," the young man answered. "But before I do, remember this;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23040">
     you grazed death, just now. Well for you, Herzog, almighty well for you,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23050">
     my temper didn't best me. For remember, you struck me and called me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23060">
     'thief'--and that sort of thing can't be forgotten, ever, even though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23070">
     we live a thousand years.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23090">
     "Remember, Herzog--not now, but sometime. Remember that one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23100">
     word--sometime! That's all!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23120">
     With no further speech, and while Herzog still stood there by the shop
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23130">
     door, sneering at him, Armstrong turned and passed out. A few minutes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23140">
     later he had been paid off, had packed his knapsack with his few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23150">
     belongings, and was outside the big palisade, striding along the hard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23160">
     and glaring road toward the station.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23180">
     "I did it," his one overmastering thought was. "Thank heaven, I did it!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23190">
     I held my temper and my tongue, didn't kill that spawn of Hell, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23200">
     saved the whole situation. I'm out of a job, true enough, and out of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23210">
     plant; but after all, I'm free--and I know what's in the wind!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23230">
     "There's yet hope. There'll be a way, a way to do this work! What a man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23240">
     _must_ do, he _can_ do!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23260">
     Up came Armstrong's chin, as he walked. His shoulders squared, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23270">
     strength and purpose, and his stride swung into the easy machine gait
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23280">
     that had already carried him so many thousand miles along the hard and
    </p>

     bitter highways of the world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23310">
     As he strode away, on the long road toward he knew not what, words
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23320">
     seemed to form and shape in his strengthened and refortified mind--words
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_23330">
     for long years forgotten--words that he once had heard at his mother's

     Armstrong's abrupt dismissal, was a scene of gaiety and beauty without

     At one of the tables, obviously bored, sat Catherine Flint, only

     coiled and braided masses of coppery hair that circled her shapely head.

     A healthy tan on face and arms and open throat bespoke her keen devotion

     Impatience dominated her. One could see that, in the nervous tapping of

     there, one knee crossed over the other; the glance of her keen, gray

     glanced impatiently at the long bag of golf-sticks leaning against the

     set in a leather wristlet on her arm.

     "Inconsiderate of him, I'm sure--ah--to keep so magnificent a Diana

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24240">
     services as your knight-errant, and all that sort of thing."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24260">
     "Thanks, awfully," she answered, "but Mr. Waldron promised to go round
    </p>

     the course with me, this afternoon, and I'll wait."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24290">
     The impeccable one grinned fatuously, invited her again to have a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24300">
     drink--which she declined--and ordered another for himself, with profuse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24310">
     apologies for drinking alone; apologies which she hardly seemed to

     notice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24340">
     "Deuced bad form of Wally, I must say," the gilded youth resumed, trying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24350">
     to make capital for himself, "to leave you in the lurch, this way!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24370">
     Silence from Catherine. The would-be interloper, feeling that he was on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24380">
     the wrong track, took counsel with himself and remained for a moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24390">
     immersed in what he imagined to be thought. At last, however, with an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24400">
     oblique glance at his indifferent companion, he remarked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24420">
     "Devilish hard time women have in this world, you know! Don't you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24430">
     sometimes wish you were a man?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24450">
     Her answer flashed back like a rapier:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24470">
     "No! Do you wish _you_ were?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24490">
     Stunned by this "facer," Reginald Van Slyke gasped and stared. That he,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24500">
     a scion of the Philadelphia Van Slykes, in his own right worth two

     hundred million dollars--dollars ground out of the Kensington
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24520">
     carpet-mill slaves by his grandfather--should be thus flouted and put
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24530">
     upon by the daughter of Flint, that parvenu, absolutely floored him. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24540">
     a moment he sat there speechless, unable even to reach for his drink;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24550">
     but presently some coherence returned. He was about to utter what he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24560">
     conceived to be a strong rejoinder, when the girl suddenly standing up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24570">
     turned her back upon him and ignored him as completely as she might have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24580">
     ignored any of the menials of the club.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24600">
     His irritated glance followed hers. There, far down the drive, just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24610">
     rounding the long turn by the artificial lake, a big blue motor car was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24620">
     speeding up the grade at a good clip. Van Slyke recognized it, and swore
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24630">
     below his breath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24650">
     "Wally, at last, damn him!" he muttered. "Just when I was beginning to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24660">
     make headway with Kate!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24680">
     Vexed beyond endurance, he drummed on the cloth with angry fingers; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24690">
     Catherine was oblivious. Unmindful of the merry-makers at the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24700">
     tables, the girl waved her handkerchief at the swiftly-approaching
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24710">
     motor. Waldron, from the back seat, raised an answering hand--though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24720">
     without enthusiasm. Above all things he hated demonstration, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24730">
     girl's frank manner, free, unconventional and not yet broken to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24740">
     harness of Mrs. Grundy, never failed to irritate him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24760">
     "Very incorrect for people in our set," he often thought. "But for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24770">
     present I can do nothing. Once she is my wife, ah, then I shall find
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24780">
     means to curb her. For the present, however, I must let her have her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24790">
     head."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24810">
     Such was now his frame of mind as the long car slid under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24820">
     porte-cochÃ¨re and came to a stand. He would have infinitely preferred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24830">
     that the girl should wait his coming to her, on the piazza; but already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24840">
     she had slung her bag of sticks over her strong shoulder, and was down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24850">
     the steps to meet him. Her leave-taking of the incensed Van Slyke had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24860">
     been the merest nod.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24880">
     "You're late, Wally," said she, smiling with her usual good humor, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24890">
     had already quite dissipated her impatience. "Late, but I'll forgive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24900">
     you, this time. I'm afraid we won't have time to do all eighteen holes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24910">
     round. What kept you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24930">
     "Business, business!" he answered, frowning. "Always the same old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24940">
     grind, Kate. You women don't understand. I tell you, this slaving in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24950">
     Wall Street isn't what it's cracked up to be. I couldn't get away till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24960">
     11:30. Then, just had a quick bite of lunch, and broke every speed law
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24970">
     in New York getting here. Do you forgive me?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_24990">
     He had descended from the car, in speaking. They shook hands, while the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25000">
     chauffeur stood at attention and all the gossips on the piazza, scenting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25010">
     the possibility of a disagreement, craned discreetly eager necks and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25020">
     listened intently.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25040">
     "Forgive you? Of course--this time, but never again," the girl laughed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25050">
     "Now, run along and get into your flannels. I'll meet you on the driving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25060">
     green, in ten minutes. Not another second, mind, or--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25080">
     "I'll be on the dot," he answered. "Here, boy," beckoning a caddy, "take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25090">
     Miss Flint's sticks. And have mine carried to the green. Look sharp,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25100">
     now!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25120">
     Then, with a nod at the girl, he ran up the steps and vanished in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25130">
     club-house, bound for the locker-room.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25150">
     Fifteen minutes the girl waited on the green, watching others drive off
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25160">
     from the little tees and inwardly chafing to be in action. Fifteen, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25170">
     then twenty, before Waldron finally appeared, immaculate in white,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25180">
     bare-armed and with a loose, checked cap shading his close-set eyes. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25190">
     fact was, in addition to having changed his clothes, he had felt obliged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25200">
     to linger in the bar for a little Scotch; and one drink had meant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25210">
     another; and thus precious moments had sped.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25230">
     But his smile was confident as he approached the green. Women, after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25240">
     all, he reflected, were meant to be kept waiting. They never appreciated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25250">
     a man who kept appointments exactly. Not less fatuous at heart, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25260">
     truth, was he, than the unfortunate Van Slyke. But his manner was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25270">
     perfection as he saluted her and bade the caddy build their tees.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25290">
     The girl, however, was now plainly vexed. Her mouth had drawn a trifle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25300">
     tight and the tilt of her chin was determined. Her eyes were far from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25310">
     soft, as she surveyed this delinquent fiancÃ©.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25330">
     "I don't like you a bit, today, Wally," said she, as he deliberated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25340">
     over the club-bag, choosing a driver. "This makes twice you've kept me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25350">
     waiting. I warn you don't let it happen again!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25370">
     Under the seeming banter of her tone lurked real resentment. But he,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25380">
     with a smile--partly due to a finger too much Scotch--only answered, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25390">
     a low tone:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25410">
     "You're adorable, today, Kate! The combination of fresh air and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25420">
     annoyance has painted the most wonderful roses on your cheeks!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25440">
     She shrugged her shoulders with a little motion she had inherited from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25450">
     French ancestry, stooped, set her golf ball on the little mound of sand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25460">
     exactly to suit her, and raised her driver on high.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25480">
     "Nine holes," said she, "and I'm going to beat you, today!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25500">
     He frowned a little at the spirit of the threat, for any self-assertion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25510">
     in a woman crossed his grain; but soon forgot his pique in admiration of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25520">
     the drive.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25540">
     Swishing, her club flashed down in a quick circle. _Crack_! It struck
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25550">
     the gutta-percha squarely. The little white sphere zipped away like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25560">
     rocket, rose in a far trajectory, up, up, toward the water-hazard at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25570">
     foot of the grassy slope, then down in a long curve.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25590">
     Even while the girl's cry of "Fore!" was echoing across the green, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25600">
     ball struck earth, ricochetted and sped on, away, across the turf, till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25610">
     it came to rest not twenty yards from the putting green of the first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25620">
     hole.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25640">
     "Wheeoo!" whistled Waldron. "Some drive. I guess you're going to make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25650">
     good your threat, today, Kate of my heart!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25670">
     The smile she flashed at him showed that her resentment had, for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25680">
     moment, been forgotten.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25700">
     "Come on, Wally, now let's see what _you_ can do," said she, starting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25710">
     off down the slope, while her meek caddy tagged at a respectful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25720">
     distance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25740">
     Waldron, thus adjured, teed up and swung at the ball. But the Scotch had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25750">
     by no means steadied his aim. He foozled badly and broke his pet driver,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25760">
     into the bargain. The steel head of it flew farther even than the ball,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25770">
     which moved hardly ten yards.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25790">
     "Damn!" he muttered, under his breath, choosing another stick and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25800">
     glancing with real irritation at Catherine's lithe, splendidly poised
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25810">
     figure already some distance down the slope.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25830">
     His second stroke was more successful, nearly equalling hers. But her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25840">
     advantage, thus early won, was not destined to be lost again. And as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25850">
     game proceeded, Waldron's temper grew steadily worse and worse.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25870">
     Thus began, for these two people, an hour destined to be fraught with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_25880">
     such pregnant developments--an hour which, in its own way, vitally bore

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26050">
     Waldron, heated by exercise and the whiskey he had drunk, had already

     dismissed the caddies and had undertaken to carry the clubs, himself,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26120">
     and fell into the tinned hole, the man ejaculated a perfectly audible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26130">
     "_Hell!_"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26150">
     She stood erect and faced him, with a singular expression in those level
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26160">
     gray eyes--eyes the look of which could allure or wither, could entice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26170">
     or command.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26190">
     "Wally," said she, "did you swear?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26210">
     "I--er--why, yes," he stammered, taken aback and realizing, despite his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26220">
     chagrin, how very poor and unsportsmanlike a figure he was cutting.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26240">
     "I don't like it," she returned. "Not a little bit, Wally. It isn't

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26250">
     game, and it isn't manly. You must respect me, now and always. I can't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26260">
     have profanity, and I won't."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26280">
     He essayed lame apologies, but a sudden, hot anger seemed to have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26290">
     possessed him, in presence of this free, independent, exacting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26300">
     woman--this woman who, worst of all, had just beaten him at the game of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26310">
     all games he prided himself on playing well. And despite his every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26320">
     effort, she saw through the veil of sheer, perfunctory courtesy; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26330">
     seeing, flushed with indignation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26350">
     "Wally," she said in a low, quiet tone, fixing a singular gaze upon him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26360">
     "Wally, I don't know what to make of you lately. The other night at Idle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26370">
     Hour, you hardly looked at me. You and father spent the whole evening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26380">
     discussing some business or other--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26400">
     "Most important business, my dear girl, I do assure you," protested
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26410">
     Waldron, trying to steady his voice. "Most vitally--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26430">
     "No matter about that," she interposed. "It could have been abridged, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26440">
     trifle. I barely got six words out of you, that evening; and let me tell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26450">
     you, Wally, a woman never forgets neglect. She may forgive it; but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26460">
     forget it, never!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26480">
     "Oh, well, if you put it that way--" he began, but checked himself in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26490">
     time to suppress the cutting rejoinder he had at his tongue's end.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26510">
     "I do, and it's vital, Wally," she answered. "It's all part and parcel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26520">
     of some singular kind of change that's been coming over you, lately,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26530">
     like a blight. You haven't been yourself, at all, these few days past.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26540">
     Something or other, I don't know what, has been coming between us.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26550">
     You've got something else on your mind, beside me--something bigger and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26560">
     more important to you than I am--and--and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26580">
     He pulled out his gold cigar-case, chose and lighted a cigar to steady
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26590">
     his nerve, and faced her with a smile--the worst tactic he could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26600">
     possibly have chosen in dealing with this woman. Supremely successful in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26610">
     handling men, he lacked finesse and insight with the other sex; and now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26620">
     that lack, in his moment of need, was bringing him moment by moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26630">
     nearer the edge of catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26650">
     "I don't like it at all, Waldron," she resumed, again. "You were late,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26660">
     the other night, in taking me to the Flower Show. You were late, today,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26670">
     for our appointment here; and the ten minutes I gave you to get ready
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26680">
     in, stretched out to twenty before you--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26700">
     He interrupted her with a gesture of uncontrollable vexation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26720">
     "Really, my dear Kate," he exclaimed, "if you--er--insist on holding me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26730">
     to account for every moment--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26750">
     "You've been drinking, too, a little," she kept on. "And you know I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26760">
     detest it! And just now, when I beat you in a square game, you so far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26770">
     forgot yourself as to swear. Now, Waldron--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26790">
     "Oh, puritanical, eh?" he sneered, ignoring the danger signals in her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26800">
     eyes. Even yet there might have been some chance of avoiding shipwreck,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26810">
     had he heeded those twin beacons, humbled himself, made amends by due
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26820">
     apology and promised reformation. For though Catherine never had truly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26830">
     loved this man, some years older than herself and of radically different
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26840">
     character, still she liked and respected him, and found him--by his very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26850">
     force and dominance--far more to her taste than the insipid hangers-on,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26860">
     sons of fortune or fortune-hunters, who, like the sap-brained Van
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26870">
     Slyke, made up so great a part of her "set."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26890">
     So, all might yet have been amended; but this was not to be. Never yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26900">
     had "Tiger" Waldron bowed the neck to living man or woman. Dominance was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26910">
     his whole scheme of life. Though he might purr, politely enough, so long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26920">
     as his fur was smoothed the right way, a single backward stroke set his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26930">
     fangs gleaming and unsheathed every sabre-like claw. And now this woman,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26940">
     his fiancÃ©e though she was, her beauty dear to him and her charm most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26950">
     fascinating, her fortune much desired and most of all, an alliance with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26960">
     her father--now this woman, despite all these considerations, had with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26970">
     few incisive words ruffled his temper beyond endurance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_26990">
     So great was his agitation that, despite his strongest instinct of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27000">
     saving, he flung away the scarcely-tasted cigar.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27020">
     "Kate," he exclaimed, his very tongue thick with the rage he could not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27030">
     quell, "Kate, I can't stand this! You're going too far. What do you know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27040">
     of men's work and men's affairs? Who are you, to judge of their times of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27050">
     coming and going, their obligations, their habits and man of life? What
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27060">
     do _you_ understand--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27080">
     "It's obvious," she replied with glacial coldness, "that I don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27090">
     understand _you_, and never have. I have been living in a dream, Wally;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27100">
     seeing you through the glass of illusion; not reality. After all, you're
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27110">
     like all men--just the same, no different. Idealism, self-sacrifice, con
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27120">
     true nobility of character, where are these, in you? What is there but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27130">
     the same old selfishness, the same innate masculine conceit and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27150">
     "No more of this, Kate!" cried the financier, paling a little. "No more!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27160">
     I can't have it! I won't--it's impossible! You--you don't understand, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27170">
     tell you. In your narrow, untrained, woman's way, you try to set up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27180">
     standards for me; try to judge me, and dictate to me. Some old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27190">
     puritanical streak in you is cropping out, some blue-law atavism, some I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27200">
     know not what, that rebels against my taking a drink--like every other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27210">
     man. That cries out against my letting slip a harmless oath--again, like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27220">
     every other man that lives and breathes. Every man, that is, who _is_ a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27230">
     man, a real man, not a dummy! If you've been mistaken in me, how much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27240">
     more have I, in you! And so--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27260">
     "And so," she took the very words from his pale lips, "we've both been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27270">
     mistaken, that's all. No, no," she forbade him with raised hand, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27280">
     would have interrupted with protests. "No, you needn't try to convince
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27290">
     me otherwise, now. A thousand volumes of speeches, after this, couldn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27300">
     do it. An hour's insight into the true depths of a man's character--yes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27310">
     even a moment's--perfectly suffices to show the truth. You've just drawn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27320">
     the veil aside, Wally, for me, and let me look at the true picture. All
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27330">
     that I've known and thought of you, so far, has been sham and illusion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27340">
     Now, I _know_ you!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27360">
     "You--you don't, Catherine!" he exclaimed, half in anger, half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27370">
     contrition, terrified at last by the imminent break between them, by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27380">
     thought of losing this rich flower from the garden of womanhood, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27390">
     splendid financial and social prize. "I--I've done wrong, Kate. I admit
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27400">
     it. But, truly--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27420">
     "No more," said she, and in her voice sounded a command he knew, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27430">
     last, was quite inexorable. "I'm not like other women of our set,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27440">
     perhaps. I can't be bought and sold, Wally, with money and position. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27450">
     can't marry a man, and have to live with him, if he shows himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27460">
     petty, or small, or narrow in any way. I must be free, free as air, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27470">
     long as I live. Even in marriage, I must be free. Freedom can only come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27480">
     with the union of two souls that understand and help and inspire each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27490">
     other. Anything else is slavery--and worse!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27510">
     She shuddered, and for a moment turned half away from him, as, now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27520">
     contrite enough for the minute, he stood there looking at her with dazed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27530">
     eyes. For a second the idea came to him that he must take her in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27540">
     arms, there in the edge of the woods, burn kisses on her ripe mouth, win
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27550">
     her back to him by force, as he had won all life's battles. He would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27560">
     not, could not, let this prize escape him now. A wave of desire surged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27570">
     through his being. He took a step toward her, his trembling arms open to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27580">
     seize her lithe, seductive body. But she, retreating, held him away with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27590">
     repellant palms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27610">
     "No, no, no!" she cried. "Not now--never that, any more! I must be free,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27620">
     Wally--free as air!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27640">
     She raised her face toward the vast reaches of the sky, breathed deep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27650">
     and for a moment closed her eyes, as though bathing her very soul in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27660">
     sweet freedom of the out-of-doors.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27680">
     "Free as air!" she whispered. "Let me go!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27700">
     He started violently. Her simile had struck him like a lash.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27720">
     "Free--as what?" he exclaimed hoarsely. "As _air_? But--but there's no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27730">
     such freedom, I tell you! Air isn't free any more--or won't be, soon! It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27740">
     will be everything, anything but free, before another year is gone! Free
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27750">
     as air? You--you don't understand! Your father and I--we shall soon own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27760">
     the air. Free as air? Yes, if you like! For that--that means you, too,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27770">
     must belong to me!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27790">
     Again he sought to take her, to hold her and overmaster her. But she,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27800">
     now wide-eyed with a kind of sudden terror at this latest outbreak, this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27810">
     seeming madness on his part, which she could nowise fathom or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27820">
     comprehend, retreated ever more and more, away from him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_27840">
     Then suddenly with a quick effort, she stripped off the splendid,

     mastered it before he had reached the Oakwood Heights station--he began
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28450">
     philosophically to turn the situation in his mind, and to rough out his
    </p>

     plans for the future.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28480">
     "Things might be worse, all round," he reflected, as he strode along at

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28490">
     a smart pace. "During the seven months I've been working for these

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28500">
     pirates, I've managed to pay off the debt I got into at the time of the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28530">
     blacklists me all over the country, as he probably will, I can duck into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28540">
     some job or other, somewhere. And most important of all, I know what's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28550">
     due to happen in America--I've seen that note-book! Let them do what
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28560">
     they will, they can't take _that_ knowledge away from me!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28580">
     The outlook, on the whole, was cheering. Gabriel broke into a whistle,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28590">
     as he swung along the highway, and slashed cheerfully with his heavy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28600">
     stick at the dusty bushes by the roadside. A vigorous, pleasing figure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28610">
     of a man he made, striding onward in his blue flannel shirt and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28620">
     corduroys, stout boots making light of distance, somewhat rebellious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28630">
     black hair clustering under his cap, blue eyes clear and steady as the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28640">
     sunlight itself. There must have been a drop of Irish blood somewhere or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28650">
     other in his veins, to have given him that ruddy cheek, those eyes, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28660">
     hair, that quick enthusiasm and that swiftness to anger--then, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28670">
     reaction, that quick buoyancy which so soon banished everything but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28680">
     courageous optimism from his hot heart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28700">
     Thus the man walked, all his few worldly belongings--most precious among
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28710">
     them his union card and his red Socialist card--packed in the knapsack
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28720">
     strapped to his broad shoulders. And as he walked, he formulated his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28730">
     plans.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28750">
     "Niagara for mine," he decided. "It's there these hellions mean to start
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28760">
     their devilish work of enslaving the whole world. It's there I want to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28770">
     be, and must be, to follow the infernal job from the beginning and to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28780">
     nail it, when the right time comes. I'll put in a day or two with my old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28790">
     friend, Sam Underwood, up in the Bronx, and maybe tell him what's doing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28800">
     and frame out the line of action with him. But after that, I strike for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28810">
     Niagara--yes, and on foot!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28830">
     This decision came to him as strongly desirable. Not for some time, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28840">
     knew, could the actual work of building the Air Trust plant be started
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28850">
     at Niagara. Meanwhile, he wanted to keep out of sight, as much as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28860">
     possible. He wanted, also to save every cent. Again, his usual mode of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28870">
     travel had always been either to ride the rods or "hike" it on shanks'

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28880">
     mare. Bitterly opposed to swelling the railways' revenues by even a

     penny, Armstrong in the past few years of his life had done some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28900">
     thousands of miles, afoot, all over the country. His best means of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28910">
     Socialist propaganda, he had found, was in just such meanderings along
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28920">
     the highways and hedges of existence--a casual job, here or there, for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28930">
     day, a week, a month--then, quick friendships; a little talk; a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28940">
     leaflets handed to the intelligent, if he could find any. He had laced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28950">
     the continent with such peregrinations, always sowing the seed of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28960">
     revolution wherever he had passed; getting in touch with the Movement
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28970">
     all over the republic; keeping his finger on the pulse of ever-growing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_28980">
     always-strengthening Socialism.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29000">
     Such had his habits long been. And now, once more adrift and jobless,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29010">
     but with the most tremendous secret of the ages in his possession, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29020">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29590">
     the club-house. Head well up, and eyes defiant, she walked up the broad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29600">
     steps and into the office. Little cared she whether the piazza
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29610">
     gossips--The Hammer and Anvil Club, in local slang--divined the quarrel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29620">
     or not. The girl felt herself immeasurably indifferent to such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29630">
     pettinesses as prying small talk and innuendo. Let people know, or not,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29640">
     as might be, she cared not a whit. Her business was her own. No wagging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29650">
     of tongues could one hair's breadth disturb that splendid calm of hers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29670">
     The clerk, behind the desk, smiled and nodded at her approach.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29690">
     "Please have my car brought round to the porte-cochÃ¨re, at once?" she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29700">
     asked. "And tell Herrick to be sure there's plenty of gas for a long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29710">
     run. I'm going through to New York."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29730">
     "So soon?" queried the clerk. "I'm sure your father will be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29740">
     disappointed, Miss Flint. He's just wired that he's coming out tomorrow,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29750">
     to spend Sunday here. He particularly asks to have you remain. See
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29760">
     here?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29780">
     He handed her a telegram. She glanced it over, then crumpled it and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29790">
     tossed it into the office fire-place.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29810">
     "I'm sorry," she answered. "But I can't stay. I must get back, to-night.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29820">
     I'll telegraph father not to come. A blank, please?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29840">
     The clerk handed her one. She pondered a second, then wrote:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29860">
     Dear Father: A change of plans makes me return home at once.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29870">
     Please wait and see me there. I've something important to talk over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29880">
     with you.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29900">
     Affectionately,

     Ordinarily people try to squeeze their message to ten words, and count
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29950">
     and prune and count again; but not so, Catherine. For her, a telegram
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29960">
     had never contained any space limit. It meant less to her than a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29970">
     post-card to you or me. Not that the girl was consciously extravagant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29980">
     No, had you asked her, she would have claimed rigid economy--she rarely,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_29990">
     for instance, paid more than a hundred dollars for a morning gown, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30000">
     more than a thousand for a ball-dress. It was simply that the idea of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30010">
     counting words had never yet occurred to her. And so now, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30020">
     complacently handed this verbose message to the clerk, who--thoroughly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30030">
     well-trained--understood it was to be charged on her father's perfectly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30040">
     staggering monthly bill.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30060">
     "Very well, Miss Flint," said he. "I'll send this at once. And your car
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30070">
     will be ready for you in ten minutes--or five, if you like?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30090">
     "Ten will do, thank you," she answered. Then she crossed to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30100">
     elevator and went up to her own suite of rooms on the second floor, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30110">
     her motor-coat and veils.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30130">
     "Free, thank heaven!" she breathed, with infinite relief, as she stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30140">
     before the tall mirror, adjusting these for the long trip. "Free from

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30150">
     that man forever. What a narrow escape! If things hadn't happened just

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30160">
     as they did, and if I hadn't had that precious insight into Wally's

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30170">
     character--good Lord!--catastrophe! Oh, I haven't been so happy since

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30180">
     I--since--why, I've _never_ been so happy in all my life!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30200">
     "Wally, dear boy," she added, turning toward the window as though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30210">
     apostrophizing him in reality, "now we can be good friends. Now all the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30230">
     splendid. As a husband--oh, impossible!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30250">
     Lighter of heart than she had been for years, was she, with the added

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30260">
     zest of the long spin through the beauty of the June country before

     her--down among the hills and cliffs, among the forests and broad

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30280">
     valleys--down to New York again, back to the father and the home she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30290">
     loved better than all else in the world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30310">
     In this happy frame of mind she presently entered the low-hung,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30320">
     swift-motored car, settled herself on the luxurious cushions and said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30330">
     "Home, at once!" to Herrick.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30350">
     He nodded, but did not speak. He felt, in truth, somewhat incapable of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30360">
     quite incoherent speech. Not having expected any service till next day,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30370">
     he had foregathered with others of his ilk in the servants' bar,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30380">
     below-stairs, and had with wassail and good cheer very effectively put
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30390">
     himself out of commission.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30410">
     But, somewhat sobered by this quick summons, he had managed to pull
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30420">
     together. Now, drunk though he was, he sat there at the wheel, steady
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30430">
     enough--so long as he held on to it--and only by the redness of his face
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30440">
     and a certain glassy look in his eye, betrayed the fact of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30450">
     intoxication. The girl, busy with her farewells as the car drew up for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30460">
     her, had not observed him. At the last moment Van Slyke waved a foppish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30470">
     hand at her, and smirked adieux. She acknowledged his good-bye with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30480">
     smile, so happy was she at the outcome of her golf-game; then cast a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30490">
     quick glance up at the club windows, fearing to see the harsh face of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30500">
     Wally peeping down at her in anger.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30520">
     But he was nowhere to be seen; and now, with a sudden acceleration of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30530">
     the powerful six-cylinder engine, the big gray car moved smoothly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30540">
     forward. Growling in its might, it swung in a wide circle round the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30550">
     sweep of the drive, gathered speed and shot away down the grade toward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30560">
     the stone gates of the entrance, a quarter mile distant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30580">
     Presently it swerved through these, to southward. Club-house, waving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30590">
     handkerchiefs and all vanished from Kate's view.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30610">
     "Faster, Herrick," she commanded, leaning forward, "I must be home by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30620">
     half past five."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30640">
     Again he nodded, and notched spark and throttle down. The car, leaping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30650">
     like a wild creature, began to hum at a swift clip along the smooth,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30660">
     white road toward Newburgh on the Hudson.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30680">
     Thirty miles an hour the speedometer showed, then thirty-five and forty.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30690">
     Again the drunken chauffeur, still master of his machine despite the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30700">
     poison pulsing in his dazed brain, snicked the little levers further
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30710">
     down. Forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, the figures on the dial showed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30730">
     Now the exhaust ripped in a crackling staccato, like a machine gun, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30740">
     the chauffeur threw out the muffler. Behind, a long trail of dust rose,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30750">
     whirling in the air. Catherine, a sportswoman born, leaned back and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30760">
     smiled with keen pleasure, while her yellow veil, whipping sharply on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30770">
     the wind, let stray locks of that wonderful red-gold hair stream about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30780">
     her flushed face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30800">
     Thus she sped homeward, driven at a mad race by a man whose every sense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_30810">
     was numbed and stultified by alcohol--homeward, along a road up which,

     far, far away, another man, keen, sober and alert, was trudging with a

     knapsack on his broad back, swinging a stick and whistling cheerily as

     Dust and pebbles flew in the wake of the machine, as it gathered

     "Herrick!" she commanded sharply, leaning forward. "What's the matter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31440">
     with you? Obey me, do you hear? Not so fast!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31460">
     A whiff of alcoholic breath suddenly told her the truth. For a second
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31470">
     she sat there, as though petrified, with fear now for the first time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31480">
     clutching at her heart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31500">
     "Stop at once!" she cried, gripping the man by the collar of his livery.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31510">
     "You--you're drunk, Herrick! I--I'll have you discharged, at once, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31520">
     we get home. Stop, do you hear me? You're not fit to drive. I'll take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31530">
     the wheel myself!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31550">
     But Herrick, hopelessly under the influence of the poison, which had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31560">
     now produced its full effect, paid no heed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31580">
     "Y'--can't dri' _thish_ car!" he muttered, in maudlin accents. "Too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31590">
     big--too heavy for--hc!--woman! I--_I_ dri' it all right, drunk or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31600">
     sober! Good chauffeur--good car--I know thish car! You won't fire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31610">
     me--hc!--for takin' drink or two, huh? I drive you all ri'--drive you to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31620">
     New York or to--hc!--Hell! Same thing, no difference, ha! ha!--I--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31640">
     A sudden blaze of rage crimsoned the girl's face. In all her life she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31650">
     never had been thus spoken to. For a second she clenched her fist, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31660">
     though to strike down this sodden brute there in the seat before her--a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31670">
     feat she would have been quite capable of. But second thought convinced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31680">
     her of the peril of such an act. Ahead of them a long down-grade
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31690">
     stretched away, away, to a turn half-hidden under the arching greenery.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31700">
     As the car struck this slope, it leaped into ever greater speed; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31710">
     now, under the erratic guidance of the lolling wretch at the wheel, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31720">
     began to sway in long, unsteady curves, first toward one ditch, then the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31730">
     other.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31750">
     Another woman would have screamed; might even have tried to jump out.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31760">
     But Kate was not of the hysteric sort. More practical, she.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31780">
     "I've got to climb over into the front seat," she realized in a flash,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31790">
     "and shut off the current--cut the power off--stop the car!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31810">
     On the instant, she acted. But as she arose in the tonneau, Herrick,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31820">
     sensing her purpose, turned toward her in the sudden rage of complete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31830">
     intoxication.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31850">
     "Naw--naw y' don't!" he shouted, his face perfectly purple with fury
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31860">
     and drink. "No woman--he!--runs this old boat while I'm aboard, see? Go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31870">
     on, fire me! _I_ don't give--damn! But you don't run--car! Sit down! _I_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31880">
     run car--New York or Hell--no matter which! _I_--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31900">
     Hurtling down the slope like a runaway comet, now wholly out of control,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31910">
     the powerful gray car leaped madly at the turn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31930">
     Catherine, her heart sick at last with terror, caught a second's glimpse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31940">
     of forest, on one hand; of a stone wall with tree-tops on some steep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31950">
     abyss below, just grazing it, on the other. Through these trees she saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31960">
     a momentary flash of water, far beneath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31980">
     Then the leaping front wheels struck a cluster of loose pebbles, at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_31990">
     bend.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32010">
     Wrenched from the drunkard's grip, the steering wheel jerked sharply
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32020">
     round.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32040">
     A skidding--a crash--a cry!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32060">
     Over the roadway, vacant now, floated a tenuous cloud of dust and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32070">
     gasoline-vapor, commingled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32090">
     In the retaining-wall at the left, a jagged gap appeared. Suddenly, far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32100">
     below, toward the river, a crashing detonation shattered harsh echoes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32110">
     from shore to shore.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32130">
     Came a quick flash of light; then thick, black, greasy smoke arose, and,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32140">
     wafting through the treetops, drifted away on the warm wind of that late
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32150">
     June afternoon.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32170">
     A man, some quarter of a mile to southward, on the great highway, paused
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32180">
     suddenly at sound of this explosion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32200">
     For a moment he stood there listening acutely, a knotted stick in hand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32210">
     his flannel shirt, open at the throat, showing a brown and corded neck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32220">
     The heavy knapsack on his shoulders seemed no burden to that rugged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32230">
     strength, as he stood, poised and eager, every sense centered in keen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32240">
     attention.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32260">
     "Trouble ahead, there, by the Eternal!" he suddenly exclaimed. His eye
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32270">
     had just caught sight of the first trailing wreaths of smoke, from up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32280">
     the cliff. "An auto's gone to smash, down there, or I'm a plute!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32300">
     He needed no second thought to hurl him forward to the rescue. At a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32310">
     smart pace he ran, halloo'ing loudly, to tell the victims--should they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32320">
     still live--that help was at hand. At his right, extended the wall. At
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32330">
     his left, a grove of sugar-maples, sparsely set, climbed a long slope,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32340">
     over the ridge of which the descending sun glowed warmly. Somewhat back
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32350">
     from the road, a rough shack which served as a sugar-house for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32360">
     spring sap-boiling, stood with gaping door, open to all the winds that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32370">
     blew. These things he noted subconsciously, as he ran.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32390">
     Then, all at once, as he rounded a sharp turn, he drew up with a cry.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32410">
     "Down the cliff!" he exclaimed. "Knocked the wall clean out, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32420">
     plunged! Holy Mackinaw, what a smash!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32440">
     In a moment he had reached the scene of the catastrophe. His quick eye
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32450">
     took in, almost at a glance, the skidding mark of the wheels, the ragged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32460">
     rent in the wall, the broken limbs of trees below.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32480">
     "Some wreck!" he ejaculated, dropping his stick and throwing off his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32490">
     knapsack. "_Hello, Hello, down there!_" he loudly hailed, scrambling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32500">
     through the gap.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32520">
     From below, no answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32540">
     A silence, as of death, broken only by the echo of his own voice, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32550">
     all that greeted his wild cry.

     THE RESCUE.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32660">
     Gabriel Armstrong leaped, rather than clambered, through the gap in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32670">
     wall, and, following the track of devastation through the trees,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32680">
     scrambled down the steep slope that led toward the Hudson.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32700">
     The forest looked as though a car of Juggernaut had passed that way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32710">
     Limbs and saplings lay in confusion, larger trees showed long wounds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32720">
     upon their bark, and here and there pieces of metal--a gray mud-guard, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32730">
     car door, a wind-shield frame, with shattered plate glass still clinging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32740">
     to it--lay scattered on the precipitous declivity. Beside these, hanging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32750">
     to a branch, Gabriel saw a gaily-striped auto robe; and, further down, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32760">
     heavy, fringed shawl.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32780">
     Again he shouted, holding to a tree-trunk at the very edge of a cliff of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32790">
     limestone, and peering far down into the abyss where the car had taken
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32800">
     its final plunge. Still no answer. But, from below, the heavy smoke
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32810">
     still rose. And now, peering more keenly, Armstrong caught sight of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32820">
     wreck itself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32840">
     "There it is, and burning like the pit of Hell!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32850">
     "And--what's that, under it? A man?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32870">
     He could not distinctly make out, so thick the foliage was. But it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32880">
     seemed to him that, from under the jumbled wreckage of the blazing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32890">
     machine, something protruded, something that suggested a human form,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32900">
     horribly mangled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32920">
     "Here's where I go down this cliff, whatever happens!" decided Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32930">
     And, acting on the instant, he began swinging himself down from tree to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32940">
     bush, from shrub to tuft of grass, clinging wherever handhold or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32950">
     foothold offered, digging his stout boots into every cleft and cranny of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32960">
     the precipice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32980">
     The height could not have been less than a hundred and fifty feet. By
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_32990">
     dint of wonderful strength and agility, and at the momentary risk of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33000">
     falling, himself, to almost certain death, Gabriel descended in less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33010">
     than ten minutes. The last quarter of the distance he practically fell,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33020">
     sliding at a tremendous rate, with boulders and loose earth cascading
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33030">
     all about him in a shower.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33050">
     He landed close by the flaming ruin.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33070">
     "Lucky this isn't in the autumn, in the dry season!" thought he, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33080">
     approached. "If it were, this whole cliff-side, and the woods beyond,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33090">
     would be a roaring furnace. Some forest-fire, all right, if the woods
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33100">
     weren't wet and full of sap!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33120">
     Parting the brush, he made his way as close to the car as the intense
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33130">
     heat would let him. The gasoline-tank, he understood, had burst with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33140">
     shock, and, taking fire, had wrapped the car in an Inferno of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33150">
     unquenchable flame. Now, the woodwork was entirely gone; and of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33160">
     wheels, as the long machine lay there on its back, only a few blazing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33170">
     spokes were left. The steel chassis and the engine were red-hot, twisted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33180">
     and broken as though a giant hammer had smitten them on some Vulcanic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33190">
     anvil.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33210">
     "There's a few thousand dollars gone to the devil!" thought he. But his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33220">
     mind did not dwell on this phase of the disaster. Still he was hoping,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33230">
     against hope, that human life had not been dashed and roasted out, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33240">
     the wreck. And again he shouted, as he worked his way to the other side
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33250">
     of the machine--to the side which, seen from the cliff above, had seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33260">
     to show him that inert and mangled body.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33280">
     All at once he stopped short, shielding his face with his hands, against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33290">
     the blaze.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33310">
     "Good God!" he exclaimed; and involuntarily took off his cap, there in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33320">
     the presence of death.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33340">
     That the man _was_ dead, admitted of no question. Pinned under the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33350">
     heavy, glowing mass of metal, his body must already have been roasted to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33360">
     a char. The head could not be seen; but part of one shoulder and one arm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33370">
     protruded, with the coat burned off and the flesh horribly crackled;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33380">
     while, nearer Gabriel, a leg showed, with a regulation chauffeur's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33390">
     legging, also burned to a crisp.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33410">
     "Nothing for me to do, here," said Gabriel aloud. "He's past all human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33420">
     help, poor chap. I don't imagine there can be anybody else in this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33430">
     wreck. I haven't seen anybody, and nobody has answered my shouts. What's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33440">
     to be done next?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33460">
     He pondered a moment, then, looking at the license plate of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33470">
     machine--its enamel now half cracked off, but the numbers still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33480">
     legible--drew out his note-book and pencil and made a memo of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33490">
     figures.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33510">
     "Four-six-two-two, N.Y.," he read, again verifying his numbers. "That
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33520">
     will identify things. And now--the quicker I get back on the road again,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33530">
     and reach a telephone at West Point, the better."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33550">
     Accordingly, after a brief search through the bushes near at hand, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33560">
     any other victim--a search which brought no results--he set to work once
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33570">
     more to climb the cliff above him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33590">
     The fire, though still raging, was obviously dying down. In half an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33600">
     hour, he knew, it would be dead. There was no use in trying to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33610">
     extinguish it, for gasoline defies water, and no sand was to be had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33620">
     along that rocky river shore.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33640">
     "Let her burn herself out," judged Gabriel. "She can't do any harm, now.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33650">
     The road for mine!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33670">
     He found the upward path infinitely more difficult than the downward,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33680">
     and was forced to make a long detour and do some hard climbing that left
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33690">
     him spent and sweating, before he again approached the gap in the wall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33700">
     Pausing here to breathe, a minute or two, he once more peered down at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33710">
     the still-smoking ruin far below. And, as he stood there all at once he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33720">
     thought he heard a sound not very far away to his right.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33740">
     A sound--a groan, a half-inchoate murmur--a cry!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33760">
     Instantly his every sense grew keen. Holding his breath he listened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33770">
     intently. Was it a cry? Or had the breeze but swayed one tree limb
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33780">
     against another; or did some boatman's hail, from far across the river,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33790">
     but drift upward to him on the cliff?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33810">
     "Hello! _Hello_!" he shouted again. "Anybody there?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33830">
     Once more he listened; and now, once more, he heard the sound--this time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33840">
     he knew it was a cry for help!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33860">
     "Where are you?" shouted he, plunging forward along the steep side of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33870">
     the cliff. "Where?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33890">
     No answer, save a groan.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33910">
     "Coming! Coming!" he hailed loudly. Then, guided as it seemed by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33920">
     instinct, almost as much as by the vague direction of the moaning call,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33930">
     he ploughed his way through brush and briar, on rescue bent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33950">
     All at once he stopped short in his tracks, wild-eyed, a stammering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33960">
     exclamation on his lips.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_33980">
     "A woman!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34000">
     True. There, lying as though violently flung, a woman was half-crouched,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34010">
     half-prone behind the roots of a huge maple that leaned out far above a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34020">
     sheer declivity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34040">
     He saw torn clothing, through the foliage; a white hand, out-stretched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34050">
     and bleeding; a mass of golden-coppery hair that lay dishevelled on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34060">
     bed of moss and last autumn's leaves.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34080">
     "A woman! Dying?" he thought, with a sudden stab of pity in his heart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34100">
     Then, forcing his way along, he reached her, and fell upon his knees at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34110">
     her side.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34130">
     "Not dead! Not dying! Thank God!" he exclaimed. One glance showed him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34140">
     she would live. Though an ugly gash upon her forehead had bathed her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34150">
     face in blood, and though he knew not but bones were broken, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34160">
     recognized the fact that she was now returning, fast, to consciousness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34180">
     Already she had opened her eyes--wild eyes, understanding nothing--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34190">
     was staring up at him in dazed, blank terror. Then one hand came up to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34200">
     her face; and, even as he lifted her in both his powerful arms, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34210">
     began to sob hysterically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34230">
     He knew the value of that weeping, and made no attempt to stop it. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34240">
     overwrought nerves, he understood, must find some outlet. Asking no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34250">
     question, speaking no word--for Gabriel was a man of action, not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34260">
     speech--he gathered her up as though she had been a child. A tall woman,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34270">
     she; almost as tall as he himself, and proportioned like a Venus. Yet to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34280">
     him her weight was nothing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34300">
     Sure-footed, now, and bursting through the brambles with fine energy, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34310">
     carried her to the gap in the wall, up through it, and so to the roadway
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34320">
     itself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34340">
     "Where--where am I?" the woman cried incoherently. "O--what--where--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34360">
     "You're all right!" he exclaimed. "Just a little accident, that's all.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34370">
     Don't worry! I'll take care of you. Just keep quiet, now, and don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34380">
     think of anything. You'll be all right, in no time!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34400">
     But she still wept and cried out to know where she might be and what had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34410">
     happened. Obviously, Gabriel saw, her reason had not yet fully returned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34420">
     His first aim must be to bathe her wound, find out what damage had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34430">
     done, and keeping her quiet, try to get help.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34450">
     Swiftly he thought. Here he and the woman were, miles from any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34460">
     settlement or house, nearly in the middle of a long stretch of road that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34470">
     skirted the river through dense woods. At any time a motor might come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34480">
     along; and then again, one might not arrive for hours. No dependence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34490">
     could be put on this. There was no telephone for a long distance back;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34500">
     and even had one been near he would not have ventured to leave the girl.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34520">
     Could he carry her back to Fort Clinton, the last settlement he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34530">
     passed through? Impossible! No man's strength could stand such a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34540">
     tremendous task. And even had it been within Gabriel's means, he would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34550">
     have chosen otherwise. For most of all the girl needed rest and quiet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34560">
     and immediate care. To bear her all that distance in his arms might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34570">
     produce serious, even fatal results.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34590">
     "No!" he decided. "I must do what I can for her, here and now, and trust
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34600">
     to luck to send help in an auto, down this road!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34620">
     His next thought was that bandages and wraps would be needed for her cut
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34630">
     and to make her a bed. Instantly he remembered the shawl and the big
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34640">
     auto-robe that he had seen caught among the trees.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34660">
     "I must have those at once!" he realized. "When the machine went over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34670">
     the edge, they were thrown out, just as the girl was. A miracle she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34680">
     wasn't carried down, with the car, and crushed or burned to death down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34690">
     there by the river, with that poor devil of a chauffeur!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34710">
     Laying her down in the soft grass along the wall, he ran back to where
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34720">
     the wraps were, and, detaching them from the branches, quickly regained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34730">
     the road once more.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34750">
     "Now for the old sugar-house in the maple-grove," said he. "Poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34760">
     shelter, but the best to be had. Thank heaven it's fair weather, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34770">
     warm!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34790">
     The task was awkward, to carry both the girl and the bulky robes, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34800">
     Gabriel was equal to it She had by now regained some measure of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34810">
     rationality; and though very pale and shaken, manifested her nerve and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34820">
     courage by no longer weeping or asking questions.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34840">
     Instead, she lay in his arms, eyes closed, with the blood stiffening on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34850">
     her face; and let him bear her whither he would. She seemed to sense his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34860">
     strength and mastery, his tender care and complete command of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34870">
     situation. And, like a hurt and tired child, outworn and suffering, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34880">
     yielded herself, unquestioningly, to his ministrations.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34900">
     Thus Gabriel, the discharged, blacklisted, outcast rebel and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34910">
     proletarian, bore in his arms of mercy and compassion the only daughter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34920">
     of old Isaac Flint, his enemy, Flint the would-be master of the world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34940">
     Thus he bore the woman who had been betrothed to "Tiger" Waldron,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34950">
     unscrupulous and cruel partner in that scheme of dominance and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34960">
     enslavement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34980">
     Such was the meeting of this woman and this man. Thus, in his arms, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_34990">
     carried her to the old sugar-house.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35010">
     And far below, the mighty river gleamed, unheeding the tragedy that had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35020">
     been enacted on its shores, unmindful of the threads of destiny even now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35030">
     being spun by the swift shuttles of Fate.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35050">
     In the branches, above Gabriel and Catherine, birdsong and golden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35060">
     sunlight seemed to prophesy. But what this message might be, neither the

     AN HOUR AND A PARTING.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35160">
     Arriving at the sugar-house, tired yet strong, Gabriel put the wounded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35170">
     girl down, quickly raked together a few armfuls of dead leaves, in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35180">
     most sheltered corner of the ramshackle structure, and laid the heavy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35190">
     auto-robe upon this improvised bed. Then he helped his patient to lie
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35200">
     down, there, and bade her wait till he got water to wash and dress her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35210">
     cut.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35230">
     "Don't worry about anything," he reassured her. "You're alive, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35240">
     that's the main thing, now. I'll see you through with this, whatever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35250">
     happens. Just keep calm, and don't let anything distress you!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35270">
     She looked at him with big, anxious eyes--eyes where still the full
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35280">
     light of understanding had not yet returned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35300">
     "It--it all happened so suddenly!" she managed to articulate. "He was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35310">
     drunk--the chauffeur. The car ran away. Where is it? Where is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35320">
     Herrick--the man?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35340">
     "I don't know," Gabriel lied promptly and with force. Not for worlds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35350">
     would he have excited her with the truth. "Never you mind about that.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35360">
     Just lie still, now, till I come back!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35380">
     Already, among the rusty utensils that had served for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35390">
     "sugaring-off," the previous spring, he had routed out a tin pail. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35400">
     kicked a quantity of leaves in under the sheet-iron open stove, flung
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35410">
     some sticks atop of them, and started a little blaze. Warm water, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35420">
     reflected, would serve better than cold in removing that clotting blood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35430">
     and dressing the hurt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35450">
     Then, saying no further word, but filled with admiration for the girl's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35460">
     pluck, he seized the pail and started for water.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35480">
     "Nerve?" he said to himself, as he ran down the road toward a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35490">
     brook he remembered having crossed, a few hundred yards to southward.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35500">
     "Nerve, indeed! Not one complaint about her own injuries! Not a word of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35510">
     lamentation! If this isn't a thoroughbred, whoever or whatever she is, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35520">
     never saw one!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35540">
     He returned, presently, with the pail nearly full of cold and sparkling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35550">
     water. Ignoring rust, he made her drink as deeply as she would, and then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35560">
     set a dipperful of water on the now hot sheet-iron.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35580">
     Then, tearing a strip off the shawl, he made ready for his work as an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35590">
     amateur physician.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35610">
     "Tell me," said he, kneeling there beside her in the hut which was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35620">
     already beginning to grow dusk, "except for this cut on your forehead,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35630">
     do you feel any injury? Think you've got any broken bones? See if you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35640">
     can move your legs and arms, all right."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35660">
     She obeyed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35680">
     "Nothing broken, I guess," she answered. "What a miracle! Please leave
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35690">
     me, now. I can wash my own hurt. Go--go find Herrick! He needs you worse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35700">
     than I do!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35720">
     "No he doesn't!" blurted Gabriel with such conviction that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35730">
     understood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35750">
     "You mean?" she queried, as he brought the dipper of now tepid water to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35760">
     her side. "He--he's dead?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35780">
     He hesitated to answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35800">
     "Dead! Yes, I understand!" she interpreted his silence. "You needn't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35810">
     tell me. I know!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35830">
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35850">
     "Yes," said he. "Your chauffeur has paid the penalty of trying to drive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35860">
     a six-cylinder car with alcohol. Now, think no more of him! Here, let me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35870">
     see how badly you're cut."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35890">
     "Let me sit up, first," she begged. "I--I'm not hurt enough to be lying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35900">
     here like--like an invalid!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35920">
     She tried to rise, but with a strong hand on her shoulder he forced her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35930">
     back. She shuddered, with the horror of the chauffeur's death strong
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35940">
     upon her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35960">
     "Please lie still," he begged. "You've had a terrific shock, and have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35970">
     lived through it by a miracle, indeed. You're wounded and still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_35980">
     bleeding. You _must_ be quiet!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36000">
     The tone in his voice admitted no argument. Submissive now to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36010">
     greater strength, this daughter of wealth and power lay back, closed her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36020">
     tired eyes and let the revolutionist, the proletarian, minister to her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36040">
     Dipping the piece of shawl into the warm water, he deftly moistened the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36050">
     dried blood on her brow and cheek, and washed it all away. He cleansed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36060">
     her sullied hair, as well, and laid it back from the wound.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36080">
     "Tell me if I hurt you, now," he bade, gently as a woman. "I've got to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36090">
     wash the cut itself."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36110">
     She answered nothing, but lay quite still. And so, hardly wincing, she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36120">
     let him lave the jagged wound that stretched from her right temple up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36130">
     into the first tendrils of the glorious red-gold hair.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36150">
     "H'm!" thought Gabriel, as he now observed the cut with close
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36160">
     attention. "I'm afraid there'll have to be some stitches taken here!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36170">
     But of this he said nothing. All he told her was: "Nothing to worry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36180">
     over. You'll be as good as new in a few days. As a miracle, it's _some_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36190">
     miracle!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36210">
     Having completed the cleansing of the cut, he fetched his knapsack and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36220">
     produced a clean handkerchief, which he folded and laid over the wound.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36230">
     This pad he secured in place by a long bandage cut from the edge of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36240">
     shawl and tied securely round her shapely head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36260">
     "There," said he, surveying his improvisation with considerable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36270">
     satisfaction. "Now you'll do, till we can undertake the next thing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36280">
     Sorry I haven't any brandy to give you, or anything of that sort. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36290">
     fact is, I don't use it, and have none with me. How do you feel, now?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36310">
     She opened her eyes and looked up at him with the ghost of a smile on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36320">
     her pale lips.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36340">
     "Oh, much, much better, thank you!" she answered. "I don't need any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36350">
     brandy. I'm--awfully strong, really. In a little while I'll be all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36360">
     right. Just give me a little more water, and--and tell me--who are you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36380">
     "Who am I?" he queried, holding up her head while she drank from the tin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36390">
     cup he had now taken from his knapsack. "I? Oh, just an out-of-work.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36400">
     Nobody of any interest to you!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36420">
     A certain tinge of bitterness crept into his voice. In health, he knew,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36430">
     a woman of this class would not suffer him even to touch her hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36450">
     "_Don't_ ask me who I am, please. And I--I won't ask _your_ name. We're
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36460">
     of different worlds, I guess. But for the moment, Fate has levelled the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36470">
     barriers. Just let it go at that. And now, if you can stay here, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36480">
     right; perhaps I can hike back to the next house, below here, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36490">
     telephone, and summon help."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36510">
     "How far is it?" she asked, looking at him with wonder in her lovely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36520">
     eyes--wonder, and new thoughts, and a strange kind of longing to know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36530">
     more of this extraordinary man, so strong, so gentle, so unwilling to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36540">
     divulge himself or ask her name.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36560">
     "How far?" he repeated. "Oh, four or five miles. I can make it in no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36570">
     time. And with luck, I can have an auto and a doctor here before dark.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36580">
     Well, does that suit you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36600">
     "Don't go, please," she answered. "I--I may be still a little weak and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36610">
     foolish, but--somehow, I don't want to be left alone. I want to be kept
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36620">
     from remembering, from thinking of those last, awful moments when the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36630">
     car was running away; when it struck the wall, at the turn; when I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36640">
     thrown out, and--and knew no more. Don't go just yet," the girl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36650">
     entreated, covering her eyes with both hands, as though to shut out the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36660">
     horrible vision of the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36680">
     "All right," Gabriel answered. "Just as you please. Only, if I stay, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36690">
     must promise to stop thinking about the accident, and try to pull
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36700">
     together."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36720">
     "I promise," she agreed, looking at him with strange eyes. "Oh dear,"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36730">
     she added, with feminine inconsequentiality, "my hair's all down, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36740">
     Lord knows where the pins are!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36760">
     He smiled to himself as she managed, with the aid of such few hairpins
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36770">
     as remained, to coil the coppery meshes once more round her head and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36780">
     even somewhat over the bandage, and secure them in place.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36800">
     At sight of his face as he watched her, she too smiled wanly--the first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36810">
     time he had seen a real smile on her mouth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36830">
     "I'm only a woman, after all," she apologized. "You don't understand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36840">
     You can't. But no matter. Tell me--why need you go, at all?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36860">
     "Why? For help, of course."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36880">
     "There's sure to be a motor, or something, along this road, before very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36890">
     long," she answered. "Put up some signal or other, to stop it. That will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36900">
     save you a long, long walk, and save me from--remembering! I need you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36910">
     here with me," she added earnestly. "Don't go--please!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36930">
     "All right, as you will," the man made reply. "I'll rig a danger-signal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36940">
     on the road; and then all we can do will be to wait."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36960">
     This plan he immediately put into effect, setting his knapsack in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36970">
     middle of the road and piling up brush and limbs of trees about it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_36990">
     "There," he said to himself, as he surveyed the result, "no car will get
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37000">
     by _that_, without noticing it!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37020">
     Then he returned to the sugar-house, some hundred yards back from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37030">
     highway in the grove, now already beginning to grow dim with the shadows
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37040">
     of approaching nightfall. The glowing coals of the fire gleamed redly,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37050">
     through the rough place. The girl, still lying on her bed of leaves and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37060">
     auto-robes, with the mutilated shawl drawn over her, looked up at him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37070">
     with an expression of trust and gratitude. For a second, only one,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37080">
     something quick and vital gripped at the wanderer's heart--some vague,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37090">
     intangible longing for a home and a woman, a longing old as our race,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37100">
     deep-planted in the inmost citadel of every man's soul. But,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37110">
     half-impatiently, he drove the thought away, dismissed it, and, smiling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37120">
     down at her with cheerful eyes and white, even teeth, said reassuringly:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37140">
     "Everything's all right now. The first machine that passes, will take
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37150">
     you to civilization."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37170">
     "And you?" she asked. "What of you, then?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37190">
     "Me? Oh, I'll hike," he answered. "I'll plug along just as I was doing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37200">
     when I found you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37220">
     "Where to?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37240">
     "Oh, north."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37260">
     "What for?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37280">
     "Work. Please don't question me. I'd rather you wouldn't."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37300">
     She pondered a moment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37320">
     "Are you--what they call a--workingman?" she presently resumed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37340">
     "Yes," said he. "Why?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37360">
     "And are you happy?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37380">
     "Yes. In a way. Or shall be, when I've done what I mean to do."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37400">
     "But--forgive me--you're very poor?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37420">
     "Not at all! I have, at this present moment, more than eighteen dollars
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37430">
     in my pocket, and I have _these_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37450">
     He showed her his two hands, big and sinewed, capable and strong.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37470">
     "Eighteen dollars," she mused, half to herself. "Why, I have spent that,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37480">
     and more, for a single ounce of a new perfume--something very rare, you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37490">
     know, from Japan."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37510">
     "Indeed? Well, don't tell _me_," he replied. "I'm not interested in how
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37520">
     you spend money, but how you get it."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37540">
     "Get it? Oh, father gives me my allowance, that's all."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37560">
     "And he squeezes it out of the common people?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37580">
     She glanced at him quickly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37600">
     "You--you aren't a Socialist, into the bargain, are you?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37620">
     "At your service," he bowed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37640">
     "This is strange, strange indeed," she said. "Tell me your name."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37660">
     "No," he refused. "I'd still rather not. Nor shall I ask yours. Please
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37670">
     don't volunteer it."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37690">
     Came a moment's silence, there in the darkening hut, with the fire-glow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37700">
     red upon their faces.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37720">
     "Happy," said the girl. "You say you're happy. While I--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37740">
     "Are not unhappy, surely?" asked Gabriel, leaning forward as he sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37750">
     there beside her, and gazing keenly into her face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37770">
     "How should I know?" she answered. "Unhappy? No, perhaps not. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37780">
     vacant--empty--futile!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37800">
     "Yes, I believe you," Gabriel judged. "You tell me no news. And as you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37810">
     are, you will ever be. You will live so and die so. No, I won't preach.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37820">
     I won't proselytize. I won't even explain. It would be useless. You are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37830">
     one pole, I the other. And the world--the whole wide world--lies
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37840">
     between!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37860">
     Suddenly she spoke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37880">
     "You're a Socialist," said she. "What does it mean to be a Socialist?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37900">
     He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37920">
     "You couldn't understand, if I told you," he answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37940">
     "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37960">
     "Oh, because your ideas and environments and interests and everything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37970">
     have been so different from mine--because you're what you are--because
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_37980">
     you can never be anything else."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38000">
     "You mean Socialism is something beyond my understanding?" she demanded,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38010">
     piqued. "Of course, that's nonsense. I'm a human being. I've got brains,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38020">
     haven't I? I can understand a scheme of dividing up, or levelling down,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38030">
     or whatever it is, even if I can't believe in it!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38050">
     He smiled oddly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38070">
     "You've just proved, by what you've said," he answered slowly, "that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38080">
     your whole concepts are mistaken. Socialism isn't anything like what you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38090">
     think it is, and if I should try to explain it, you'd raise ten thousand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38100">
     futile objections, and beg the question, and defeat my object of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38110">
     explanation by your very inability to get the point of view. So you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38120">
     see--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38140">
     "I see that I want to know more!" she exclaimed, with determination. "If
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38150">
     there's any branch of human knowledge that lies outside my reasoning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38160">
     powers, it's time I found that fact out. I thought Socialists were wild,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38170">
     crazy, erratic cranks; but if you're one, then I seem to have been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38180">
     wrong. You look rational enough, and you talk in an eminently sane
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38190">
     manner."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38210">
     "Thank you," he replied, ironically.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38230">
     "Don't be sarcastic!" she retorted. "I only meant--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38250">
     "It's all right, anyhow," said he. "You've simply got the old, stupid,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38260">
     wornout ideas of your class. You can't grasp this new ideal, rising
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38270">
     through the ruck and waste and sin and misery of the present system. I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38280">
     don't blame you. You're a product of your environment. You can't help
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38290">
     it. With that environment, how can you sense the newer and more vital
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38300">
     ideas of the day?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38320">
     For a moment she fixed eager eyes on him, in silence. Then asked she:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38340">
     "Ideals? You mean that Socialism has ideals, and that it's not all a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38350">
     matter of tearing down and dividing up, and destroying everything good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38360">
     and noble and right--all the accumulated wisdom and resources of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38370">
     world?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38390">
     He laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38410">
     "Who handed you that bunk?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38430">
     "Father told me Socialism was all that, and more,"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38450">
     "What's your father's business?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38470">
     "Why, investments, stocks, bonds, industrial development and all that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38480">
     sort of thing."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38500">
     "Hm!" he grunted. "I thought as much!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38520">
     "You mean that father misinformed me?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38540">
     "Rather!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38560">
     "Well, if he did, what is Socialism?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38580">
     "Socialism," answered the young man slowly, while he fixed his eyes on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38590">
     the smouldering fire, "Socialism is a political movement, a concept of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38600">
     life, a philosophy, an interpretation, a prophecy, an ideal. It embraces
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38610">
     history, economics, science, art, religion, literature and every phase
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38620">
     of human activity. It explains life, points the way to better things,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38630">
     gives us hope, strengthens the weary and heavy-laden, bids us look
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38640">
     upward and onward, and constitutes the most sublime ideal ever conceived
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38650">
     by the soul of man!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38670">
     "Can this be true?" the girl demanded, astonished.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38690">
     "Not only can, but is! Socialism would free the world from slavery and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38700">
     slaves, from war, poverty, prostitution, vice and crime; would cleanse
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38710">
     the sores of our rotting capitalism, would loose the gyves from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38720">
     fettered hands of mankind, would bid the imprisoned soul of man awake to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38730">
     nobler and to purer things! How? The answer to that would take me weeks.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38740">
     You would have to read and study many books, to learn the entire truth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38750">
     But I am telling you the substance of the ideal--a realizable ideal, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38760">
     no chimera--when I say that Socialism sums up all that is good, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38770">
     banishes all that is evil! And do you wonder that I love and serve it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38780">
     all my life?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38800">
     She peered at him in wonder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38820">
     "You serve it? How?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38840">
     "By spreading it abroad; by speaking for it, working for it, fighting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38850">
     for it! By the spoken and the printed word! By every act and through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38860">
     every means whereby I can bring it nearer and nearer realization!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38880">
     "You're a dreamer, a visionary, a fanatic!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38900">
     "You think so? No, I can't agree. Time will judge that matter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38910">
     Meanwhile, I travel up and down the earth, spreading Socialism."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38930">
     "And what do you get out of it, personally?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38950">
     "I? What do you mean? I never thought of that question."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38970">
     "I mean, money. What do you make out of it?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_38990">
     He laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39010">
     "I get a few jail-sentences, once in a while; now and then a crack over

     and despairing world!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39120">

     "You're a poet, I believe!" said she.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39160">
     "No, not that. Only a worker in the ranks."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39180">
     "But do you write poetry?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39200">
     "I write verses. You'd hardly call them poetry!"

     "Verses? About Socialism?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39240">
     "Sometimes."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39260">
     "Will you give me some?"

     "What do you mean?"

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39320">
     "Of course not! I can't recite my verses! They aren't worth bothering

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_39350">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40410">
     light over his strongly virile face, and gazed into the coals. The girl,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40420">
     lying on the rude bed, her face eager, her slim strong hands tightly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40430">
     clasped, had almost forgotten to breathe.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40450">
     At last she spoke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40470">
     "That--that is wonderful!" she cried, a tremor of enthusiasm in her

     voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40500">
     He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40520">
     "No compliments, please," said he.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40540">
     "I'm not complimenting you! I think it _is_ wonderful. You're a true

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40570">
     "I wish I were--so I might use it all for Socialism!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40590">
     "You could make a fortune, if you'd work for some paper or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40600">
     magazine--some regular one, I mean, not Socialist."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40620">
     He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40640">
     "Dead sea fruit," he answered. "Fairy gold, fading in the clutch,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40650">
     worthless through and through. No, if my work has any merit, it's all

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40680">
     Silence again. Neither now found a word to say, but their eyes met and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40690">
     read each other; and a kind of solemn hush seemed to lie over their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40700">
     hearts.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40720">
     Then, as they sat there, looking each at each--for now the girl had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40730">
     raised herself on the crude bed and was supporting herself with one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40740">
     hand--a sudden sound of a motor, on the road, awakened them from their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40750">
     musing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40770">
     Came the raucous wail of a siren. Then the engine-exhaust ceased; and a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40780">
     voice, raised in some annoyance, hailed loudly through the maple-grove:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40800">
     "Hello! Hello? What's wrong here?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40820">
     Gabriel stepped to the sugar-house door:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40840">
     "Here! Come here!" he shouted in a ringing voice that echoed wildly from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40850">
     between his hollowed palms.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40870">
     As the motorist still sat there, uncomprehending, Gabriel made his way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40880">
     toward the road.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40900">
     "Accident here," said he. "Girl in here, injured. Can you take her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40910">
     the nearest town, at once? She needs a doctor."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40930">
     Instantly the man was out of his car, and hastening toward Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40950">
     "Eh? What?" he asked. "Anything serious?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40970">
     In a few words, Gabriel told him the outlines of the tale.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_40990">
     "The quicker you get the girl to a town, and let her have a doctor and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41000">
     communication with her family, the better," he concluded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41020">
     "Right! I'll do all in my power," said the other, a rather stout,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41030">
     well-to-do, vulgar-looking man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41050">
     "Good! This way, then!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41070">
     The man followed Gabriel to the sugar-house. They found the girl already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41080">
     on her feet, standing there a bit unsteadily, but with determination to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41090">
     be game, in every feature.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41110">
     Five minutes later she was in the new-comer's car, which had been turned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41120">
     around and now was headed back toward Haverstraw. The shawl and robe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41130">
     serving her as wraps, she was made comfortable in the tonneau.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41150">
     "Think you can stand it, all right?" asked Gabriel, as he took in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41160">
     the hand she extended. "In half an hour, you'll be under a doctor's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41170">
     care, and your father will be on his way toward you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41190">
     She nodded, and for a second tightened the grasp of her hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41210">
     "I--I'm not even going to know who you are?" she asked, a strange tone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41220">
     in her voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41240">
     "No," he answered. "And now, good luck, and good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41260">
     "Good-bye," she echoed, her voice almost inaudible. "I--I won't forget
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41270">
     you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41290">
     He made no answer, but only smiled in a peculiar way.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41310">
     Then, as the car rolled slowly forward, their hands separated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41330">
     Gabriel, bareheaded and with level gaze, stood there in the middle of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41340">
     the great highway, looking after her. A minute, under the darkening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41350">
     arches of the forest road, he saw her, still. Then the car swung round
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41360">
     a bend, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41380">
     Had she waved her hand at him? He could not tell. Motionless he stood, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41390">
     while, then cleared away the barrier of branches that obstructed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41400">
     road, took up his knapsack, and with slow steps returned to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41410">
     sugar-house.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41430">
     Almost on the threshold, a white something caught his eye. He picked it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41440">
     up. Her handkerchief! A moment he held the dainty, filmy thing in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41450">
     rough hand. A vague perfume reached his nostrils, disquieting and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41460">
     seductive.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41480">
     "More than eighteen dollars an ounce, perhaps!" he exclaimed, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41490">
     sudden bitterness; but still he did not throw the handkerchief away.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41500">
     Instead, he looked at it more keenly. In one corner, the fading light
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41510">
     just showed him some initials. He studied them, a moment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41530">
     "C.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;F." he read. Then, yielding to a sudden impulse, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41540">
     folded the kerchief and put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41560">
     He entered the sugar-house, to make sure, before departing, that he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41570">
     left no danger of fire behind him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41590">
     Another impulse bade him sit down on a rough box, there, before the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41600">
     dying embers. He gazed at the bed of leaves, a while, immersed in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41610">
     thought, then filled his pipe and lighted it with a glowing brand, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41620">
     sat there--while the night came--smoking and musing, in a reverie.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41640">
     The overpowering lure of the woman who had lain in his arms, as he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41650">
     borne her thither; her breath upon his face; the perfume of her, even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41660">
     her blood that he had washed away--all these were working on his senses,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41670">
     still. But most of all he seemed to see her eyes, there in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41680">
     ember-lit gloom, and hear her voice, and feel her lithe young body and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41690">
     her breast against his breast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41710">
     For a long time he sat there, thinking, dreaming, smoking, till the last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41720">
     shred of tobacco was burned out in the heel of his briar; till the last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41730">
     ember had winked and died under the old sheet-iron stove.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41750">
     At last, with a peculiar laugh, he rose, slung the knapsack once more on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41760">
     his shoulders, settled his cap upon his head, and made ready to depart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41780">
     But still, one moment, he lingered in the doorway. Lingered and looked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41790">
     back, as though in his mind's eye he would have borne the place away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41800">
     with him forever.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41820">
     Suddenly he stooped, picked up a leaf from the bed where she had lain,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41830">
     and put that, too, in his pocket where the kerchief was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41850">
     Then, looking no more behind him, he strode off across the maple-grove,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41860">
     through which, now, the first pale stars were glimmering. He reached the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41870">
     road again, swung to the north, and, striking into his long marching
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41880">
     stride, pushed onward northward, away and away into the soft June
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41890">
     twilight.

     TIGER WALDRON "COMES BACK."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41980">
     Old Isaac Flint loved but two things in all this world--power, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_41990">
     daughter Catherine.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42010">
     I speak advisedly in putting "power" first. Much as he idolized the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42020">
     girl, much as she reminded him of the long-dead wife of his youth, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42030">
     could have survived the loss of her. The loss of power would inevitably
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42040">
     have crushed and broken him, stunned him, killed him. Yet, so far as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42050">
     human affection could still blossom in that withered heart, shrunk by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42060">
     cold scheming and the cruel piracies of many decades, he loved the girl.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42080">
     And so it was that when the message came in, that evening, over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42090">
     telephone, the news that Kate had been injured in an auto-accident which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42100">
     had entirely destroyed the machine and killed Herrick, he paled,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42110">
     trembled, and clutched the receiver, hardly able to hold it to his ear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42120">
     with his shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42140">
     "Here! You!" he cried. "She--she's not badly hurt? She's living? She's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42150">
     safe? No lies, now! The truth!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42170">
     "Your daughter is very much alive, and perfectly safe," a voice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42180">
     answered. "This is Doctor MacDougal, of Haverstraw, speaking. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42190">
     patient is now having a superficial scalp wound dressed by my assistant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42200">
     You can speak to her, in a few minutes, if you like."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42220">
     "Now! For God's sake, let me speak _now_!" entreated the Billionaire;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42230">
     but the doctor refused. Not all Flint's urging or bribing would turn him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42240">
     one hair's breadth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42260">
     "No," he insisted. "In ten minutes she can talk to you. Not now. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42270">
     have no fear, sir. She is perfectly safe and--barring her wound, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42280">
     will probably heal almost without a scar--is as well as ever. A little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42290">
     nervous and unstrung, of course, but that's to be expected."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42310">
     "What happened, and how?" demanded Flint, in terrible agitation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42330">
     The doctor briefly gave him such facts as he knew, ending with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42340">
     statement that a passing automobilist had brought the girl to him, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42350">
     outlining the situation of the first-aid measures in the sugar-house. At
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42360">
     the thought that Herrick, the drunken cause of it all, was dead and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42370">
     burned, Flint smiled with real satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42390">
     "Damn him! It's too good for the scum!" he muttered. Then, aloud, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42400">
     asked over the wire:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42420">
     "And who was the rescuer?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42440">
     "I don't know," MacDougal answered. "Your daughter didn't tell me. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42450">
     from what I've learned, he must have been a man of rare strength and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42460">
     presence of mind. It may well be that you owe your daughter's life to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42470">
     his prompt work."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42490">
     "I'll find him, yet. He'll be suitably rewarded," thought the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42500">
     Billionaire. "No matter what my enemies have called me, I'm not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42510">
     incapable of gratitude!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42530">
     Some few minutes later, having paced the library floor meanwhile, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42540">
     great excitement, he called the doctor's house again by long-distance,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42550">
     and this time succeeded in having speech with his daughter. Her voice,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42560">
     though a little weak, vastly reassured him. Once more he asked for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42570">
     outline of the story. She told him all the essentials, and finished by:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42590">
     "Now, come and get me, won't you, father dear? I want to go home. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42600">
     the quicker you come for me, the happier I'll be."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42620">
     "Bless your heart, Kate!" he exclaimed, deeply moved. "Nothing like the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42630">
     old man, after all, is there? Yes, I'll start at once. I've only been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42640">
     waiting here, to talk with you and _know_ you're safe. In five minutes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42650">
     I'll be on my way, with the racing-car. And if I don't break a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42660">
     records between here and Haverstraw, my name's not Isaac Flint!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42680">
     After an affectionate good-bye, the old man hung up, rang for Slawson,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42690">
     his private valet, and ordered the swiftest car in his garage made ready
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42700">
     at once, for a quick run.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42720">
     Two hours later, Doctor MacDougal had pocketed the largest fee he ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42730">
     had received or ever would, again; and Kate was safe at home, in Idle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42740">
     Hour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42760">
     On the homeward journey, Flint learned every detail of the affair, from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42770">
     start to finish; and again grimly consigned the soul of the dead
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42780">
     chauffeur to the nethermost pits of Hell. Yes, he realized, he must have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42790">
     the body brought in and decently buried, after the coroner's verdict had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42800">
     been rendered; but in his heart he knew that, save for the eye of public
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42810">
     opinion and the law, he would let those charred remnants lie and rot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42820">
     there, by the river bank, under the twisted wreckage of the car--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42830">
     revel in the thought of that last, barbarous revenge.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42850">
     Arrived at home, Flint routed specialists out of their offices, and at a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42860">
     large expense satisfied himself the girl had really taken no serious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42870">
     harm. Next day, and the days following, all that money and science
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42880">
     could do to make the gash heal without a scar, was done. Waldron called,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42890">
     greatly unnerved and not at all himself; and Kate received him with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42900">
     amicable interest. She had not yet informed her father of the rupture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42910">
     between Waldron and herself, nor did he suspect it. As for "Tiger," he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42920">
     realized the time was inopportune for any statement of conditions, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42930">
     held his peace. But once she should be well, again, he had savagely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42940">
     resolved this decision of hers should not stand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42960">
     "Damn it, it can't! It mustn't!" he reflected, as on the third evening
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42970">
     he returned to his Fifth Avenue house. "Now that I'm really in danger of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42980">
     losing her, I'm just beginning to realize what an extraordinary woman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_42990">
     she is! As a wife, the mistress of my establishment, a hostess, a social
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43000">
     leader, what a figure she would make! And too, the alliance between
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43010">
     Flint and myself simply must not be shattered. Kate is the only child.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43020">
     The old man's billion, or more, will surely come to her, practically
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43030">
     every penny of it. Flint is more than sixty-three this very minute, he's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43040">
     a dope-fiend, and his heart's damned weak. He's liable to drop off, any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43050">
     moment. If I get Kate, and he dies, what a fortune! What a prize! Added
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43060">
     to my interests, it will make me master of the world!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43080">
     "Then, too, this new Air Trust scheme positively demands that Flint and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43090">
     I should be bound together by something closer than mere financial
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43100">
     association. I've simply got to be one of the family. I've got to be his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43110">
     son-in-law. That's a positive necessity! God, what a fool I was at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43120">
     Longmeadow, to have taken those three drinks, and have been piqued at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43130">
     her beating me--to have let my tongue and temper slip--in short, to have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43140">
     acted like an ass!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43160">
     Ugly and grim, he puffed at his Londres. Vast schemes of finance and of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43170">
     conquest wove through his busy, plotting brain. Visions of the girl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43180">
     arose, too, tempting him still more, though his chill heart was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43190">
     powerless to feel the urge of any real, self-sacrificing or devoted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43200">
     love. Sensual passion he knew, and ambition, and the lust of power;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43210">
     nothing else. But these all opened his eyes to the vast blunder he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43220">
     committed, and nerved him to reconquest of the ground that he had lost.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43240">
     "I can win her, yet," reflected he, as his car swung into the long and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43250">
     brilliant night-vista of Fifth Avenue. "I know women, and I understand
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43260">
     the game. Flowers, letters, telephone calls, attention every day--every
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43270">
     hour, if need be--these are the artillery to batter down the strongest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43280">
     fortresses of indifference, even of dislike. And she shall have them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43290">
     all--all and more. Wally, old chap, you've never been beaten at any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43300">
     game, whether in the Street or in the pursuit of woman. You'll win yet;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43310">
     you're bound to win! And Kate shall yet open the door to you, toward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43320">
     wealth and power and position such as never yet were seen on earth!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43340">
     Thus fortified by his own determination, he slept more calmly that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43350">
     night. And, on the morrow, his campaign began.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43370">
     It lasted but a week.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43390">
     At the end of that time, a friendly little note from Idle Hour told him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43400">
     frankly and in the kindest manner possible, that--much as she still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43410">
     liked and respected him--Catherine could not, now or ever, think of him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43420">
     in any other way than as a friend.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43440">
     Stunned by this body-blow, "Tiger" first swore with hideous blasphemies
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43450">
     that caused his valet to retreat precipitately from the famous,

     nymph-frieze bedchamber; then ordered drink, then walked the floor a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43470">
     while in a violent passion; and finally knit up his decision.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43490">
     "By God!" he swore, shaking his fist in the direction of Englewood.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43500">
     "She's balky, eh? She won't, eh? But _I_ say she _will_! And if I can't

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43530">
     in this world setting up opposition to Flint and Waldron, combined! Just
    </p>

     fancy it, that's all!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43560">
     "So then, what's to do? This: See her father and have a heart-to-heart
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43570">
     talk with him. It's obvious she hasn't told him, yet, the real state of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43580">
     affairs. I doubt if the old idiot has even noticed the absence of my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43590">
     ring from her finger. And if he has, she's been able to fool him, easily
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43600">
     enough. But not much longer, so help me!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43620">
     "No, this very morning he shall hear from me, the whole infernal
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43630">
     story--he shall learn his daughter's unreasonable rebellion, the slight

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43640">
     she's put upon me and her opposition to his will. _Then_ we shall

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43670">
     With this strong determination in his superheated mind, Waldron rang up

     Flint, asked for a private talk, at eleven, in the Wall Street office,
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43700">
     appeals to Flint's every sense of interest and liking; his whole plea

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43730">
     And Catherine, all this time of convalescence--what were her thoughts,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43740">
     and whither were they straying? Not thoughts of Waldron, that is sure,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43750">
     despite his notes, his telephoning, his flowers, his visits. Not to him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43760">
     did they wander, as she sat in her sunny bedroom bay-window, looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43770">
     out over the great, close cropped lawn, through the oaks and elms, to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43780">
     the Palisades and the sparkling Hudson beneath.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43800">
     No, not to Waldron. Yet wander they did, despite her; and with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43810">
     persistence they followed channels till then quite unknown to her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43830">
     What might these channels be? And whither, I ask again, did the girl's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43840">
     memories and fancies, her wondering thoughts, her vague, half-formulated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43850">
     longings, lead?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43870">
     You, perhaps, can answer, as well as I, if you but remember

     that--Billionaire's daughter though she was, and all unversed in the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43960">
     THOUGHTS.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_43990">
     During the long days, the June days, of her convalescence, Catherine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44000">
     found herself involuntarily reverting, more often than she could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44010">
     understand, to thoughts of the inscrutable and unknown man who had in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44020">
     all probability saved her life.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44040">
     "Had it not been for him," she reflected, as she sat there gazing out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44050">
     over the river, "I might not be here, this minute. Caught as I was, on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44060">
     the very brink of the precipice, I should almost certainly have slipped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44070">
     and fallen over, in my dazed condition, when I tried to get up. If I'd
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44080">
     been alone, if he hadn't found me just when he did--!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44100">
     She shuddered at thought of what must almost inevitably have happened,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44110">
     and covered her face with both hands. Her cheeks burned; she knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44120">
     emotion such as not once had Waldron's kiss ever been able to arouse in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44130">
     her. The memory of how she, half-unconscious, had lain in that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44140">
     stranger's arms, so powerful and tense; had been carried by him, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44150">
     though she had been a child; had felt his breath upon her face and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44160">
     quick, vigorous beating of his heart--all this, and more, dwelt in her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44170">
     soul, nor could she banish it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44190">
     Gratitude? Yes, and more. For the first time in her two-and-twenty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44200">
     years, Catherine had sensed the power, the virility of a real man--not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44210">
     of the make-believe, manicured and tailored parasites of her own
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44220">
     class--and something elemental in her, some urge of primitive womanhood,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44230">
     grappled her to that memory and, all against her will, caused her to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44240">
     live and re-live those moments, time and time again, as the most strange
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44250">
     and vital of her life.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44270">
     Yet, it was not this physical call alone, in her, that had awakened her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44280">
     being. The man's eyes, and mouth and hair, true, all remained with her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44290">
     as a subtly compelling lure; his strength and straight directness seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44300">
     to conquer her and draw her to him; but beyond all this, something in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44310">
     his speech, in his ideas and the strange reticence that had so puzzled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44320">
     her, kept him even more constantly in her wondering thoughts.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44340">
     "A workingman," she murmured to herself, in uncomprehending revery, "he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44350">
     said he was a workingman--and he knew that I was very, very rich. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44360">
     knew my father would have rewarded him magnificently, given him money,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44370">
     work, anything he might have asked. And yet, and yet--he would not even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44380">
     tell his name. And he refused to know mine! He didn't want to know! His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44390">
     pride--why, in all my life, among all the proud, rich people that I've
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44400">
     known, I've never found such pride as that!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44420">
     She reflected what would have happened had any man of the usual type
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44430">
     rescued her, even a man of wealth and position. Of course, thought she,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44440">
     that man would have made himself known and would have called on her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44450">
     ostensibly to inquire after her condition, yet really to ingratiate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44460">
     himself. At this reflection she shuddered again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44480">
     "Ugh!" she whispered. "He'd have tried to take liberties, any other man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44490">
     would. He'd have presumed on the accident--he'd have been--oh,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44500">
     everything that _that_ man was not, and could never be!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44520">
     Now her thoughts wandered to the brief talk they two had had there in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44530">
     the old sugar-house. Every word of it seemed graven on her memory.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44540">
     Disconnected bits of what he had told her, seemed to float before her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44550">
     mental vision--: "I? Oh, I'm just an out-of-work--don't ask me who I am;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44560">
     and I won't ask who _you_ are. We're of different worlds, I guess--don't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44570">
     question me; I'd rather you wouldn't. Am I happy? Yes, in a way, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44580">
     shall be, when I've done what I mean to do!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44600">
     Such were some of his phrases that kept coming back to her, as she sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44610">
     there in that luxurious and beautiful room, her book lying unread in her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44620">
     lap, the scent of flowers everywhere, and, merely for her taking, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44630">
     the world's treasures hers to command. Strange man, indeed, and stranger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44640">
     speech, to her! Never had she been thus spoken to. His every word and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44650">
     thought and point of view, commonplace enough, perhaps, seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44660">
     peculiarly stimulating to her, and wakened eager curiosity, and would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44670">
     not let her live in peace, as heretofore.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44690">
     "He said he was a Socialist, too," she murmured, "whatever that may be.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44700">
     But he--he didn't _look_ it! On the contrary, he looked remarkably clean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44710">
     and intelligent. And the words he used were the words of an educated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44720">
     man. Far better vocabulary than Waldron's, for example; and as for poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44730">
     little Van Slyke, and that set, why this man's mind seems to have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44740">
     towered above them as the Palisades tower above the river!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44760">
     "Happy? Rich? He said he was both--and all he had was eighteen dollars
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44770">
     and his two big hands! Just fancy that, will you? He might as well have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44780">
     said eighteen cents; it would have been about as much! And I--what did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44790">
     I tell him? I told him I, with all my money and everything, was vacant,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44800">
     empty, futile! Just those words. And--God help me, I--I am!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44820">
     Suddenly, she felt her eyes were wet. What was the reason? Herself she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44830">
     knew not. All she knew was that with her beautiful and queenly head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44840">
     bowed on the arm of her Japanese silk morning gown, as its loose sleeves
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44850">
     lay along the edge of the Chippendale table, she was crying like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44860">
     child.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44880">
     Crying bitterly; and yet in a kind of new, strange joy. Crying with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44890">
     tears so bitter-sweet that she, herself, could not half understand them;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44900">
     could not fathom the deeper meaning that lay hidden there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44920">
     "If!" she whispered to her heart. "If only I were of his class, or he of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44930">
     mine!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44950">
     And Gabriel, what of him?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44970">
     As he swung north and westward, day by day, on the long hike toward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44980">
     Niagara, the memory of the girl went with him, and hour by hour bore him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_44990">
     company.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45010">
     He was not forgetting. Could he forget? Strive as he might, to thrust
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45020">
     her out of his heart and soul, she still indwelt there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45040">
     Not all his philosophy, nor all his realization that this woman he had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45050">
     saved, this woman who had lain in his two arms and mingled her breath
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45060">
     with his, belonged to another and an alien class, could banish her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45080">
     And as he strode along, swinging his knotted stick at the daisies and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45090">
     pondering on all that might have been and now could never be, a sudden,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45100">
     passionate longing burst over him, as a long sea-roller, hurled against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45110">
     a cliff, flings upward in vast tourbillions of spume.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45130">
     Raising his face to the summer sky, his bare head high with emotion and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45140">
     his eyes wide with the thought of strange possibilities that shook and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45150">
     intoxicated him, he cried:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45170">
     "Oh--would God she were an orphan and an outcast! Would God she had no

     FLINT AND WALDRON PLAN.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45270">
     "Tiger" Waldron's interview with old man Flint, regarding Catherine's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45280">
     breaking of the engagement, was particularly electric. Promptly at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45290">
     appointed hour, Waldron appeared, shook hands with the older man, sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45300">
     down and lighted a cigar, then proceeded to business.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45320">
     "Flint," said he, without any ado, "I've come here to tell you some very
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45330">
     unpleasant news and to ask your help. Can you stand the one, and give me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45340">
     the other?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45360">
     The Billionaire looked at him through his pince-nez, poised on that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45370">
     vulture-beak, with some astonishment. Then he smiled nervously, showing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45380">
     his gleaming tooth of gold, and answered:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45400">
     "Yes, I guess so. What's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45420">
     "What's wrong? Everything! Catherine has broken our engagement!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45440">
     For a moment old Flint sat there motionless and staring. Then, moving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45450">
     his head forward with a peculiar, pecking twitch that still further
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45460">
     enhanced his likeness to a buzzard, he stammered:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45480">
     "You--you mean--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45500">
     "I mean just what I say. Your daughter has severed the betrothal.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45510">
     Haven't you noticed my ring was gone from her finger?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45530">
     "Gone? Bless my soul, no--that is, yes--maybe. I don't know. But--but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45540">
     at any rate, I thought nothing of it. So then, you say--she's broken it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45550">
     off? But, why? And when? And--and tell me, Wally, what's it all about?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45570">
     "Listen, and I _will_ tell you," Tiger answered. "And I'll give it to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45580">
     you straight. I'm partly at fault. Mostly so, it may be. Let me assume
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45590">
     all the blame, at any rate. I'm not sparing myself and have no intention
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45600">
     of doing so. My conduct, I admit, was beastly. No excuses offered. All I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45610">
     want to do, now, is to make the _amende honorable_, be forgiven, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45620">
     have the former status resumed."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45640">
     Thus spoke Waldron. But all the time his soul lay hot within him, at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45650">
     having so to humble himself before Flint; at being thus obliged to eat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45660">
     crow, and fawn and feign and creep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45680">
     "If I didn't need your billion, old man," his secret thought was, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45690">
     eyed Flint with pretended humility, "you might go to Hell, for all of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45700">
     me--you and your daughter with you, damn you both!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45720">
     The Billionaire sat blinking, for a moment. Then, picking up a pencil
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45730">
     and idly scrawling pothooks on the big clean sheet of blotting-paper
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45740">
     that covered his reference-book table, beside which the men were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45750">
     sitting, he asked:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45770">
     "Well, what's the trouble all about? What are the facts? I must have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45780">
     those, in full, before I can guarantee to do anything toward changing my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45790">
     daughter's opinion. Much as I deplore her action, Wally, I don't know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45800">
     whether she's right or wrong, till you tell me. Now, let's have it."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45820">
     "I will," the other answered; and he was as good as his word. Realizing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45830">
     the prime futility of any subterfuge, or any misstatement of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45840">
     fact--which Catherine would surely discover and tell her father, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45850">
     which would react against him--Waldron began at the beginning and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45860">
     narrated the entire affair, with every detail precisely accurate. Nay,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45870">
     he even exaggerated the offensiveness of his conduct, at the Longmeadow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45880">
     Club, and in various ways gave the Billionaire to understand that he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45890">
     a more serious offender than in truth he really was. For, after all, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45900">
     only real offense was the lack of any compatibility between the girl and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45910">
     himself--the total absence of love.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45930">
     Flint listened carefully and with a judicial expression. If he blamed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45940">
     Waldron, he made no statement of that fact. A man himself, and one who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45950">
     viewed man's weaknesses and woman's foibles with a cynic eye, he could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45960">
     judge motives and weigh actions with considerable skill.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45980">
     "I see, I see," he commented, when Waldron had quite done, and had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_45990">
     poured forth a highly false declaration of his great love for the girl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46000">
     and his determination that this rupture should not be permanent. "I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46010">
     understand the case, I think. It all seems an unfortunate accident--just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46020">
     one of those unavoidable incidents which strike into and upset human
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46030">
     calculations, against all expectation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46050">
     "You're not terribly guilty, Waldron. You acted inconsiderably.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46060">
     Irritatingly, perhaps, and not wholly like a gentleman--for which, blame
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46070">
     the rotten Scotch they _will_ persist in selling, out there at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46080">
     Longmeadow. But even that's not fatal. Many men have done worse and been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46090">
     forgiven. I'll have a talk with Catherine, inside a day or two, when the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46100">
     psychological moment offers. And you may be sure, if a father's advice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46110">
     and good offices are of any avail, this little quarrel will be all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46120">
     patched up between you two. Surely will be! I can almost positively
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46130">
     promise you that!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46150">
     "Promise it?" asked Waldron, leaning eagerly forward, a strange light in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46160">
     those close-set, greenish eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46180">
     Flint nodded. "Yes," he answered. "I've never yet failed to bring Kate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46190">
     to reason and good common-sense, when I've set out to. This will be no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46200">
     exception. My word and my counsel possess the greatest weight with her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46210">
     She'll listen and be advised, I'm sure. So have no uneasiness," he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46220">
     concluded, holding out his hand to his partner. "Leave everything to me.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46230">
     You'll see, it will all come right, in the end."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46250">
     "Tiger" shook his hand, cordially.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46270">
     "I haven't words to thank you!" he exclaimed, with as much emotion as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46280">
     could simulate from a perfectly cold heart and calculating soul.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46300">
     "Don't try to," the Billionaire replied, with seeming benevolence. "All
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46310">
     the thanks I want, Wally, is to patch up this little difficulty and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46320">
     reunite two--that is--two loving, sympathetic hearts!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46340">
     "You old hypocrite!" Waldron thought, eyeing him. "All _you_ want of me,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46350">
     if anything, is to keep me as your partner, because you know you're
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46360">
     growing old and losing your grip, and I'm still in the game with all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46370">
     four claws! Paternal philanthropist _you_ are--I don't think!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46390">
     Wally was dead right.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46410">
     "I can't lose this man," the Billionaire was thinking. "Whether or no,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46420">
     Kate has got to marry him. This Air Trust business demands a strong, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46430">
     quick, a perfectly unscrupulous hand. And no outsider will do. My
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46440">
     partner has got to be my son-in-law. Love be damned! Romantic slush can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46450">
     go to Hell! Kate will marry him--she's _got_ to--or I'll know the reason
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46460">
     why!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46480">
     "Though, after all," he soothed his conscience, as Waldron stood up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46490">
     walked to the window and stood gazing out as he smoked, "after all,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46500">
     Wally will make her as happy, I fancy, as any man. He's a fine figure in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46510">
     the world, commanding, heavily propertied, energetic and successful,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46520">
     also of the finest family connections. Yes, a husband any woman might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46530">
     admire and be proud of. Certainly, the only son-in-law for _me_. Even if

     she can't idolize and worship him, as some fool women think they must, a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46550">
     man, she can respect and be respected with him. And with him she can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46560">
     take the highest position in the land, without a qualm as to his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46570">
     competence and manner. Beside all that, what's love? Love? Bah!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46590">
     With which philosophy, he too arose, went back into his own office, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46600">
     returned to the dictating of some very private letters to Slade, the

     Cosmos Detective Agency manager, _in re_ the ferreting-out and jailing

    </p>

     deemed most essential. The Cosmos people, scenting a big contract, had

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46650">
     fostered his belief, and now, already, the work was well under way.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46660">
     Subterranean methods were still sufficing; but, should these fail,

     others lay in the background.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46690">
     Flint smiled a grim, vulturine smile as he read over the finished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46700">
     letters of instruction, a few minutes later.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46720">
     "And to think," he mused, as he finished them, "that these fanatics

     "Well," he concluded, handing the letters back to his confidential

     secretary, for mailing, "well, now _that's_ done, at any rate. So then,

     interview with his daughter, who had so far rebelled against his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_46920">
     After a simple but exquisite dinner in the Venetian room, he asked the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47020">
     the approaching interview; and now the subtle drug filled him with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47030">
     well-being and seemed to enhance his self-control and power. Lighting a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47040">
     cigar--rare treat for him--he offered Kate his arm; and together,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47050">
     unattended by any valet or domestic, they walked along the high,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47060">
     paneled hallway, hung with Gobelin tapestries, and so reached the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47070">
     magnificent music-room which Kate claimed, in a way, as her own special
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47080">
     place at Idle Hour.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47100">
     Here everything suggested harmony. The mahogany wainscotted walls were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47110">
     decked with fine portraits of the world's great masters of melody.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47120">
     Handsome cabinets contained costly and elaborate collections and folios
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47130">
     of music, a complete library of the entire world's best productions. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47140">
     girl's harp--a masterpiece by Pestalozzi of Venice--stood at one side;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47150">
     on the other, a five hundred dollar Victrola, with a wonderful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47160">
     repertoire of records. But the grand piano itself dominated all,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47170">
     especially made for Catherine by Durand FrÃ¨res, in Paris, and imported
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47180">
     on the Billionaire's own yacht, the "Bandit." A wondrous instrument,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47190">
     this, finer even than the pipe-organ in an alcove at the far end of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47200">
     room. It summed up all that the world's masters knew of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47210">
     instrument-production; and its cost, from factory to its present place
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47220">
     at Idle Hour, represented twenty years' wages, and more, of any of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47230">
     Flint's slaves in the West Virginia mines or the Glenn Pool oil-fields
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47240">
     of Oklahoma.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47260">
     At this magnificent piano the girl now seated herself, on a bench of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47270">
     polished teak, from Mindanao. And, turning to her father, who had sunk
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47280">
     down in his favorite easy-chair of Russia leather, she asked with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47290">
     smile:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47310">
     "Well, daddy, what shall I play for you, to-night?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47330">
     He looked at her a minute, before replying. Never had she seemed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47340">
     dear, so beautiful to him. The rose-tinted light that fell softly from a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47350">
     Bohemian chandelier over her head, flooded her coiled hair, her face,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47360">
     her hands, with soft warm color. The slight dressing that her wound now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47370">
     required was covered by a deft arrangement of her hair. She had regained
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47380">
     her usual tint. Nothing now told of the accident, the close call she had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47390">
     had, from death, so short a time before. And old Flint smiled, as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47400">
     answered her:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47420">
     "What shall you play? Anything you like, my dear. You know best--only,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47430">
     don't make it too classical. Your old father isn't up to that ultra
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47440">
     music, you know, and never will be!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47460">
     She smiled again with understanding, and turned to the keyboard. Then,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47470">
     without notes, and with a delicate touch of perfectly modulated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47480">
     interpretation, she began to render "TraÃ¼merei," as though she, too, had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47490">
     been dreaming of something that might have been.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47510">
     Flint listened, with perfect content. The music soothed and quieted him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47520">
     Even the foreknowledge of the difficult task that lay before him, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47530">
     interview that he must have with his daughter, faded from his mind, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47540">
     little, and left him wholly calm. Eyes closed, every sense intent on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47550">
     delicious harmony, he followed the masterpiece to the end; and sighed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47560">
     when the last notes had died away, and kept silence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47580">
     Then Kate, still needing no music on the rack before her, played the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47590">
     "Miserere" from "Il Trovatore," a Hungarian "Czardas," Mendelssohn's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47600">
     "FrÃ¼hlingslied" and the overture from "William Tell." She followed these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47610">
     with the "Intermezzo" and the "Pizzicato" from "Sylvia," and then with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47620">
     "Narcissus" and "Sans Souci." And at the end of this, she paused again;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47630">
     for now her father had arisen and come close to her. With a hand on her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47640">
     shoulder, looking down at her with stern yet kindly eyes, he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47660">
     "'Sans Souci'? That means 'Without Care,' doesn't it, Kate?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47680">
     "Yes, Daddy. Why?" she answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47700">
     "Oh, I was just thinking, that's all," said he. "It made me wish _I_ had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47710">
     no cares, no troubles, no sorrows."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47730">
     "Sorrows, father? Why should you have sorrows?" she queried, turning to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47740">
     him and taking both his shriveled hands in her warm, strong ones.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47760">
     "Sorrows? Why shouldn't I?" said he. "Every man of large affairs has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47770">
     them. Every father has them, too." And he bent over her and kissed her,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47780">
     with unusual emotion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47800">
     "Every father?" asked she. "What do you mean? Am _I_ a sorrow to you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47820">
     "A joy in many ways," he answered. "In some, a sorrow."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47840">
     "In what ways?" she asked quickly, her eyes widening.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47860">
     "In this way, most of all," he told her, as he took her left hand up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47870">
     and pointed at the finger where Waldron's ring had been and now no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47880">
     longer was.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47900">
     She looked at him a moment, hardly understanding; then bowed her head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47920">
     "Father," she whispered. "Forgive me--but I couldn't! I--I couldn't! No,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47930">
     not for the world!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47950">
     Flint's drug-contracted eyes hardened as he stood there gazing down at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47960">
     her. Once, twice he essayed to speak, but found no words. At last,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47970">
     however, blinking nervously, he said:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_47990">
     "This, Kate, is what I want to talk with you about, to-night. Will you

     hear me?"

     "Hear you, best and dearest father in the world?" she cried, looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48100">
     quickly up at him again. "Of course I will! Only, I beg you,
    </p>

     don't--don't ask me to--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48130">
     "I will ask you nothing, Kate, my girl, save this--to consider

     everything well, and to act like a reasoning, thinking creature, not

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48170">
     Releasing her hands, he once more sat down in the easy-chair, crossed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48180">
     his legs and peered keenly at her, to fathom if he could the inner
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48190">
     workings of that other brain and heart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48210">
     "Well, father," she said, "I'll admit, right away, that I've done wrong
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48220">
     to keep this from you, or to try to. We--I--broke the engagement, that
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48240">
     everything and explain it all, but somehow--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48260">
     "You needn't explain, my dear," said Flint, judicially. "Wally has
    </p>

     already done so."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48290">
     "And does he blame me, father?" cried the girl, eagerly, clasping her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48300">
     hands on her knees.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48320">
     "No, not at all. On the contrary, he claims the fault is all his own.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48330">
     And he's most contrite and repentant, Kate. Absolutely so. All he asks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48340">
     in the world is to make amends and--well, resume the old relation,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48350">
     whenever you are willing."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48370">
     Kate shook her head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48390">
     "That's noble and big of him, father," said she, "to assume all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48400">
     blame. Really, half of it is mine. But he's acted like a true man, in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48410">
     taking it. However, that can't change my decision. I want him for a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48440">
     The Billionaire frowned darkly. Already a stronger opposition was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48450">
     developing than he had expected; and opposition was the one thing in all
    </p>

     the world that he could neither tolerate nor endure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48480">
     "Listen, Kate," said he. "You don't grasp the situation at all. Waldron
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48490">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48510">
     thing for you, like--for instance--that young man who rescued you, and
    </p>

     whom I shall suitably reward as soon as I find him--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48540">
     "What!" she exclaimed, peering eagerly at her father. "What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48550">
     Find him? Reward him?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48570">
     "Eh? Why, naturally," the Billionaire replied, scowling at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48580">
     interruption. "His game of refusing his identity was, of course, just a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48590">
     clever dodge on his part. He certainly must expect something out of it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48600">
     I have--er--set certain forces at work to discover him; and, as I say,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48610">
     when I've done so, I will reward him liberally, and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48630">
     "You'd better _not_!" ejaculated Kate, with animation. "He isn't the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48640">
     sort of man you can take liberties with!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48660">
     "Hm? What now?" said Flint, with vexation. "What do _you_ know about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48670">
     him?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48690">
     "Oh, nothing, nothing, father," the girl answered quickly. "Only, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48700">
     think you're making a mistake to try and force a reward on a man who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48710">
     doesn't want it. But no matter," she added, her face tinged by a warmer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48720">
     glow--which Flint was quick to see. "Forgive my interruption. Now, about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48730">
     Wally?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48750">
     The old man peered intently at his daughter, a full minute, then with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48760">
     peculiar sinking at his heart, made shift to say:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48780">
     "About Wally, yes; you simply don't understand. That's all. Listen now,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48790">
     Kate, and be reasonable."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48810">
     "I will, daddy. Only don't ask me to marry a man I don't and can't love,

     ever, ever, so long as I live!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48840">
     "That isn't anything, my girl. Love isn't all."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48860">
     "It is, to _me_! Without it, marriage is only--" She shuddered. "No,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48870">
     daddy; a thousand times better for me to be an old maid, and--and all

     that, than give myself to _him_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48900">
     Flint set his teeth hard together.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_48920">
     "Kate," said he, his voice like wire, "now hear what I have to say! I

     She only shook her head; and now he saw the glister of tear-drops in
    </p>

     those beautiful gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49170">
     "Father," cried she, standing up and holding out both hands to him.

     luxury around her. "Without love, what would such another home be to me?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49210">
     Worse than a prison-cell, I swear! A living death, to one like me!

     The Billionaire, too, stood up. He was shaking, now, as in a palsy,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49290">
     striving to control his rage. His fingers twitched spasmodically, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49300">
     his eyes burned like firecoals behind those gleaming lenses.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49320">
     Then, as he peered at her, he suddenly went even paler than before.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49330">
     Through his heart a stab of understanding had all at once gone home. The

     veils were lifted, and he knew the truth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49360">
     Her manner in speaking of that unknown, wandering rescuer; the blush

     her aversion for Waldron and her reticence in talking of the
    </p>

     accident--all this, and more, now surged on Flint's comprehension,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49400">
     flooding his mind with light--with light and with terrible anger.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49420">
     And, losing all control, he took a step or two, and raised his shaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49430">
     hand. His big-knuckled finger, shaken in denunciation, was raised almost
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49440">
     in her face. Choking, stammering, he cried:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49460">
     "Ah! Now I know! Now, now I understand you!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49480">
     Terrified, she retreated toward the door of the music-room.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49500">
     "Father, father! What makes you look so?" she gasped. "Oh, you have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49510">
     never looked or spoken to me this way! What--what can it be?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49530">
     "What can it be?" he mouthed at her. "You ask me, you hypocrite, when
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49540">
     you well know?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49560">
     Suddenly she faced him, stiffening into pride and hard rebellion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49580">
     "No more of that, father!" she exclaimed, her eyes blazing. "I am your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49590">
     daughter, but you can't talk to me thus. You must not!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49610">
     "Who--who are _you_ to say 'must not?'" he gibed, now wholly beside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49620">
     himself. "You--you, who love a vagabond, a tramp, scum and off-scouring
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49630">
     of the gutter?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49650">
     A strange, half-choking sound was his only answer. Then, with no word,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49660">
     she turned away from him, biting her lip lest she answer and betray
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49670">
     herself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49690">
     "Go!" he commanded, bloodless and quivering. "Go to your room. No more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49700">
     of this! We shall see, soon, who's master of this house!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49720">
     She was already gone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49740">
     Old Flint stood there a moment, listening to her retreating footfalls on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49750">
     the parquetry of the vast hall. Then, as these died he turned and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49760">
     groped his way, as though blind, back to his chair, and fell in it, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49770">
     covered his eyes with both his shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49790">
     For a long time he sat there, anguished and crucified amid all that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49800">
     unmeaning luxury and splendor.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49820">
     At last he rose and with uncertain steps sought his own suite,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49830">
     above-stairs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49850">
     Billionaire and world-master though he was, that night he knew his heart
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49860">
     lay dead within him. He realized that all the fruits of life were Dead
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_49870">
     Sea fruits, withered to dust and ashes on his pale and quivering lips.

     studied it carefully, under the electric bulb beside his dressing-table.

     electrical and chemical worker. A Socialist and labor agitator, of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_50300">
     the most dangerous type, because intellectual and well-read. A man

     resourceful.

     Discharged by your Mr. Herzog, about two weeks ago for having, I

     Armstrong is in possession of some private information about your
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_50440">
     that you and Mr. Waldron have had Armstrong blacklisted. But this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_50450">
     seems of no importance to the man, as he is clever and can live

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_50510">
     nothing to give me any legal means of proceeding against him. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_50520">

     This he folded and put in an envelope which he addressed to Slade, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_50980">
     was about to seal, when another idea struck him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51000">
     "By God!" he exclaimed, smiting the desk. "It won't do to have this just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51010">
     some ordinary charge. The thing has got to be disgraceful, unpardonable,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51020">
     hideous!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51040">
     "There are two things to be considered now. One is to 'get' him, in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51130">
     wreck him, forever, with her. Something that, when I tell her, will fill
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51140">
     her with loathing and horror. Something that will cause a terrible and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51150">
     complete revulsion of feeling in her, and bring her back to Waldron, as

     demands!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51210">
     He pondered a moment, an ugly, crafty smile on those old lips of his;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51220">
     then, struck by sudden inspiration, laughed a dry, harsh laugh.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51240">
     "The very thing!" he exulted, with the mirth of a vulture that has just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51250">
     found a peculiarly revolting mass of carrion. "Fool that I was, not to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51260">
     have thought of it before!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51280">
     Hastily he withdrew the letter from the envelope, opened it, and with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51290">
     eager hand wrote three short sentences. He read these over, nodded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51300">
     approval, and this time sealed and addressed the letter. Then he pushed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51310">
     an electric button over the desk.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51330">
     "Have this letter carried to this address at once," he commanded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51340">
     Slawson. "Mr. Dillon Slade, 432 Highland Avenue, Rutherford, N.&amp;nbsp;J.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51360">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51370">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51390">
     "Yes, sir. All right, sir," the valet bowed as he took the letter and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51400">
     departed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51420">
     Ten minutes later, he was back again, helping old Flint undress.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51440">
     Long after the Billionaire was in bed, in the big, luxurious room, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51450">
     its windows open toward the river--the room guarded all night by armed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51460">
     men in the house and on the lawn outside--he lay there thinking of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51470">
     plot, chuckling to himself over its infernal cunning, and filled with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51480">
     joy at the prospects now opening out ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51500">
     "Two birds with one stone, this time, for sure," he pondered. "Ha!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51510">
     They'll try to beat old Isaac Flint at this or any other game, will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51520">
     they? Man or woman, I don't care which, they'll never get away with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51530">
     it--never, so long as life and breath remain in me!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51550">
     Then, soothed by these happy thoughts, and by a somewhat increased
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51560">
     dosage of his drug, the Billionaire gradually and contentedly fell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51570">
     asleep, to dream of victory, and vengeance, and power.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51590">
     Not in weeks had he slumbered so peacefully.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51610">
     But for many hours after her father was asleep, Catherine sat at her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51620">
     window, in a silk kimono, and with fevered pulses and dry eyes, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51630">
     throbbing heart and leaping pulses, thought long thoughts.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51650">
     Sleepless she sat there, counting the hours tolled from the church-spire

     in the town, below.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51680">
     Morning still found her at the window, her brain afire, her heart laid

     swept and ravaged it.

     GABRIEL, GOOD SAMARITAN.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51790">
     On the evening of July third, a week later, Gabriel Armstrong found
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51800">
     himself at Rochester, having tramped the hundred miles from Syracuse, by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51810">
     easy stages. During this week, old Flint took good care not to reopen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51820">
     the subject of the break with Waldron; and his daughter, too, avoided
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51830">
     it. They two were apparently at an impasse regarding it. But Flint
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51840">
     inwardly rejoiced, knowing full well the plot now under way. And though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51850">
     Waldron urged him to take some further action and force the issue, Flint
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51860">
     bade him hold his peace, and wait, telling him all would yet be well.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51880">
     Outwardly calmer, the old man was raging, within, more and ever more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51890">
     bitterly, against Armstrong. On July first, Slade had reported in person
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51900">
     that his operators who were trailing the quarry had--in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51910">
     night--discovered in one of his pockets a maple leaf wrapped in a fine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51920">
     linen handkerchief marked "C.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;F." Flint, recognizing his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51930">
     daughter's initials, well-nigh burst a blood-vessel for wrath. But he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51940">
     instructed Slade not to have the handkerchief abstracted from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51950">
     Armstrong's possession. By no sign or hint must the victim be made aware
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51960">
     that he was being spied upon. When the final blow should fall, then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51970">
     (reflected the Billionaire, with devilish satisfaction) all scores would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_51980">
     be paid in full, and more than paid.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52000">
     July third, then, found Gabriel at Rochester, now seventy-five or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52010">
     eighty miles from Niagara Falls, his goal, where--he had already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52020">
     heard--ground was being actually broken for the huge new power plant of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52030">
     which he alone, of all outsiders, understood the meaning. Gabriel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52040">
     counted on spending the Fourth at Rochester where a Socialist picnic and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52050">
     celebration had been arranged. Ordinarily, he would have taken part in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52060">
     the work and volunteered as a speaker, but now, anxious to keep out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52070">
     sight, he counted merely on forming one of the crowd. There could be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52080">
     little danger, thought he, in such a mass. Despite the recent stringent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52090">
     censorship and military rule of the district by the new Mounted Police,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52100">
     a huge gathering was expected. The big railway and lake-traffic strikes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52110">
     both recently lost, had produced keen resentment, and, as political and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52120">
     economic power had been narrowed here, as all over the country, in these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52130">
     last few months of on-sweeping capitalist domination, the Socialist
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52140">
     movement had been growing ever more and more swiftly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52160">
     "It will be worth seeing," thought Gabriel, as he stood outside the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52170">
     lodging-house where he had taken a room for the night. The workers are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52180">
     surely awakening, at last. The spirit I've been meeting, lately, is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52190">
     uglier and more determined than anything I ever used to find, a year or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52200">
     two ago. It seems to me, if conditions are like this all over the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52210">
     country, the safety-valve is about ready to pop, and the masters had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52220">
     better look out, or some of them are going to land in Hell!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52240">
     "Yes, I'll stop over here, one day, and look and listen. Sorry I can't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52250">
     take part, but I mustn't. My game, now, is to travel underground as it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52260">
     were. I've got a bigger job in view than soap-boxing, just _now_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52280">
     He ate a simple supper at an "Owl" lunch-cart, totally unaware that,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52290">
     across the street, a couple of Cosmos men were waiting for him to come
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52300">
     out. And, after this, buying a Socialist paper, he strolled into Evans
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52310">
     Park to sit and read, a while, by the red light of the descending sun.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52330">
     Here he remained till dark, smoking his briar, watching the dirty,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52340">
     ragged children of the wretched wage-slaves at play; observing the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52350">
     exploited men and women on the park-benches, as they sought a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52360">
     fresh air and respite from toil; and pondering the problems that still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52370">
     lay before him. At times--often indeed--his thoughts wandered to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52380">
     maple-grove and the old sugar-house, far away on the Hudson. Memories of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52390">
     the girl would not be banished, nor longings for her. Who she might be,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52400">
     he still knew not. Unwilling to learn, he had refrained from looking up
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52410">
     the number he had copied from the plate of the wrecked machine. He had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52420">
     even abstained from reading the papers, a few days, lest he might see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52430">
     some account of the accident. A strange kind of unwillingness to know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52440">
     the woman's name possessed him--a feeling that, if he positively
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52450">
     identified her as one of some famous clan of robbers and exploiters, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52460">
     could no longer cherish her memory or love the thought of how they two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52470">
     had, for an hour, sat together and talked and been good, honest friends.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52490">
     "No," he murmured to himself, "it's better this way--just to recall her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52500">
     as a girl in need, a girl who let me help her, a girl I can always
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52510">
     remember with kind thoughts, as long as I live!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52530">
     From his pocket he took the little handkerchief, which wrapped the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52540">
     leaf, once part of her bed. A faint, elusive scent still hung about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52550">
     it--something of her, still it seemed. He closed his eyes, there on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52560">
     hard park bench, and let his fancies rove whither they would; and for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52570">
     time it seemed to him a wondrous peace possessed him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52590">
     "If it could only have been," he murmured, at last. "If only it could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52600">
     be!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52620">
     Then suddenly urged by a realization of the hopelessness of it all, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52630">
     stood up, pocketed the souvenirs of her again, and walked away in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52640">
     dusk; away, through the park; away, at random, through squalid, ugly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52650">
     streets, where the first electric-lights were just beginning to flare;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52660">
     where children swarmed in the close heat, wallowing along the gutters,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52670">
     dodging teams and cars, as they essayed to play, setting off a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52680">
     premature firecrackers and mocking the police--all in all, leading the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52690">
     ugly, unnatural, destructive life of all children of the city

     proletariat.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52720">
     "Poor little devils!" thought Gabriel, stopping to observe a dirty group
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52730">
     clustered about an ice-cream cart, where cheap, adulterated,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52740">
     high-colored stuff was being sold for a penny a square--aniline poison,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52750">
     no doubt, and God knows what else. "Poor little kids! Not much like the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52760">
     children of the masters, eh? with their lawns and playgrounds, their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52770">
     beaches and flowery fields, their gardens and fine schools, their dogs,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52780">
     ponies, autos and all the rest! Some difference, all right--and it takes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52790">
     a thousand of _these_, yes, ten thousand, to keep one of _those_.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52800">
     And--and _she_ was one of the rich and dainty children! Her beauty,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52810">
     health and grace were bought at the price of ten thousand other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52820">
     children's health, and joy and lives! Ah, God, what a price! What a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52830">
     cruel, awful, barbarous price to pay!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52850">
     Saddened and pensive, he passed on, still thinking of the woman he could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52860">
     not banish from his mind, despite his bitterness against her class.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52880">
     So he walked on and on, now through better streets and now through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52890">
     worse, up and down the city.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52910">
     Here and there, detonations and red fire marked the impatience of some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52920">
     demonstrator who could not wait till midnight to show his ardent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52930">
     patriotism and his public spirit by risking life and property. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52940">
     saloons were all doing a land-office business, with the holiday
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52950">
     impending and the thermometer at 97. Now and then, slattern women, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52960">
     foul clothes and with huge, gelatinous breasts, could be seen rushing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52970">
     the growler, at the "family entrance" of some low dive. Even little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52980">
     girls bore tin pails, for the evening's "scuttle o' suds" to be consumed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_52990">
     on roof, or in back yard of stinking tenement, or on some fire-escape.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53000">
     The city, in fine, was relaxing from its toil; and, as the workers for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53010">
     the most part knew no other way, nor could afford any, they were trying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53020">
     to snatch some brief moment of respite from the Hell of their slavery,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53030">
     by recourse to rough ribaldry and alcohol.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53050">
     Nine o'clock had just struck from the church-spires which mocked the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53060">
     slums with their appeal to an impassive Heaven, when, passing a foul and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53070">
     narrow alley that led down to the Genesee River, Gabriel saw a woman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53080">
     sitting on a doorstep, weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53100">
     This woman--hardly more than a girl--was holding a little bundle in one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53110">
     hand. The other covered her face. Her sobs were audible. Grief of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53120">
     most intense, he saw at once, convulsed her. Two or three by-standers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53130">
     watching with a kind of pleased curiosity, completed the scene, most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53140">
     sordid in its setting, there under the flicker of a gas-light on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53150">
     corner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53170">
     "Hm! What now?" thought Gabriel, stopping to watch the little tragedy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53180">
     "More trouble, eh? It's trouble all up and down the line, for these poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53190">
     devils! Nothing but trouble for the slave-class. Well, well, let's see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53200">
     what's wrong _now_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53220">
     Gabriel turned down the alley, drew near the little group, and halted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53240">
     "What's wrong?" he asked, in the tone of authority he knew how to use;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53250">
     the tone which always overbore his outward aspect, even though he might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53260">
     have been clad in rags; the tone which made men yield to him, and women
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53270">
     look at him with trustful eyes, even as the Billionaire's daughter had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53280">
     looked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53300">
     "Search _me_!" murmured one of the men, shrugging his shoulders. "_I_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53310">
     can't git nothin' out o' her. She's been sittin' here, cryin', a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53320">
     minutes, that's all I know; an' she won't say nothin' to nobody.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53340">
     "Any of you men know anything about it?" demanded Gabriel, looking at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53350">
     the rest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53370">
     A murmur of negation was his only answer. One or two others, scenting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53380">
     some excitement, even though only that of a distressed woman--common
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53390">
     sight, indeed!--lingered near. The little group was growing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53410">
     Gabriel bent and touched the woman's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53430">
     "What's the matter?" asked he, in a gentle voice. "If you're in trouble,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53440">
     let me help you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53460">
     Renewed sobs were her only answer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53480">
     "If you'll only tell me what's the matter," Gabriel went on, "I'm sure
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53490">
     I can do something for you."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53510">
     "You--you can't!" choked the woman, without raising her head from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53520">
     corner of the ragged shawl that she was holding over her eyes. "Nobody
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53530">
     can't! Bill, he's gone, and Eddy's gone, and Mr. Micolo says he won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53540">
     let me in. So there ain't nothin' to do. Let me alone--oh dear, oh dear,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53550">
     dear!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53570">
     Fresh tears and grief. The little knot of spectators, still growing,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53580">
     nodded with approval, and figuratively licked its lips, in satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53590">
     Somewhere a boy snickered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53610">
     "Come, come," said Gabriel, bending close over the grief-stricken woman,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53620">
     "pull together, and let's hear what the trouble is! Who's Bill, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53630">
     who's Eddy--and what about Mr. Micolo? Come, tell me. I'm sure I can do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53640">
     something to straighten things out."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53660">
     No answer. Gabriel turned to the increasing crowd, again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53680">
     "Any of you people know what about it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53700">
     Again no answer, save that one elderly man, standing on the steps beside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53710">
     the woman, remarked casually:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53730">
     "I guess she's got fired out of her room. That's all I know."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53750">
     Gabriel took her by the arm, and drew her up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53770">
     "Come, now!" said he, a sterner note in his voice. "This won't do! You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53780">
     mustn't sit here, and draw a crowd. First thing you know an officer will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53790">
     be along, and you may get into trouble. Tell me what's wrong, and I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53800">
     promise to see you through it, as far as I can."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53820">
     She raised her face, now, and looked at him, a moment. Tear-stained and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53830">
     dishevelled though she was, and soiled by marks of drink and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53840">
     debauchery, Gabriel saw she must once have been very beautiful and still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53850">
     was comely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53870">
     "Well," he asked. "Aren't you going to tell me?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53890">
     "Tell you?" she repeated. "I--oh, I can't! Not in front of all them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53900">
     men!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53920">
     "Very well!" said he, "walk with me, and give me your story. Will you do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53930">
     that? At all events, you mustn't stay here, making a disturbance on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53940">
     highway. If you knew the police as well as I do, you'd understand that!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53960">
     "You're right, friend," said she, hoarsely. "I'm on, now. Come along
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53970">
     then--I'll tell you. It ain't much to tell; but it's a lot to me!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_53990">
     She glanced at the curious faces of the watchers, then turned and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54000">
     followed Gabriel, who was already walking up the alley, toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54010">
     brighter lights of Stuart Street. For a moment, one or two of the men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54020">
     hesitated as though undecided whether or not to follow after; but one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54030">
     backward look by Gabriel instantly dispelled any desire to intrude. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54040">
     as Gabriel and the woman turned into the street, the little knot of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54050">
     curiosity-seekers dissolved into its component atoms, and vanished.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54140">
     "It--it's all along o' that there Mr. Micolo!" the woman suddenly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54150">
     exclaimed, "Him an' his rent-bill! If he'd ha' let me in, there,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54160">
     tonight, I could ha' got Ed's things an' then started to my sister's,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54170">
     out to Scottsville. But he wouldn't. He claimed they was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54180">
     two-seventy-five still owin', and I didn't have but about fifty cents,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54190">
     so I couldn't pay it. So he wouldn't let me in. Natchally, anybody'd

     feel bad, like that, 'specially when a man told 'em he'd hold their

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54230">
     "Naturally, of course," answered Gabriel, rather dazed by this sudden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54240">
     burst of details, with which she seemed to think he should already be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54250">
     quite familiar--details all sordid and commonplace, through which he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54260">
     seemed to perceive, dimly as in a dark glass, some mean and ugly tragedy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54270">
     of poverty and ignorance and sin.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54290">
     "Are you hungry?" he asked, all at once. "If so, come in here, where we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54300">
     can talk quietly and get things straight." He pointed at a cheap

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54310">
     restaurant, across the street.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54330">
     "Hungry? Gord, yes!" she exclaimed. Only I--I wouldn't ask, if I fell on

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54340">
     the sidewalk! Fifty cents--yes, I got that much, but I been tryin' to

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54370">
     "All right, forget that, now," commanded Gabriel. He took her by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54380">
     arm and piloted her across the thoroughfare, then into the dingy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54390">
     hash-house and to a table in a far corner. A few minutes later, pretty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54400">
     much everything on the bill of fare was before them on the greasy table.

     "Not a word till you're satisfied," directed Armstrong. "I'll just take

     a little bread and coffee, to keep you company."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54450">
     The woman adequately proved her statement that she was hungry. Rarely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54460">
     had Gabriel seen anybody eat with such ravenous appetite. He watched her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54470">
     with satisfaction, and when she could consume no more, smiled as he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54480">
     asked:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54500">
     "Now, then, feel better? If so, let's tackle the next problem. What's

     your grief?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54530">
     The woman stared at him a long moment before she made reply. Then she

     Gabriel shook his head.

     "No," said he, "nothing of that kind. You can trust me. Let's have the

     "Hm! It ain't much, I s'pose," she answered still half-suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54640">
     "Bill and me was livin' together, that's all. No, not married, nor

     nothin'--but--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54670">
     "All right. Go on."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54690">
     "That was last winter. When the kid happened--Ed, you know--Bill, he got

     sore, an' beat it. Then I--I went on the street, to keep Ed. Nothin'

     else to do, Mister, so help me, an'--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54730">
     "Never mind, I understand," said Gabriel. "What next?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54750">
     "And after that, I gets sick. _You_ know. Almost right away. So I has

     to go to St. Luke's hospital. I leaves Ed with Mrs. McCane, at the same

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54790">
     can't even get his things. Because why? Mrs. McCane's gone, Gord knows

     down there to Scottsville, to my sister's; but curse _me_ if I'll go

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54820">
     till I pay that devil an' get them clothes!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54840">
     A sudden savage light in her blurred eyes betrayed the passion of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54850">
     mother-love, through all the filth and soilure of her degradation.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54860">
     Gabriel felt his heart deeply moved. He bent toward her, across the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54870">
     table, touched her hand and asked:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54890">
     "Will you accept five dollars, to pay this man and get you down to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54900">
     Scottsville?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54920">
     "Huh?" she queried, gazing at him with vacant, uncomprehending eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54940">
     He repeated his query. Then, as he saw the slow tears start and roll
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54950">
     down her wan cheeks, he felt a greater joy within his breast than if the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54960">
     world and all its treasures had been his.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54980">
     "Will I take it?" she whispered. "Gord, _will_ I? You bet I will! That
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_54990">
     is, if I can have your name, an' pay it back some time?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55010">
     He promised, and wrote it down for her, giving as his address Socialist
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55020">
     Headquarters in Chicago. Then, without publicity, he slipped a V into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55030">
     her trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55050">
     "Come on," said he. "_That's_ all settled!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55070">
     He paid the check, and they went out, together. For a moment they stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55080">
     together, undecided, on the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55100">
     "Couldn't I get them things to-night, an' start?" asked she, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55110">
     "There's a train at 11:08, on the B.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;P."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55130">
     "All right," he assented. "Can you see this Micolo, now? It's after
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55140">
     ten."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55160">
     "Oh, _that_ don't make no difference," she answered. "He runs a pawnshop
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55170">
     over here on Dexter Street, two blocks east. He'll be open till
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55180">
     midnight, easy, tomorrow bein' the Fourth."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55200">
     "Come on, then," said Gabriel. "I'll see you through the whole business,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55210">
     and onto the train. Maybe I can help you, all along."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55230">
     Without another word she started, with Gabriel at her side. They
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55240">
     traversed the main street, two blocks, then turned to the left down a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55250">
     narrower, darker one.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55270">
     "Here's Micolo's," said she, pausing at a doorway. Gabriel nodded. "All
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55280">
     right," he answered. He had not noted, nor did he dream, that, at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55290">
     corner behind them, two slinking, sneaking figures were now watching his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55300">
     every move.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55320">
     The woman turned the knob, and entered. Gabriel followed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55340">
     "It's on the second floor," said she. Gabriel saw a sign, on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55350">
     landing: "S.&amp;nbsp;L. Micolo, Pawn Broker," and motioned her to precede
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55360">
     him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55380">
     In a minute they had reached the upper hallway. The woman opened another
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55390">
     door. The room, inside, was dark.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55410">
     "This way," said she. "He's in the inside office, I guess. The light
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55420">
     must ha' gone out here, some way or other."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55440">
     Gabriel hesitated. Some inkling, some vague intuition all at once had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55450">
     come upon him, that all was not well. At his elbow some invisible force
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55460">
     seemed plucking. "Come away! Come back, before it is too late!" some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55470">
     ghostly voice seemed calling in his ear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55490">
     But still, he did not fully understand. Still he remained there, his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55500">
     mind obsessed by the plausibility of the woman's story and by the pity
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55510">
     he so keenly felt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55530">
     And now he heard her voice again:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55550">
     "Mr. Micolo! Oh, Mr. Micolo! Where are you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55570">
     Striking a match, he advanced into the room.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55590">
     "Any gas here?" he asked, peering about for a burner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55610">
     Suddenly he started with violent emotion. Behind him, in some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55620">
     unaccountable way, the door had been closed. He heard a key turn,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55630">
     softly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55650">
     "What--what's this?" he exclaimed. He heard the woman moving about,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55660">
     somewhere in the gloom. "See here!" he cried. "What kind of a--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55680">
     The match burned brightly, all at once. He peered about him, wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55700">
     "This is no office!" shouted he. "Here, you! What's the meaning of this?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55710">
     This is a bed-room!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55730">
     Sudden realization of the trap stunned and sickened him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55750">
     "God! They've got me! Flint and Waldron--they've landed me, at last!" he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55760">
     choked. "But--but not till I've broken a few heads, by God!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55780">
     The match fell from his burnt fingers. Whirling toward the door, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55790">
     rained powerful kicks upon it. He would get out, he must get out, at all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55800">
     hazards!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55820">
     Suddenly the woman began to scream, with harsh and piercing cries that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55830">
     seemed to rip the very atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55850">
     [Illustration: Aiming at the base of the skull she struck.]
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55870">
     At the third scream, or the fourth, the key was turned and the door
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55880">
     jerked open.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55900">
     In its aperture, three men stood--the two who had been so long trailing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55910">
     Gabriel, and a policeman, burly, red-jowled, big-paunched.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55930">
     Gabriel stared at them. His mouth opened, then closed again without a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55940">
     word. As well for a trapped animal to make explanations to the Indian
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55950">
     hunter, as for him to tell these men the truth. The truth? _They_ knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55960">
     the truth; and they were there to crucify him. He read it in their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55970">
     cruel, eager eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_55990">
     The woman had stopped screaming now, and was weeping with abandon,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56000">
     pouring forth a tale of insults and abuse and robbery, with hysterical
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56010">
     sobs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56030">
     Full in the faces of the three men Gabriel sneered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56050">
     "You've done a good job of it, this time, you skunks!" he gibed. "I'm
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56060">
     on. You'll get me, in the end; but not just yet. The first man through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56070">
     this door gets his head broken--and that goes, too!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56090">
     With a snarl of "You damned white slaver!" the officer raised his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56100">
     night-stick and hurled himself at Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56120">
     Gabriel ducked and planted a terrific left-hander on the "bull's" ear.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56130">
     Roaring, the majesty of the law careened against the bed, crashed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56140">
     flimsy thing to wreckage and went down.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56160">
     Then, fighting back into the gloom of the trap, Gabriel engaged the two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56170">
     detectives. For a moment he held them. One went to the floor with an
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56180">
     uppercut under the chin; but came back. The other landed hard on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56190">
     Gabriel's jaw.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56210">
     He turned to strike down, again, the first of the two. He heard the bed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56220">
     creaking, and saw the policeman struggling to arise. In a whirlwind of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56230">
     blows, the second detective flailed at him, striving to beat down his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56240">
     guard and floor him with a vicious rib-jolt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56260">
     "All's fair, here!" thought Gabriel, snatching up a chair. For a moment
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56270">
     he brandished it on high. With this weapon, he knew--though final defeat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56280">
     was inevitable, when reinforcements should arrive--he could sweep a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56290">
     clear space.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56310">
     Perhaps he might even yet escape! He heard feet trampling on the stairs,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56320">
     and his heart died within him. Well, even though escape were impossible,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56330">
     he would fight to a finish and die game, if die he must!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56350">
     Down swung the chair, and round, crashing to ruin as it struck the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56360">
     policeman who was just getting to his feet again. Oaths, cries, screams
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56370">
     made the place hideous. Dust rose, and blood began to flow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56390">
     Armed now with one leg of the chair, Gabriel retreated; and as he went,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56400">
     he hurled the bitterness of all his scorn and hate upon these vile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56410">
     conspirators.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56430">
     And as he flayed them with his tongue, he struck; and like Samson
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56440">
     against the Philistines, he did great execution.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56460">
     Like Samson, too, he lost his power through a woman's treachery. For,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56470">
     even as the attackers seemed to fall back, shattered and at a loss
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56480">
     before such fury and tremendous strength, behind Gabriel the woman rose,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56490">
     a laugh of malice on her lips, the policeman's long and heavy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56500">
     night-stick in her hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56520">
     A moment she poised it, crouching as he--seeing her not--swung his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56530">
     weapon and hurled his defiance at the baffled men in front.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56550">
     Then, aiming at the base of the skull, she struck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56570">
     Sudden bright lights spangled the darkness, for Gabriel. Everything
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56580">
     whirled about, in dizzying confusion. A strange, far roaring sounded in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56590">
     his ears.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56610">
     Then he fell; and oblivion took him to its blessed peace and rest; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56620">
     all grew still and black.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56980">
     "And just pipe this, will you, too?" she exulted, holding up the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_56990">
     five-dollar bill he had given her. "And this?" She exhibited his name

     Together, the battered policeman and the detective who still had some

     room. The woman, meanwhile, stood there inhaling cigarette-smoke and

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57220">
     laughing viciously to herself.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57240">
     "You easy mutt!" she exclaimed. "Dead baby, room-rent due, wanted to get

     "Keep that lip o' yours quiet, will you, or--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57340">
     The woman stared at him a moment, then laughed insolently and snapped
    </p>

     her smoke-yellowed fingers at him in defiance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57370">
     "Mind you show up in court, in the mornin'!" panted the officer,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57380">
     staggering downstairs under the weight of Gabriel's huge shoulders.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57400">
     "Better arrest her now," suggested Caffery, "an' hold her."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57420">
     "You will, like Hell!" retorted the woman.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57440">
     "Shhh! In one door an' out the other," the second detective whispered in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57450">
     her ear, as she stood there in the doorway. "I'll see to it you get

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57460">
     fifty extra for _that_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57480">
     "Oh, if that's the game, fine business!" she smiled. "Go to it--I'm your

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57510">
     Thus it befell that, while a large and growing crowd observed, under the

     arc-light on the corner--a crowd where no fewer than six reporters, all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57530">
     duly tipped off in advance, were taking notes--Gabriel Armstrong, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57540">
     Socialist speaker and leader, was bundled, unconscious, into a patrol
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_57560">
     babbling charges of white-slave extortion and violence against him; and

     Hell, for five dollars cash in hand.
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60310">
     something seemed to have been broken, in her manner; some spring of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60320">
     action had snapped; some force was lacking now.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60340">
     "What's wrong with me?" asked Flint, trying to veil the secret malice
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60350">
     and keen satisfaction that underlay his speech. "Oh, just this. You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60360">
     remember about a week ago, when we--ah--had that little talk in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60370">
     music room--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60390">
     "Don't, father, please!" she begged, raising one strong, brown hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60400">
     "Don't bring that up again. It's all over and done with, that matter is.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60410">
     I beg you, don't re-open it!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60430">
     "I--you misunderstand me, my dear child," said Flint, trying to smile,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60440">
     but only flashing his gold tooth. "At that time I told you I was looking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60450">
     for, and would reward, if found, the--er--man who had been so brave and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60460">
     quick-witted as to rescue you. You remember?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60480">
     "Really, father, I beg you not to--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60500">
     "Why not, pray?" requested Flint, gazing at her through his pince-nez.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60510">
     "My intentions, I assure you, were most honest and philanthropic. If I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60520">
     had found him--_then_--I'd have given him--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60540">
     "Oh, but he wouldn't have taken anything, you see!" the girl
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60550">
     interrupted, with some spirit. "I told you that, at the time. It's just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60560">
     as true, now. So please, father, let's drop the question altogether."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60580">
     "I'm sorry not to be able to grant your request, my dear," said the old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60590">
     man, with hidden malice. "But really, this time, you must hear me. My

     disappointment arises from the fact that I've just discovered the young

     man's identity, and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60630">
     "You--you have?" Kate exclaimed, grasping the edge of the table with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60640">
     nervous hand. Her father smiled again, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60660">
     "Yes, I have," said he, with slow emphasis, "and I regret to say, my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60670">
     dear child, that my diagnosis of his character is precisely what I first
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60680">
     thought. Any interest you may feel in that quarter is being applied to a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60690">
     very unworthy object. The man is one of my discharged employees, a
    </p>

     thorough rascal and hard ticket in every way--one of the lowest-bred and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60710">
     most villainous persons yet unhung, I grieve to state. The fact that he

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60720">
     carried you in his arms, and that I owe your preservation to him, is one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60730">
     of the bitterest facts in my life. Had it been any other man, no matter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60740">
     of what humble birth--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60760">
     "Father!" she cried, bending forward and gazing at him with strange
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60770">
     eyes. "Father! By what right and on what authority do you make these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60780">
     accusations? That man, I know, was all that innate gentleness and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60790">
     upright manhood could make any man. His nobility was not of wealth or
    </p>

     title, but of--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60820">
     "Nonsense!" Flint interrupted. "Nobility, eh? Read _that_, will you?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60840">
     Leering, despite himself, he handed the paper across the table to his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60850">
     daughter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60870">
     "Those marked passages," said he. "And remember, this is only the
    </p>

     beginning. Wait till all the facts are known, the whole conspiracy laid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60890">
     bare and everything exposed to public view! _Then_ tell me, if you can,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60900">
     that he is poor but noble! Bah! Sunday-school dope, that! Noble, yes!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60920">
     Catherine sat there staring at the paper, a minute, as though quite
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60930">
     unable to decipher a word. Through a kind of wavering mist that seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60940">
     to swim before her eyes, she vaguely saw the words: "Socialist White
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60950">
     Slaver!" but that these bore any relation to the man she remembered,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60960">
     back there at the sugar-house, had not yet occurred to her mind. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60970">
     simply could not grasp the significance of the glaring headlines. And,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_60980">
     turning a blank gaze on her father's face, she stammered:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61000">
     "Why--why do you give me this? What has this got to do with--_me_? With

     _him_?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61030">
     "Everything!" snarled the Billionaire, violently irritated by his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61040">
     daughter's seeming obtuseness. "Everything, I tell you! That man, that

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61050">
     strong and noble hero of yours, is this man! This white slaver! This
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61060">
     wild beast--this Socialist--this Anarchist! Do you understand now, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61070">
     don't you? Do you grasp the truth at last, or is your mind incapable of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61080">
     apprehending it?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61100">
     He had risen, and now was standing there at his side of the table,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61110">
     shaking with violent emotion, his glasses awry, face wrinkled and drawn,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61120">
     hands twitching. His daughter, making no answer to his taunts, sat with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61130">
     the paper spread before her on the table. A wine glass, overset, had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61140">
     spilled a red stain--for all the world like the workers' blood, spilled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61150">
     in war and industry for the greater wealth and glory of the masters--out
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61160">
     across the costly damask, but neither she nor Flint paid any heed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61180">
     For he was staring only at her; and she, now having mastered herself a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61190">
     little, though her full breast still rose and fell too quickly, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61200">
     struggling to read the slanderous lies and foul libels of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61210">
     blue-penciled article.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61230">
     Silently she read, paling a little but otherwise giving no sign to show
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61240">
     her father how the tide of her thought was setting. Twice over she read
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61250">
     the article; then, pushing the paper back, looked at old Flint with eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61260">
     that seemed to question his very soul--eyes that saw the living truth,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61270">
     below.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61290">
     "It is a lie!" said she, at last, in a grave, quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61310">
     "What?" blurted the old man. "A--a lie?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61330">
     She nodded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61350">
     "Yes," said she. "A lie."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61370">
     Furious, he ripped open the paper, and once more shoved it at her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61390">
     "Fool!" cried he. "Read _that_!" And his shaking, big-knuckled finger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61400">
     tapped the editorial on "Socialism Unveiled."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61420">
     "No," she answered, "I need read no more. I know; I understand!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61440">
     "You--you know _what_?" choked Flint. "This is an editorial, I tell you!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61450">
     It represents the best thought and the most careful opinion of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61460">
     paper. And it condemns this man, absolutely, as a criminal and a menace
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61470">
     to society. It denounces him and his whole gang of Socialists or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61480">
     Anarchists or White-slavers--they're all the same thing--as a plague to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61490">
     the world. That's the editor's opinion; and remember, he's on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61500">
     ground, there. He has all the facts. You--_you_ are at a distance, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61510">
     have none! Yet you set up your futile, childish opinion--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61530">
     "No more, father! No more!" cried Catherine, also standing up. She faced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61540">
     him calmly, coldly, magnificently. "You can't talk to me this way, any

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61550">
     more. Cannot, and must not! As I see this thing--and my woman's

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61610">
     "Stop!" shouted the old man, in a well-assumed passion. "No daughter of
    </p>

     mine shall talk to me this way! Silence! It is monstrous and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61660">
     "No, father, not silence," she replied, with perfect poise. "Not
    </p>

     silence now, but speech. Either this thing is true or it is false. In
    </p>

     can trust is the evidence of my own senses; what I hear, and feel, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61710">
     see. So then--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61730">
     "Then?" gulped the Billionaire, holding the back of his chair in a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61740">
     trembling grasp.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61760">
     "Just this, father. I'm going to Rochester, myself, to investigate this

     thing, to see this man, to hear his side of the story, to know--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61790">
     "Do that," cried Flint in a terrible voice, "and you never enter these

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61830">
     Swept clean off his feet by rage, as well as by the deadly fear of what
    </p>

     might happen if his daughter really were to learn the truth, he had lost
    </p>

     his head completely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61870">
     With quiet attention, the girl regarded him, then smiled inscrutably.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_61890">
     "So it be," she replied. "Even though you disinherit me or turn me off

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62050">
     "No more! No more of this!" gurgled old Flint, now nearly in apoplexy.

     "I deny you! I repudiate you, Anarchist that you are! Go! Never come

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62090">

     "Father," she whispered to herself, a look of great and pure spiritual
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62150">
     beauty on her noble face, "father, this had to come. Sooner or later, it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62160">
     was inevitable. Whatever you have done, I forgive you, for you _are_ my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62170">
     father, and have surely acted for what you think my interest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62190">
     "But none the less, the end is here and now. Between you and me, a great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62200">
     gulf is fixed. And from tonight I face the world, to battle with it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62210">
     learn from it, and know the truth in every way. Enough of this false,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62220">
     easy, unnatural life. I cannot live it any longer; it would crush and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62230">
     stifle me! Enough! I must be free, I shall be free, to know, and dare,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62240">
     and do!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62260">
     That night, having had no further speech with old Flint, Kate left Idle

     Hour, taking just a few necessities in a suit-case, and a few dollars
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62280">
     for her immediate needs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62300">
     Giving no explanation to maid, valet or anyone, she let herself out,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62310">
     walked through the great estate and down Englewood Avenue, to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62320">
     station, where she caught a train for Jersey City.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62340">
     The midnight special for Chicago bore her swiftly westward. No sleeping

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62350">
     car she took, but passed the night in a seat of an ordinary coach. Her

     THROUGH STEEL BARS.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62480">
     True to her plan, Catherine ended her journey at Rochester. She engaged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62490">
     a room at a second-rate hotel--marvelling greatly at the meanness of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62500">
     accommodations, the like of which she had never seen--and, at ten
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62510">
     o'clock of the morning, appeared at the Central Police Station. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62520">
     bundle of papers in her hand indicated that she had read the latest lies
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62530">
     and venom poured out on Gabriel's defenseless head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62550">
     The haughty, full-fed sergeant in charge of the station made some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62560">
     objections, at first, to letting her see Gabriel; but the tone of her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62570">
     voice and the level look of her gray eye presently convinced him he was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62580">
     playing with fire, and he gave in. Summoning an officer, he bade the man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62590">
     conduct her. Iron doors opened and closed for her. She was conscious of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62600">
     long, ill-smelling, concrete-floored corridors, with little steel cages
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62610">
     at either side--cages where hopeless, sodden wrecks of men were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62620">
     standing, or sitting in attitudes of brutal despair, or lying on foul
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62630">
     bunks, motionless and inert as logs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62650">
     For a moment her heart failed her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62670">
     "Good Lord! Can such things be?" she whispered to herself. "So
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62680">
     this--this is a police station? And real jails and penitentiaries are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62690">
     worse? Oh, horrible! I never dreamed of anything like this, or any men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62700">
     like these!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62720">
     The officer, stopping at a cell-door and banging thereon with some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62730">
     keys, startled her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62750">
     "Here, youse," he addressed the man within, "lady to see youse!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62770">
     Catherine was conscious that her heart was pounding hard and her breath
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62780">
     coming fast, as she peered in through those cold, harsh metal bars. For
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62790">
     a minute she could find no thought, no word. Within, her eyes--still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62800">
     unaccustomed to the gloom--vaguely perceived a man's figure, big and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62810">
     powerful, and different in its bearing from those other cringing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62820">
     wretches she had glimpsed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62840">
     Then the man came toward her, stopped, peered and for a second drew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62850">
     back. And then--then she heard his voice, in a kind of startled joy:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62870">
     "Oh--is it--is it _you_?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62890">
     "Yes," she answered. "I must see you! I must talk with you, again, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62900">
     know the truth!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62920">
     The officer edged nearer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62940">
     "Youse can talk all y' want to," he dictated, hoarsely, "but don't you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62950">
     pass nothin' in. No dope, nor nothin', see? I'll stick around an' watch,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62960">
     anyhow; but don't try to slip him no dream powders or no 'snow.' 'Cause
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62970">
     if you do--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_62990">
     "What--what _on_ earth are you talking about?" the girl demanded,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63000">
     turning on the officer with absolute astonishment. But he, only winking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63010">
     wisely, repeated:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63030">
     "You heard me, didn't you? No dope. I'm wise to this whole game."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63050">
     At a loss for his meaning, yet without any real desire to fathom it,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63060">
     Kate turned back toward Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63080">
     A moment they two looked at each other, each noting any change that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63090">
     might have taken place since that wonderful hour in the sugar-house,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63100">
     each hungering and thirsting for a sight of the other's face. In her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63110">
     heart, already Kate knew as well as she knew she was alive, that this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63120">
     man was totally innocent of the foul charges heaped upon him. And so she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63130">
     looked at him with eyes wherein lay no reproach, no doubt and no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63140">
     suspicion. And, as she looked, tears started, and her heart swelled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63150">
     hotly in her breast; for he was bruised and battered and a helpless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63160">
     captive.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63180">
     "He, caged like a trapped animal!" her thought was. "He, so strong, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63190">
     free, and brave! Oh, horrible, horrible!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63210">
     He must have read something of this feeling, in her face; for now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63220">
     coming close to the bars, he said in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63240">
     "Girl--your name I don't know, even yet--girl, you mustn't pity me!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63250">
     That's _one_ thing I can't have. I'm here because the master class is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63260">
     stronger than my class, the working class. Here, because I'm dangerous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63270">
     to that master class. This isn't said to make myself out a martyr. It's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63280">
     only to make you see things right. I'm not complaining at this plight.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63290">
     I've richly earned it--under Capitalism. So, then, _that's_ settled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63310">
     "And now, what's more important, tell me how _you_ are! And did your
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63320">
     wound cause you much trouble? I confess I've passed many an anxious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63330">
     hour, thinking of your narrow escape and of your injury. It wasn't too
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63340">
     bad, was it? Tell me!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63360">
     "No," she answered, still holding to the bars, for she somehow felt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63370">
     quite unaccountably weak. "It wasn't very bad. There's hardly any scar
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63380">
     at all--or won't be, when it's fully healed. But all this is trifling,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63390">
     compared to what _you've_ suffered and are suffering. Oh, what a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63400">
     horrible affair! What frightful accusations! Tell me the truth,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63410">
     Boy--how, why could--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63430">
     He looked at her a moment, in silence, noting her splendid hair and eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63440">
     and mouth, the firm, well-moulded chin, the confident and self-reliant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63450">
     poise of the shapely head; and as he looked, he knew he loved this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63460">
     woman. He understood, at last, how dear she was to him--dearer than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63470">
     anything else in all the world save just his principles and stern life
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63480">
     work. He comprehended the meaning of all, his dreams and visions and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63490">
     long thoughts. And, caring nothing for consequences, unskilled in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63500">
     finesse of dealing with women, acting wholly on the irresistible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63510">
     impulses of a heart that overflowed, he looked deep into those gray eyes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63520">
     and said in a tone that set her heart-strings vibrating:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63540">
     "Listen! The truth? How could I tell you anything else? I know not who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63550">
     you are, and care not. That you are rich and powerful and free, while I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63560">
     am poor and in captivity, means nothing. Love cares not for such
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63570">
     trifles. It dares all, hopes all, trusts all, believes all--and is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63580">
     patient in adversity."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63600">
     "Love?" she whispered, her face paling. "How do you dare to--?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63620">
     "Dare? Because my heart bids me. And where it bids, I care not for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63630">
     conventions or consequences!" He flung his hand out with a splendid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63640">
     gesture, his head high, his eyes lustrous in the half-light of the cell.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63650">
     "Where it leads, I have to follow. That is why I am a Socialist! That is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63660">
     why I am here, today, outcast and execrated, a prisoner, in danger of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63670">
     long years of living death in the pestilential tomb of some foul
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63680">
     penitentiary!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63700">
     "You're here because--because you are a Socialist?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63720">
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63740">
     "Yes," said he. "I tried to help a suffering, outcast woman--or one who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63750">
     posed as such. And she betrayed me to my enemies. And so--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63770">
     "There _was_ a woman in this affair, then?" Catherine queried with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63780">
     sudden pain. "The newspapers haven't made the story _all_ up out of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63790">
     whole cloth?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63810">
     "No. There _was_ a woman. A Delilah, who delivered me into the hands of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63820">
     the Philistines, when I tried to help her in what she lied in telling me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63830">
     was her need. Will you hear the story?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63850">
     Still very pale, she formed a half-inarticulate "Yes!" with her full
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63860">
     lips. Then, seeming to brace herself by a tighter clasp on the hard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63870">
     steel grating, she listened while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63890">
     Earnestly, honestly and with perfect straightforwardness, omitting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63900">
     nothing, adding nothing, he gave her the narrative of that fatal night's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63910">
     events, from the first moment he had laid eyes on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63920">
     wonderfully-disguised woman, till her cudgel-blow had laid him senseless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63930">
     on the floor.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63950">
     He told her the part that every actor therein had played; how the whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63960">
     drama had been staged, to dishonor and convict him, to railroad him to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63970">
     the Pen for a long term, perhaps to kill him. He spoke in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63980">
     to prevent the watching officer from overhearing; and as he talked, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_63990">
     thanked his stars that in all this network of conspiracy and crime
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64000">
     against the Party and against himself, his captors had not yet placed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64010">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64020">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64030">
     unfairness or of martyrizing him--this restriction had not yet been laid
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64040">
     upon him. So now his message of the truth could reach the ears of her

     who, more than all the world beside, had grown dear to him and precious

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64090">
     had since happened--the newspaper attacks on him and on the Party; the

     the struggle to fix a foul and lasting blot upon his name, and ruin him

     beyond redemption.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64140">
     "And why, all this?" he added, while she--listening so intently that she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64150">
     hardly breathed--knew that he spoke the living, vital truth. "Why this
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_64160">
     persecution, this plotting, this labor and expense to 'get' me. Do you

     Their hands parted. Gabriel, still silent, stood there in his cell,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_65950">
     watching her till she vanished from his sight down the long corridor of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_65960">
     grief and tears. The officer, winking wisely to himself, thrust his

     tongue into his cheek.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_65990">
     "Daughter of Isaac Flint, th' Billionaire!" he was thinking, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66000">
     derision. "Oh, yes, billionaires' daughters would be visitin' Socialists

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66040">
     Which mental attitude was fortunate, indeed; for it, and it alone,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66050">
     preserved the girl from a wild blare of newspaper notoriety. Had the

     truth been known, who could have imagined the results?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66080">
     For a long time after the girl had departed, Gabriel sat there in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66090">
     cell, motionless and sunk in deepest thought. His emotions passed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66100">
     recording. That this woman, his ideal, his best-beloved, the cherished,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66110">
     inmost treasure of his heart and soul--she whom he had rescued, she who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66120">
     had lain in his arms and shared with him that unforgettable hour in the

     old sugar-house--should now prove to be the daughter of his bitterest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66140">
     enemy, surpassed belief and stunned all clear understanding.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66160">
     Flint! The very name connoted, for Gabriel, all that was cruel and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66170">
     rapacious, hateful, vicious and greedy; all that meant pain and woe and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66180">
     death to him and his class. Visions of West Virginia and Colorado rose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66190">
     before his mind. He heard again the whistle of the "Bull Moose Death
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66200">
     Special" as it sped on its swift errand of barbarism up Cabin Creek,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66210">
     hurling its sprays of leaden death among the slaves of this man and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66220">
     vulturine associates.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66240">
     Flint! He whispered the name; and now he seemed to see the burning tents

     at Ludlow; the fleeing women and children, shot down by barbarous thugs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66260">
     and gunmen, ghouls in human form! He saw the pits of death, where the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66270">
     charred bodies of innocent victims of greed and heartless rapacity lay
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66280">
     in mute protest under the far Colorado sky. And more he saw, east and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66290">
     west, north and south, of this man's inhuman work; and his thoughts,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66300">
     projected into the future, dwelt bitterly on the Air Trust now already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66310">
     under way--the terrible, coming slavery which he, Gabriel, had struggled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66320">
     to checkmate, only to find himself locked like a rat in a steel trap!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66340">
     "And this woman," he groaned in agony of soul, "this woman, all in all

     to me, is--is _his_ daughter!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66370">
     Flinging himself upon his hard and narrow bunk, he buried his head in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66380">
     his powerful arms, and tried to blot out thought from his fevered brain;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66390">
     but still the current ran on and on and on, endlessly, maddeningly. And
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66400">
     to the problem, no answer seemed to come.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66420">
     "She must know who I am," he pondered. "Even if her father has not told
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66430">
     her, the papers have. True, she doesn't believe the infamous charge
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66440">
     against me; but what then? Can she, on the other hand, believe the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66450">
     truth, that her father has conspired with Slade and those Cosmos thugs,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66460">
     and with the press and courts and the whole damnable prostituted system,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66470">
     to suppress and kill me?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66490">
     "Can she believe her father guilty of all that? And of all the horrors
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66500">
     of this capitalist Hell, that I have told her about? No! Human nature is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66510">
     incapable of such vast turnings from all the habits and environments of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66520">
     a lifetime. In her veins flows the blood of that arch-criminal, Flint.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66530">
     Her thoughts must be, to some extent, his thoughts. She must share his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66540">
     viewpoint, and be loyal to him. After this first flush of reaction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66550">
     against her father, she will go back to him. It is inevitable. Betwixt
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66560">
     her and me is fixed a boundless space, wider than Heaven and earth. She
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66570">
     is one pole, and I the other. If I have any strength or resolution or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66580">
     philosophy, now is the hour for its trial.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66600">
     "This woman must be, shall be put away from every thought and wish and

     chapter where our life-stories seem to have run along together in a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66650">
     Thus pondered Gabriel, in the gloom of his harsh cell, branded with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66660">
     crime and writhing in the agony of soul that only those who love
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66670">
     hopelessly can ever know.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66690">
     And Catherine, what of her? What were her thoughts, emotions,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66700">
     inspirations as--seeming to live in a dream, with Gabriel's eloquence
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66710">
     and the new vision of a better, saner, kindlier world shining through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66720">
     her soul--she made her way back to the dingy hotel where now, shabby as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66730">
     it was, she felt she had no right to stay, while others, homeless,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66740">
     walked the brutal streets?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66760">
     Who shall know them? Who shall tell? A blind man, suddenly made to see,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66770">
     can find no words to express the wonder and bright glory of that sudden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66780">
     sight. A deaf man, regaining his lost sense, cannot describe the sudden
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66790">
     burst of sound that fills the new, strange world wherein he finds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66800">
     himself. So, now, this cultured, gently bred woman, for the first time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66810">
     in her life understanding the facts, glimpsing the tragedy and grasping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66820">
     the answer to it all, felt that no words could compass her strange

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66830">
     exultation and enlargement.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66850">
     "It--it's like a chrysalis emerging into the form of a light, swift

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66870">
     to write two letters. "Just for the present, I can't understand it all.

     that company of earnest, noble men and women striving for life and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66900">
     liberty and joy for all the world. But with the help of the man I trust
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_66910">

     She thought, a few minutes more, her face lighted by an inner radiance

     My Dear Wally:

    </p>

    </p>

     After having read this over and sealed it, she wrote still another:

     in the August glare. As he removed his cheap, convict-made cap, one saw

     his finely shaped head, close cropped with the infamous prison badge of
    </p>

     servitude. Despite the shoddy miserable prison-suit that the prostituted
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_68770">

     "I knew you'd come, Catherine," said he, simply, his voice still the

     Gabriel had met them all with calm self-reliance and with a generalship

    </p>

     after his drowsiness and weird dreams had convinced him of the plot, had
    </p>

     turned the trick on it by secretly emptying this water out and by

     unshaken and with a woman by his side who shared his high ambition and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69430">
     She nodded, smiling. Smiles were rare with her, now. She had grown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69440">
     sober and serious, in these years of work and battle and stern endeavor.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69450">
     The Catherine Flint of the old times had vanished--the Catherine of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69460">
     country club days, and golf and tennis, and the opera--the Catherine of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69470">
     Newport, of the horse show, of Paris, of "society." In her place now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69480">
     lived another and a nobler woman, a woman known and loved the length and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69490">
     breadth of the land, a woman exalted and strengthened by new, high and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69500">
     splendid race-aspirations; by a vision of supernal beauty--the vision of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69510">
     the world for the workers, each for all and all for each!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69530">
     She had grown more mature and beautiful, with the passing years. No mark
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69540">
     of time had yet laid its hand upon her face or figure. Young, still--she
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69550">
     was now but five-and-twenty, and Gabriel only twenty-eight--she walked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69560">
     like a goddess, lithe, strong and filled with overflowing vigor. Her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69570">
     eyes glowed with noble enthusiasms; and every thought, every impulse and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69580">
     endeavor now was upward, onward, filled with stimulus and hope and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69590">
     courage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69610">
     Thus, a braver, broader and more splendid woman than Gabriel had known
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69620">
     in the other days of his first love for her--the days when he had wished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69630">
     her penniless, the days when her prospective millions stood between
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69640">
     them--she walked beside him now. And they two, comrades, understood each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69650">
     other; spoke the same language, shared the same aspirations, dreamed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69660">
     same wondrous dreams. Their smile, as their eyes met, was in itself a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69670">
     benediction and a warm caress.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69690">
     "Charge the forts!" Gabriel repeated. "Yes, Kate, the battle still goes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69700">
     on, no matter what happens. Here and there, soldiers fall and die. Even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69710">
     battalions perish; but the war continues. When I think of all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69720">
     fights you've been in, since I was put away, I'm unspeakably envious.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69730">
     You've been through the Tawana Valley strike, the big Consolidated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69740">
     Western lockout and the Imperial Mills massacre. You were a delegate to

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69770">
     barricades. Then, out in California--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69790">
     She checked him, with a hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69810">
     "Please don't, Gabriel," she entreated. "What I have done has been so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69820">
     little, so terribly, pitiably little, compared to what _needs_ to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69830">
     done! And then remember, too, that in and through all, this thought has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69840">
     run, like the red thread through every cable of the British navy--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69850">
     thought that in my every activity, I am working against my own father,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69860">
     combatting him, being as it were a traitor and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69880">
     "Traitor?" exclaimed the man. "Never! The bond between you two is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69890">
     forever broken. You recognize in him, now, an enemy of all mankind.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_69900">
     Waldron is another. So is every one of the Air Trust group--that is to

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70040">
     He paused and looked at her. They had now reached a little park, some
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70050">
     half mile from the grim and dour old walls of the Federal Pen. Trees and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70060">
     grass and playing children seemed to invite them to stop and rest.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70070">
     Though strong, moreover, Gabriel had for so long been unused to walking,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70080">
     that even this short distance had tired him a little. And the oppressive
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70090">
     heat had them both by the throat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70110">
     "Shall we sit down here and wait a little?" asked he. "Plan a little,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70120">
     see where we are and what's to be done next?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70140">
     She nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70160">
     "Of course," she said, "even if I could have got word in to you, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70170">
     wouldn't have given you our real plans."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70190">
     "Hardly!" he exclaimed. Then, coming to a fountain, they sat down on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70200">
     bench close by. Nobody, they made sure, was within ear-shot.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70220">
     "Thank God," he breathed, "that you, Kate, and only you, met me as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70230">
     came out! It was a grand good idea, wasn't it, to keep my time of

     crowd on hand, and various kinds of foolishness; and time and energy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70260">
     would have been used that might have been better spent in working for

     the Revolution!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70290">
     She looked at him a trifle curiously.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70310">
     "You forget," said she, "that all public meetings have been prohibited,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70320">
     ever since last April. Federal statute--the new Penfield Bill--'The

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70350">
     "That's so!" he murmured. "I forgot. Fact is, Kate, I _am_ out of touch
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70360">
     with things. While you've been fighting, I've been buried alive. Now, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70370">
     must learn much, before I can jump back into the war again. And above
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70380">
     all, I must lose my identity. That's the first and most essential thing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70390">
     of all!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70410">
     "Of course," she assented. "They--the Air Trust World-corporation--will
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70420">
     trail you, everywhere you go. All this, as you know, has been provided
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70430">
     for. You must vanish a while."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70450">
     "Indeed I must. If they 'jobbed' me like that, in 1921, what won't they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70460">
     do now in 1925?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70480">
     "They won't ever get you, again, Gabriel," she answered, "if your wits
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70490">
     and ours combined, can beat them. True, the Movement has been badly shot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70500">
     to pieces. That is, its visible organization has suffered, and it's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70510">
     outlawed. But under the surface, Gabriel, you haven't an idea of its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70520">
     spread and power. It's tremendous--it's a volcano waiting to burst! Let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70530">
     the moment come, the leader rise, the fire burst forth, and God knows

     what may not happen!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70560">
     "Splendid!" exclaimed Gabriel. "The battle calls me, like a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70570">
     clarion-call! But we must act with circumspection. The Plutes, powerful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70580">
     as they now are, won't need even the shadow of an excuse to plant me for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70590">
     life, or slug or shoot me. Things were rotten enough, then; but today
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70600">
     they're worse. The hand of this Air Trust monopoly, grasping every line
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70610">
     of work and product in the world, has got the lid nailed fast. We're all

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70670">
     of grace, 1925, is worse than ever I dreamed it would be. Oh, infinitely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70680">
     worse! No wonder our movement has been driven largely underground. No
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70690">
     wonder that the war of mass and class is drawing near--the actual,

     stifling world!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70730">
     She nodded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70750">
     "Yes," said she, "it's coming, and soon. Things are as you say, and even
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70760">
     worse than you say, Gabriel. I know more of them, now, than you can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70770">
     know. Remember London's 'Iron Heel?' When I first read it I thought it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70780">
     fanciful and wild. God knows I was mistaken! London didn't put it half
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70790">
     strongly enough. The beginning was made when the National Mounted Police
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70800">
     came in. All the rest has swiftly followed. If you and I live five years
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70810">
     longer, Gabriel, we'll see a harsher, sterner and more murderous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70820">
     trampling of that Heel than ever Comrade Jack imagined!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70840">
     "Right!" said he. "And for that very reason, Kate, I've got to go into

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70850">
     hiding till my beard and hair grow and I can reappear as a different

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70890">
     couldn't spot them, but I could. One was that Italian banana-seller that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70900">
     stood at the curb, on the first corner. Another was a taxi driver. And

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70910">
     this one, over there, is the third. From now till they 'get' me again,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70920">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70930">
     take part in the impending war, till I shake them. Look, now, do you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70940">
     see the one I mean?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70960">
     Cautiously the girl looked round, with casual glance as though to see a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70970">
     little boy playing by the fountain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_70990">
     "Yes," she murmured. "Who is he? Do you know his name?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71010">
     "No," answered Gabriel. "His name, no. But I remember him, well enough.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71020">
     He's the larger of the two detectives I knocked out, in that room in

     Rochester. Beside his pay, he's got a personal motive in landing me back

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71050">
     penitentiary and a death. So then," he added, "what's the first thing?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71060">
     Where shall I go, and how, to hide and metamorphose? I'm in your hands,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71070">
     now, Kate. More than four years out of the world, remember, makes a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71100">
     She smiled and nodded comprehension.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71120">
     "Don't explain, Gabriel," said she. "I understand. And I've got just the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71140">
     we've been planning on this release. When can you go?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71160">
     "When? Right now!" exclaimed Gabriel, standing up. "The quicker, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71170">
     better. Every minute I lose in getting myself ready to jump back into

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71180">
     the fight, is a precious treasure that can never be regained!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71200">
     "Go, then," said she, with pride in her eyes. "I will wait here. Don't

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71280">
     "Register, under my own name?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71300">
     "Under your own name. Stay there two days. You won't be molested so

     "Well, what then?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71360">
     "A message will come for you, that's all. Obey it. You have nothing more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71370">
     to do."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71390">
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71410">
     "I understand," said he. "But, Kate--who's paying for all this? Not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71420">
     _you_? I--I can't have _you_ paying, now that every dollar you have must

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71450">
     She smiled a smile of wonderful beauty.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71470">
     "Foolish, rebellious boy!" said she. "Have no fear! All expense will be
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71510">
     were buried alive in a cell. Even though in some ways outlawed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71520">

     electric spark to cause the world-shaking explosion. All that keeps us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71540">
     from power now is the Iron Heel--that, and the clutch of the Air Trust

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71570">
     "Go, now," she concluded. "Go, and rest a while, and wait. All shall be

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71620">
     "And shall I see you soon, again?" he asked, his voice trembling just a

     little as their hands clasped once more, and once more parted.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71650">
     "You will see me soon," she answered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71670">
     "Where?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71690">
     "In a safe place, where we can plan, and work, and organize for the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71720">
     One last look each gave the other. Their eyes met, more caressingly than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71730">
     many a kiss; and, turning, Gabriel took his way, alone, toward

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71740">
     Desplaines Street.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71760">
     At the exit of the park, he looked around.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71780">
     There Catherine sat, on the bench. But, seemingly quite oblivious to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71790">
     everything, she was now reading a little book. Though he lingered a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71800">
     moment, hoping to get some signal from her, she never stirred or looked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71810">
     up from the page.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71830">
     Sighing, with a strange feeling of sudden loneliness and a vast, empty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71840">
     yearning in his heart, Gabriel continued on his way, toward what? He

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71850">
     knew not.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71870">
     The detective on the other side of the park, no longer sat there.

     IN THE REFUGE.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71970">
     Far on the western slopes of Clingman Dome in the great Smoky Mountains
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71980">
     of North Carolina, a broad, low-built bungalow stood facing the setting

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_71990">
     sun. Vast stretches of pine forest shut it off from civilization and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72000">
     prying activities of Plutocracy. The nearest settlement was Ravens,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72010">
     twenty miles away to eastward, across inaccessible ridges and ravines.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72020">
     Running far to southward, the railway left this wilderness untouched.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72030">
     High overhead, an eagle soared among the "thunder-heads" that presaged a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72040">
     storm up Sevier Pass. And, red through the haze to westward, the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72050">
     huge sunball slid down the heavens toward the tumbled, jagged mass of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72060">
     peaks that rimmed the far horizon.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72080">
     Within the bungalow, a murmur of voices sounded; and from the huge stone

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72090">
     chimney a curl of smoke, arising, told of the evening meal, within, now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72100">
     being made ready. On the wide piazza sat a man, writing at a table of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72110">
     plain boards roughly pegged together. Still a trifle pale, yet with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72120">
     look of health and vigor, he sat there hard at work, writing as fast as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72130">
     pen could travel. Hardly a word he changed. Sheet by sheet he wrote, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72140">
     pushed them aside and still worked on. Some of the pages slid to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72150">
     porch-floor, but he gave no heed. His brow was wrinkled with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72160">
     intensity of his thought; and over his face, where now a disguising
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72170">
     beard was beginning to be visible, the light of the sinking sun cast as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72180">
     it were a kind of glowing radiance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72200">
     At last the man looked up, and smiled, and eyed the golden mountain-tops
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72210">
     far off across the valley.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72230">
     "Wonderful aerie in the hills!" he murmured. "Wonderful retreat and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72240">
     hiding-place--wonderful care and forethought to have made this possible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72250">
     for me! How shall I ever repay all this? How, save by giving my last
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72260">
     drop of blood, if need be, for the final victory?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72280">
     He pondered a moment, still half-thinking of the poem he had just
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72290">
     finished, half-reflecting on the strange events of the past week--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72300">
     secret ways, by swift auto, by boat, by monoplane which had brought him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72310">
     hither to this still undiscovered refuge. How had it all been arranged,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72320">
     he wondered; and who had made it possible? He could not tell, as yet. No
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72330">
     information was forthcoming. But in his heart he understood, and his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72340">
     lips, murmuring the name of Catherine, blessed that name and tenderly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72350">
     revered it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72370">
     At last Gabriel bent, picked up the pages that had fallen, and arranged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72380">
     them all in order.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72400">
     "Tomorrow this shall go out to the world," said he, "and to our
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72410">
     press--such of it as still remains. It may inspire some fainting heart
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72420">
     and thrill some lagging mind. Now, that the final struggle is at hand,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72430">
     more than guns we need inspiration. More than force, to meet the force
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72440">
     that has ravished our every right and crushed Constitution and Law,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72450">
     alike, we need spiritual insight and integrity. Only through these, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72460">
     by these, come what may, can a true, lasting victory be attained!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72480">
     In the doorway of the bungalow a woman appeared, her smile illumined by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72490">
     the sunset warmth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72510">
     "Come, Gabriel," said she. "We're waiting--the Granthams, Craig, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72520">
     Brevard. Supper's ready. Not one of them will sit down, till you come."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72540">
     "Have I been delaying you?" asked Gabriel, turning toward the woman,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72550">
     with a smile that matched her own.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72570">
     "I'm afraid so, just a little," she answered. "But no matter; I'm glad.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72580">
     When you get to writing, you know, nothing else matters. One line of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72590">
     your verse is worth all the suppers in the world."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72610">
     "Nonsense!" he retorted. "I'm a mere scribbler!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72630">
     "We won't argue that point," she answered. "But at any rate, you're
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72640">
     done, now. So come along, boy--or the comrades will begin 'dividing up'
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72650">
     without us; for this mountain air won't brook delay."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72670">
     Gabriel took a long breath, stretched his powerful arms out toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72680">
     mountains, and raised his face to the last light of day.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72700">
     "Nature!" he whispered. "Ever beautiful and ever young! Ah, could man
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72710">
     but learn thy lessons and live close to thy great heart!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72730">
     Then, turning, he followed Catherine into the bungalow.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72750">
     Beautiful and restful though the outside was, the interior was more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72760">
     restful and more charming still.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72780">
     In the vast fireplace, to left, a fire of pine roots was crackling. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72790">
     room was filled with their pitchy, wholesome perfume, with the dancing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72800">
     light of their blaze and with the warmth made grateful by that mountain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72810">
     height.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72830">
     Simple and comfortable all the furnishings were, hand-wrought for use
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72840">
     and pleasure. Big chairs invited. Broad couches offered rest. No
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72850">
     hunting-trophies, no heads of slaughtered wild things disfigured the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72860">
     walls, as in most bungalows; but the flickering firelight showed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72870">
     pictures that inspired thought and carried lessons home--pictures of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72880">
     toil and of repose, pictures of life, and love, and simple joy--pictures
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_72890">
     of tragedy, of reality and deep significance. Here one saw Millet's

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_73110">
     Gabriel laughed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_73130">
     "Your own fault, if you wait for me," he answered, seating himself. "You

     the meal was over.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_73390">
     "Dessert, now, Gabriel!" exclaimed Grantham. "Your turn!"

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_73500">
     "You really want to hear this?" he demanded. "If you can possibly spare

     The dry-breasted mothers, the dirt, disease and ignorance,

     Sober, serious, full of dispassionate and prophetic vision,

     Not like the other men, the all-wise Leaders of the People.

     The political economists, the professors, the militarists, heroes

     Listened to the surging music, saw all the lights and flowers,

     Flowers and lights and crystal cups, whereof the price for each

     starving baby.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74010">
     I heard the Leaders' speeches, the turgid oratory,

     The well-turned phrases of the Captains, the rotund babble of

     prosperity,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74040">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74050">
     The Captains' vaunting I heard, their boasts of glory and victory,

     butchered workers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74080">
     I heard the Judges' self-glorification, Quixotic fighting of

     windmills,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74100">
     Heard also the unclean jests that those respected Leaders told.

     Unmoved and patient and serious, calm, full of sober reflections.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74140">
     Then there spake (among many others) an honored and full-paunched

     Bishop.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74160">

     descended.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74200">
     I heard this exponent of Christ the Crucified, Christ the Carpenter,

     graft-brood of usurers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74270">
     And the rotund Bishop's words were as the crackling of dry thorns

     platitudes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74300">
     The story he told was spiced and garnished with profane words,

     merriment,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74330">
     So that the banquet-hall rang, and wine was spilt on the linen.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74340">
     Wine as red as blood--the blood of the shattered miner,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74390">
     And still I watched the Socialist. Sober, judicial, observant

     Leaders.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_74420">

     As Gabriel's voice fell to silence, after the last words, a stillness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_75010">
     came upon the lamp-lit room, a hush broken only by the snapping of the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_76510">
     Gabriel thought, a moment, before replying. Then said he:

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_76530">
     "I know it, Craig. All the more reason why we must hit them at once, and

     remember, nor is it any small, compact European country. Conditions are

     A little silence. Then said Catherine:

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_76770">
     He nodded, with a smouldering fire in his eyes.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_76790">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_76940">
     Into each others' eyes they looked, and knew the moment of final
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77130">
     Brevard was the first to speak. "Gabriel," said he, "we have agreed that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77140">
     you must be the leader in this whole affair. The actual, personal

     of us men. Your executive ability is, without any question whatever, far
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77170">
     and away ahead of ours--for we are more in the analytical, compiling,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77180">
     organizing, preparing line. To cap all, your personality carries more,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77190">
     far more, with the mass of the comrades than any of ours. Your career,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77200">
     in the past, your conflict with Flint and Waldron, and your long
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77210">
     imprisonment, have given you the necessary following. You, and you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77220">
     alone, must issue the final call, lead the last, supreme attack, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77230">
     carry the old flag, the Crimson Banner of Brotherhood, to the topmost

     battlement of an annihilated Capitalism!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77260">
     Gabriel demurred, but they overruled him. So, presently, he consented;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77270">
     and pledged his life to it; and thrilled with pride and joy at thought
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77280">
     of what now lay written in the Book of Fate, for him to read.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77300">
     Catherine's eyes shone with a strange light, as she looked upon him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77310">
     there, so modest yet so strong. And he, smiling a little as his gaze met
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77320">
     hers, foresaw other things than war, and was glad. His heart sang within
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77330">
     him, that memorable and wondrous night, up there in the hiding-place
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77340">
     among the Great Smokies--there with Catherine and the other
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77350">
     comrades--there planning the last great blow to strike away forever the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77360">
     shackles from the bleeding limbs of all the human race!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77380">
     But serious and urgent things were to be thought of, and at once, for on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77390">
     the morrow Brevard was going down, disguised, to Louisville, in one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77400">
     the two monoplanes, to attend a final secret meeting of the North-middle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77410">
     Section Committee. From this he would proceed to the refuge near Port
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77420">
     Colborne, Ontario.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77440">
     "Let us make that our meeting-place, one week from tonight," said
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77450">
     Gabriel, "in case anything happens. Should we be detected, or should any
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77460">
     accident befall, we must have some time and place to rally by. Is my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77470">
     suggestion taken?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77490">
     They all agreed, after some discussion.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77510">
     "But," added Mrs. Grantham, "let's hope we're still secure here, for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77520">
     while. It doesn't seem possible they could find us _here_, in this broad
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77530">
     mountain wilderness!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77550">
     Brevard, meanwhile, was spreading out diagrams and plans.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77570">
     "The plant at Niagara," said he. "Gabriel, study this, now, as you never
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77580">
     yet have studied anything! For on your intimate knowledge of these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77590">
     plans--which, by the way, have been obtained only at the cost of eight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77600">
     lives of our comrades, and through adventures which alone would make a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77610">
     wonderful book--depends everything. With all communications cut, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77620">
     troops kept away, and our own people storming the works, you will yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77630">
     fail, Gabriel, unless you know every building, every courtyard, wall and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77640">
     passage, every door and window, almost, I might say. For the place is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77650">
     more than a manufacturing plant. It's a fortress, a city in itself, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77660">
     wonderful, gigantic center to the whole web of world-domination!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77680">
     "So now, to the plans!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77700">
     For hours, while Gabriel took notes and listened keenly, asked questions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77710">
     and made minute memoranda, Brevard explained the situation at the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77720">
     Air Trust works. The others looked on, listened, and from time to time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77730">
     made suggestions; but for the most part they kept silent, unwilling to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77740">
     disturb this most important work.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77760">
     Carefully and with painstaking accuracy he showed Gabriel how the plant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77770">
     now embraced more than two square miles of territory around the Falls,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77780">
     all guarded by tremendous barricades mounting machine-guns and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77790">
     search-lights. On both sides of the river this huge monster had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77800">
     squatted, effectually shutting out all sight of the Falls and depriving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77810">
     the people of their birthright of beauty, at the same time that it had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77820">
     harnessed the vast waterpower to the task of enslaving the world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_77840">
     "From the Grand Trunk steel arch bridge up to and including the former

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78340">
     "Oh, devilish and infernal plot against the world!" said Gabriel,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78350">
     bitterly. "Yet in essence, after all, no different from the system of

     He paused, suddenly, as Kate laid a hand on his arm.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78440">
     "Hark! What's that?" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78460">
     Outside, somewhere, a sound had made itself heard. Then on the porch, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78470">
     loose board creaked.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78490">
     Gabriel sprang to his feet. The others stood up and faced the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78510">
     "In heaven's name, what's that outside?" demanded Craig.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78530">
     On the instant, a heavy foot crashed through the panels of their door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78540">
     The door, burst open, flew back.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78560">
     In the aperture, stood a man, in aviator's dress, with another dimly

     Quick as thought, at sound of the imperative summons and sight of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78750">
     levelled weapons, Gabriel swept up most of the papers and crammed them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78760">
     into the breast of his loose flannel shirt, then dashed the lamp to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78770">
     floor, extinguishing it. The room grew dark, for now the fire had burned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78780">
     down to hardly more than glowing coals.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78800">
     There was no panic; the men did not curse, neither did the women scream.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78810">
     As though the tactic had already been agreed on, Craig tipped the table
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78820">
     up, making a kind of barricade; and over it Grantham's revolver,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78830">
     snatched from his belt, spat viciously.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78850">
     It all happened in a moment.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78870">
     The foremost spy grunted, coughed and plunged forward. As he fell, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78880">
     fired his terrible weapon.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78900">
     The bullet--a small, thin metal shell, filled with a secret chemical and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78910">
     liquid oxygen--went wild. It struck the wall, some feet to the left of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78920">
     the fireplace, and instantly the wood burst into vivid flame. Flesh
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78930">
     would crisp to nothing, solid stone would crumble, metal would gutter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78940">
     and run down, under that awful incandescence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78960">
     Again Grantham's revolver barked, while Bevard tugged at his own, which
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78970">
     had unaccountably got stuck in its holster. But this second shot missed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78980">
     And even as Grantham's bullet snicked a long splinter from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_78990">
     door-jamb, the second spy fired.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79010">
     Brevard's choking cry died as the gushing flame enveloped him. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79020">
     staggered, flung up both arms and fell stone dead, the life seared clean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79030">
     out of him, as a lamp sears a moth.
    </p>

     the room now glowed with this unquenchable blossoming of flame--Grantham

     shot.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79090">
     The spy's body burst into a sheaf of fire. Up past the lintel streamed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79100">
     the burning swirl. Mute and annihilated, his charred body dropped beside
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79110">
     that of his mate.

     The total time from challenge to complete victory had not exceeded ten

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79160">
     "I exploded some of his cartridges!" choked Grantham. shielding his wife
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79170">
     from the glare, while Gabriel protected Catherine.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79190">
     "His--his cartridge belt!" gasped Craig.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79210">
     "Yes! And now, out--out of here!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79230">
     "Brevard? We must save his body!" cried Gabriel, pointing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79250">
     "Impossible!" shouted Grantham. "That hellish compound will burn for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79260">
     hours! And in three minutes this whole place will be a roaring furnace!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79270">
     Out of here--out--away! We must save the hangar, at all hazards!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79290">
     Against their will, but absolutely unable to approach the now

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79300">
     wildly-roaring fire on the floor that marked the spot where Brevard had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79310">
     fallen in the Battle with Plutocracy, the comrades quickly retreated.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79330">
     Raging fire now hemmed them on three sides. Their only avenue of escape
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79340">
     was through the eastern windows, eight or ten feet above the ground.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79350">
     Hastily snatching up such of the plans and papers as he had not already

     secured--and some of these already were beginning to smoke and turn
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79370">
     brown, in the infernal heat--Gabriel shielded Catherine's retreat. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79380">
     others followed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79400">
     Craig and Grantham first jumped from the windows, then caught Mrs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79410">
     Grantham and Catherine as Gabriel helped them to escape. He himself was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79420">
     the last to leave the room, now a raging furnace. Together they all ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79430">
     from the building, and none too soon; for suddenly the roof collapsed, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79440">
     tremendous burst of crackling flames and sheaved sparks leaped high
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79450">
     above the tree-tops, and the walls came crashing in.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79470">
     In the welter of incandescence, where now only the stone chimney
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79480">
     stood--and this, too, was already cracking and swaying--Brevard had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79490">
     found his tomb, together with the two Air Trust spies. All that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79500">
     pleasant, necessary place was now a mass of white-hot ruin; all those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79510">
     books and pictures now had turned to ash.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79530">
     The five remaining comrades paused by the hangar, and looked mournfully
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79540">
     back at the still-leaping volcano of destruction.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79560">
     "Poor Brevard! Poor old chap!" said Craig. He peered at the women.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79570">
     Neither one was crying--they were not that type--but both were pale.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79590">
     "I don't feel that way," said Gabriel. "Brevard is not to be pitied.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79600">
     He's to be envied! He died in the noblest war we can conceive--the war
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79610">
     for the human race! And his last act was to take part in a battle that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79620">
     stamped out two vipers, Air Trust spies, who would have joyed to burn us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79630">
     all alive!"

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79670">
     "Thank God, I got the Hell-hounds!" muttered Craig. "Two less of Slade's

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79680">
     infamous army, anyhow." Though Gabriel knew it not, the first one to

     fall was the same who had battled with him in the trap at Rochester, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79700">
     same who had trailed him when he, Gabriel, had left the Federal pen. So
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79710">
     one score, at least, was settled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79730">
     "They're gone, anyhow," said Gabriel, "and five of us still live--and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79740">
     I've still got the plans and all. Moreover, the monoplanes are safe. The

     A frightful shock awaited them when, entering the hangar--eager now to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79800">
     escape at once from the scene of the tragedy--they beheld their
    </p>

     aeroplanes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79830">
     By the ruddy light which shone in through the wide doors, from the fire,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79840">
     they saw long strips and tatters of canvas hanging from the 'planes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79860">
     "Smashed! Broken! Wrecked!" cried Gabriel, starting back aghast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79880">
     The others stared. Only too true; the monoplanes were practically
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79890">
     destroyed. Not only had the spies, before attacking the refuge, slashed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79900">
     the 'planes to rags, but they had also partly dismantled the motors.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79910">
     Bits of machinery lay scattered on the floor of the hangar.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79930">
     Stunned and unable to gather speech or coherent thought, the five
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79940">
     Socialists stood staring. Then, after a moment, Craig made shift to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79950">
     exclaim bitterly:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79970">
     "A good job, all right! The curs must have got in at the window, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79980">
     spent an hour in this work. Whatever happened, they didn't intend we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_79990">
     should have any means of retreat--for of course it's out of the question
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80000">
     for anybody to get away from here through the forest over the ridges
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80010">
     and down the cliffs!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80030">
     "They meant to trap us, this way, that's certain," added Gabriel. "There
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80040">
     surely will be others of the same breed, here before morning. They must

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80050">
     not find us here!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80070">
     "But Gabriel, how shall we escape?" asked Catherine, her face illumined
    </p>

     The little party hurried off toward the landing-ground, a cleared and

     "Two, and a passenger," repeated Gabriel, as though echoing Craig's

     words. "Who goes first?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80360">
     "You!" said Grantham. "You and Catherine, with Craig to bring the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80420">
     A spirited argument followed. Gabriel insisted on being left for the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80430">

     "I'll send Hazen or Keyes back with the 'plane, for you," said he, as he

     climbed into the driving seat, after the passengers had been stowed.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80520">
     "Why this same machine?" inquired Craig.

     "Why? Because I intend to use this, and no other, in the final attack.

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80620">
     and opened the throttle.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80640">
     With a sudden gusty chatter, the engine caught. A great wind sprang up,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80650">
     from the roaring, whirling blades. The Floriot rolled easily forward,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80660">
     speeded up, and gathered headway.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80680">
     Gabriel suddenly rotated the rising-plane. The great gull soared,

     barometric-gauge, slowly spiralling upward, ever upward, as Gabriel

     climbed with his two passengers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80740">
     Then the lights sped forward, northward, in a long tangent, and, as they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80750">
     swiftly diminished to mere specks, the echo of a farewell hail drifted
    </p>

     downward from the black and star-dusted emptiness above.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_80780">
     Craig turned to Grantham, when the last gleam of light had faded in a

     almost bald, thus adding greatly to his strong suggestion of a vulture.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81120">
     His face was now more yellow and shrunken than ever, due to a rather

     heavier consumption of his favorite drug, morphine; his nose had hooked

     costly cigar he was smoking as he sat leaning far back in his

     desk-chair. And so those two, angry accuser and indifferent accused,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81420">
     faced each other for a moment; while, incessant, dull, mighty, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81430">
     thunders of the giant cataract mingled with the trembling diapason of

     the stupendous turbines in the rock-hewn caverns where old Niagara now

     bottomless coffers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81480">
     "See here!" Flint repeated angrily, once more shaking the dispatches at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81490">
     his mate. "Even our wireless system, all over the west and southwest,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81520">
     "That'll do, Flint!" the younger man retorted in a rough, hoarse voice.

     "If there's any trouble, I'll find it and repair it. Very well. But I'll

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81550">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81580">
     Malevolently he eyed the old man's beast-like face. The scorn and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81590">
     dislike he had conceived for Flint, years ago, when Flint had failed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81600">
     win back Catherine to him, had long grown keener and more bitter.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81610">
     Waldron took it as a personal affront that Flint, apparently so worn and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81620">
     feeble, could still hang on to life and brains enough to dominate the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81630">
     enterprise. A thousand times, if once, he had wished Flint well dead and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81640">
     buried and out of the way, so that he, Waldron, could grasp the whole
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81650">
     circle of the stupendous Air Trust. This, his supreme ambition, had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81660">
     constantly curbed by Flint's survival; and as the months and years had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81670">
     passed, his hate had grown more deep, more ugly, more venomous.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81690">
     "Why, curse it," Waldron often thought, "the old dope has taken enough
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81700">
     morphine in his lifetime to have killed a hundred ordinary men! And yet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81710">
     he still clings on, and withers, and grows yellow like an old dead leaf
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81720">
     that will not drop from the tree! When _will_ he drop? When _will_

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81730">
     Father Time pick the despicable antique? My God, is the man immortal?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81750">
     Such being the usual tenor of his thoughts, concerning Flint, small
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81760">
     wonder that he took the old man's chiding with an ill grace, and warned
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81770">
     him pointedly not to continue it. Now, facing the Billionaire, he fairly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81780">
     stared him out of countenance. An awkward silence followed. Both heard,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81790">
     with relief, a rapping at the office door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81810">
     "Come!" snapped Flint.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81830">
     A clerk appeared, with a yellow envelope in hand.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81850">
     "Another wireless, sir," said he.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81870">
     Flint snatched it from him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81890">
     "Send Herzog and Slade, at once," he commanded, as he ripped the
    </p>

     envelope.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81920">
     "Well, more trouble?" insolently drawled "Tiger" happy in the paling of

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81930">
     the old man's face and the sudden look of apprehension there.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_81950">
     For all answer, Flint handed him the message. Waldron read:

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82050">

     something back of it, all. But--but _what_? Rebellion is out of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82090">

     Flint stared at him with drug-contracted eyes.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82140">
     "Yes, that's the question," he rapped out. "What can it mean? Ah,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82150">
     perhaps Slade can tell us," he added, as the secret-service man quietly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82160">
     entered through a private door at the rear of the office.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82180">
     "Tell you what, gentlemen?" asked Slade, smirking and rubbing his hands.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82200">
     "The meaning of that, and that, and _that_!" snapped old Flint,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82210">
     thrusting the telegrams at the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82230">
     "Hm!" grunted the secret-service man, as he glanced them over. "That's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82240">
     damned odd! But it's of no real moment. If--if there's really any

     Slade.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82420">
     "See here, you!" he exclaimed. "This certainly means another uprising.

     don't deny the fact!" he cried, as the detective tried to oppose a word
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82450">
     of self-defense. "It's your fault, at last analysis; and if anything

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82700">
     brutal gleam flashed its message of hate and loathing. Foul as Slade

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82730">
     "I tell you," continued Flint, now having recovered his breath, "I tell

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82940">
     He snatched up a pencil from the desk, broke it in half and threw the

     pieces on the floor.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_82970">
     "Like that!" said he, and stamped on them.

     Waldron nodded approval.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_83190">

     "Suppose there were to be trouble, of any kind, how are we fixed for it?

     Herzog ventured nothing in reply to this outburst, save a conciliatory

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84560">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84730">
     "Correct," said Gabriel. "All six of us. That's our part of the program.

     their own telenite, to put them out of business forever and to free the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84810">
     "Poetic justice, all right enough!" laughed Marion. "At the same time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84820">
     that we're attacking from an elevation of perhaps three thousand feet,

     on, for that?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84860">
     "Well," judged Gabriel, "within a ten-mile radius of the plant, at least
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84870">
     a hundred thousand men are waiting, this very instant, with every nerve

     keyed up to fighting tension. Scattered in a vast variety of ingenious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84890">
     and cleverly-devised hiding places, with their chlorine grenades and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84900">
     their revolvers shooting little hydrocyanic acid gas bullets, they're

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84930">
     "Hydrocyanic acid gas!" exclaimed Marion, forgetting to smoke. "Why, one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84940">
     whiff of that is death!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84960">
     "It is," agreed Gabriel. "Remember, this is a war of extermination. It's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84970">
     a case of _them_ or _us_! And if we're worsted, the whole world loses;

     while if they are, then liberty is born! That's why this gas is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_84990">
     justifiable. They'll try to use oxygen-bullets on us, never fear. But
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85000">
     where they can kill ten, with those, we can annihilate a hundred with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85010">
     our kind. Swine, they have called us, and fools and apes. Well, we

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85020">
     shall see, we shall see, when it comes to an out-and-out fight between

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85030">
     Plutocrat and Proletarian, who is the better man!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85050">
     Again came silence. And this time it was Grantham who broke it.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85070">
     "Comrades," said he, "after you've seen as many Socialists shot down as

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85140">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85240">
     Nobody spoke, for a little while; but Marion and Craig smoked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85250">
     contemplatively, and the others sat there in the dusk, sunk in thought.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85270">
     All at once a door opened, and the vague form of a woman became visible.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85290">
     "Comrades, you must go," said she. "It's nearly half past five. By the

     time you've got everything in readiness, you'll have no time to lose."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85320">
     "Right, Catherine," answered Gabriel. "Come, comrades! Up and at it!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85340">
     Ten minutes later they all issued forth into the soft gloom. All were in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85350">
     aviator's dress, and each carried a parcel by a handle held with stout
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85360">
     straps. Had you seen them, you would have noticed they took particular
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85370">
     pains not to jar or shake these parcels, or approach unduly near each

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85380">
     other.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85400">
     At the door of the refuge, Catherine said good-bye to each, and added
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85410">
     some brave word of cheer. Her farewell to Gabriel was longer than to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85420">
     others; and for a moment their hands met and clung.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85440">
     "Go," she whispered, "go, and God bless you! Go even though it be to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85450">
     death! Their airmen will take toll of some of the attackers, Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85460">
     Not all the Comrades will return. Oh, may _you_--may _you_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85480">
     "What is written on the Book of Fate, will be," he answered. "Our petty
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85490">
     hopes and fears are nothing, Catherine. If death awaits me, it will be

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85500">
     sweet; for it will come, tonight, in the supreme service of the human

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85530">
     With a sudden motion, the girl took his face between her hands, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85540">
     kissed his forehead. For all her courage and strength, he sensed her
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85550">
     heart wildly beating and he felt her tears.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85570">
     "Good-bye, Gabriel," she breathed. "Would I might go with you! Would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85580">
     that my duty did not hold me here! Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85600">
     Then he was gone, gone with the others, into the thickening obscurity of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85610">
     the fog-shrouded evening. Now Catherine stood there alone, head bowed

     and wet face hidden in both hands.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85640">
     As the little fighting band disappeared, back to the girl drifted a few

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85870">
     "All right, come on," said a vague figure at the gate. The little group
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85880">
     approached. The gate opened. Silently they entered the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85900">
     Another man stepped from a hangar. In his hand he held an electric
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85910">
     flash, which he threw upon the newcomers, one by one.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85930">
     "Right!" he commented, and took Gabriel by the hand. "This way!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85950">
     Ten minutes later, all of them were in the air, save only Gabriel, who
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85960">
     insisted on staying till his entire squad had made a clean getaway. Then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85970">
     he too rose; and now in a long, swift line, the fighting squadron
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_85980">
     straightened away to north-eastward, on the twenty-mile run to Niagara.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86000">
     The night was foggy, chill and dark. All the aviators had instructions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86010">
     to fly not less than 2,500 feet high, to keep a careful lookout lest
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86020">
     they collide, and to steer by the lights of the great Air Trust plant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86030">
     For, misty though the heavens were, still Gabriel could see the dim glow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86040">
     of the tremendous aerial search-lights dominating Goat Island--lights
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86050">
     of 5,000,000 candle-power, maintained by current from the Falls,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86060">
     incessantly sweeping the sky on the lookout for just such perils as now,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86070">
     indeed, were drawing near.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86090">
     Momently, as he flew, Gabriel perceived these huge lights growing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86100">
     brighter, through the mist, and apprehension won upon him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86120">
     "Incredibly strong!" he muttered to himself, as he glanced from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86130">
     barometer to the shining fog ahead. "Even though the mist will be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86140">
     thicker over the Falls than anywhere else, there's a good possibility
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86150">
     they may pierce it and pick us up--and _then_, look out for their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86160">
     'planes and swift, fighting dirigibles!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86180">
     He rotated the rising-plane, and now soared to 2,800 feet. Below and on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86190">
     either side of him, nothing but tenuous fog. Ahead, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86200">
     swiftly-approaching fan of radiance, white, dazzling, beautiful, that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86210">
     seemed to gush from earth so far below and to the eastward. Already the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86220">
     thunders of the Falls were audible.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86240">
     "Where are the others?" Gabriel wondered, his thoughts seeming to hum
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86250">
     and roar in his head, in harmony with the shuddering diapason of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86260">
     muffler-deadened exhaust. "No way of telling, now. Each man for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86270">
     himself--and each to do his best!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86290">
     And then his thoughts reverted to Catherine; and round his heart a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86300">
     sudden yearning seemed to strengthen his stern, indomitable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86310">
     resolve--"Victory or death!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86330">
     But now there was scant time for thought. The moment of action was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86340">
     already close at hand. Far below there, hidden by night and dark and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86350">
     mist, Gabriel knew a hundred thousand comrades, of the Fighting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86360">
     Sections, were lying hidden, waiting for the signal to advance.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86380">
     "And it's time, now!" he said aloud, thrilled by a wondrous sense of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86390">
     vast responsibility--a sense that on this moment hung the fate of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86400">
     world. "It's time for the signal. Now then, up and at them!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86420">
     Taking the rocket--a powerful affair, capable of casting an intense,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86430">
     calcium light--he touched the fuse to a bit of smouldering punk fastened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86440">
     in a metal cup at his right hand. Then, as it flared, he launched the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86450">
     rocket far into the void.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86470">
     Below, came a quick spurt of radiance, in a long, vivid streak that shot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86480">
     away with incredible rapidity. Gabriel followed it a moment, with his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86490">
     gaze, then smiled.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86510">
     "The Rubicon is crossed," said he. "The gates of the Temple of Janus are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86520">
     open wide--and now comes War!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86540">
     He rose again, skimming to a still higher altitude as the glare of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86550">
     great Works drew closer and closer underneath. The wind roared in his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86560">
     ears, louder than the whirling propellers. The whole fabric of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86570">
     aeroplane quivered as it climbed, up, up above the rushing, bellowing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86580">
     cataract.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86600">
     "Where are the others?" thought he, and reached for a thanatos
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86610">
     projectile, in the rack near the metal cup where the punk still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86620">
     glowered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86640">
     All at once, a glare of light burst upward through the white-glowing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86650">
     mist; and the 'plane reeled with the air-wave, as now a thunderous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86660">
     concussion boomed across the empty spaces of the sky.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86680">
     At the same moment, a faint, ripping noise mounted to Gabriel--a sound
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86690">
     for all the world like the tearing of stout canvas. Then followed a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86700">
     chattering racket, something like distant mowing-machines at work; and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86710">
     now all blent to a steady, determined uproar. Gabriel almost thought to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86720">
     hear, as he launched his own projectile, far sounds as of the shouts and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86730">
     cries of men; but of this he could not make sure.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86750">
     "They're at it, anyhow!" he exulted. "At it, at last! By the way our men
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86760">
     have launched the attack, the first explosion must have breached a wall!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86770">
     God! What wouldn't I give to be down there, in the thick of it, rather
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86780">
     than here! I--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86800">
     _Crash_!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86820">
     Again a spouting geyser of light and uproar burst into mid-air.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86840">
     "That was _my_ thanatos speaking!" cried Gabriel. "Now for another!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86860">
     Before he could drop it, as he circled round and round, directly over
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86870">
     the great, flailing beams of the Air Trust search-lights, a third
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86880">
     detonation shattered the heavens, nearly unseating him. Up sprang the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86890">
     roar, with wonderful intensity, reflected from the earth as from a giant
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86900">
     sounding-board. And Gabriel noted, with keen satisfaction, that one of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86910">
     the huge light-beams had gone dark.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86930">
     "Put out _one_ of them, anyway, so far!" thought he, and swung again to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86940">
     westward, and once more dropped a messenger of death to tyranny.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86960">
     Now the bombardment became general. Trust aerial-gun projectiles began
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86970">
     bursting all about. Every second or two, terrible concussions leaped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86980">
     toward the zenith; and the earth, hidden somewhere down there below the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_86990">
     fog-blanket, seemed flaming upward like a huge volcano. One by one the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87000">
     search-lights, whipping the sky, went black; and now the glow of them
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87010">
     was fast diminishing, only to be replaced by a ruddier and more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87020">
     intermittent glare.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87040">
     "The plant's burning, at last," thought Gabriel. "Heaven grant the fire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87050">
     may spread to the oxygen-tanks! If we can only get _those_--!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87070">
     Again he launched a projectile, and again he circled over the doomed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87080">
     plant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87100">
     A swift black shape swooped by him. He had just time to exchange a yell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87110">
     of warning, when it was gone. The near peril gripped his heart, but did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87120">
     not shake it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87140">
     "Close call!" said he.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87160">
     If that machine and his had met, good-bye forever! But after all, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87170">
     danger of collision in mid-air, or of being struck by a projectile from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87180">
     some other machine, above, was no greater than his comrades on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87190">
     ground were facing. Not so great, perhaps. Many a one would meet his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87200">
     death from the aerial attack. In a war like this, a thousand perils
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87210">
     threatened. Gabriel only hoped that Hargreaves, down below there, could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87220">
     hold them back, away, till the walls should have been destroyed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87240">
     Circling, ever circling, now hearing some echoes of the earth-battle,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87250">
     some grenade-volleys and rapid-fire clattering, now deafened and all but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87260">
     blinded by the vast, up-belching explosions of the thanatos projectiles,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87270">
     Gabriel flew among the drifting mists and vapors. Still was he guided by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87280">
     one or two search-lights; but most of these were gone, now. Yet the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87290">
     glare of the conflagration, below, was luridly shuddering through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87300">
     fog, painting it all a dull and awful red.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87320">
     Red! Suddenly words came into Gabriel's mind--the words of his own poem:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87340">
     ... Red as blood, red as blood! The blood of the shattered miner,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87350">
     Blood of the boy in the rifle pits, blood of the coughing child-slave,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87360">
     Blood of the mangled trainman, blood that the Carpenter shed!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87380">
     "For your sake! For the world's sake, this!" he cried, and hurled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87390">
     another thanatos. "If ever war of liberation was holy, this is that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87400">
     war!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87420">
     Suddenly, through all the turmoil of shattering explosions, tossing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87430">
     air-currents and drifting, acrid smoke, he became conscious of a sudden,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87440">
     swift-flying pursuer.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87460">
     By the light of the burning Plant, down there somewhere in the vapors of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87470">
     the thunderous Falls, he saw a hawk-like 'plane that swooped toward him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87480">
     with incredible velocity, savage and lean and black.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87500">
     Off to the right, a sudden spattering of shots in mid-air told him the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87510">
     battle in the sky was likewise being engaged. He saw vague, veiled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87520">
     explosions, there, then a swift, falling trail of flame. A pang shot
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87530">
     through his heart. Had one of his companions fallen and been dashed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87540">
     death? He could not tell--he had no time to wonder, even, for already
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87550">
     the attacker was upon him, the swift Air Trust _Ã©pervier,_ one of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87560">
     dreaded air-fleet of the world-monopoly!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87580">
     Gabriel had just time to swerve from the attack, and swoop
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87590">
     aloft--dropping his next to last projectile as he did so--when the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87600">
     whirling shape zoomed past, swung round and once more charged. He saw,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87610">
     vaguely, two men sat in it. One was the pilot, a "Gray" or Cosmos
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87620">
     mercenary. The other--could it be? Yes, there was no mistaking! The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87630">
     other was Slade himself, commander of the hireling army of Plutocracy!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87650">
     Out from the attacking 'plane jetted sadden spurts of fire. Gabriel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87660">
     heard the zip-zip-zip of bullets; heard a ripping tear, as one of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87670">
     canvas wings was punctured--God help him, had that explosive bullet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87680">
     struck a wire or a stay!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_87700">
     Then, maddened to despair; and burning with fierce rage against this

     The plant regiment was mustered and the Cosmos mercenaries and scabs

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88460">
     "What's what?" retorted Waldron, testily. He had been drinking rather
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88470">
     more heavily than usual, that day, both because of the dull weather and
    </p>

     because the Falls invariably got on his nerves, during his brief

     sojourns there. Away from New York and his favorite haunts, Waldron was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88500">
     lost. "What's what?" he repeated with an ugly look. "This roaring,

     "That! That light in the sky!" cried Flint, excitedly pointing. "See?

     No--it's gone now! But it looked like--like a rocket! A signal, of some

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88570">
     Waldron laughed harshly.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88590">
     "Seeing things, eh?" he sneered, coming across to the window, himself,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88600">
     and peering out. "_I_ don't see anything! Nothing here to worry about,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88640">
     beginning to wake up, as the graveyard becomes more a probability

     than--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88670">
     "Enough!" Flint snapped at him. "When you drink, Waldron, you're an

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88680">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88690">
     just now saw a signal-light up there in the mist. There's trouble coming

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88720">
     We'd be much better off out of here. If there--there should be any

     fighting, you know--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88750">
     His voice broke in a falsetto pipe. Waldron laughed brutally.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88770">
     "Bravo!" cried he, with flushed and mottled face. "You'll do, Flint! I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88780">
     see, right now, the firing-line is the life for you! Well, let the row

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88810">
     The sentence was never finished, For suddenly a shattering explosion
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88820">
     hurled a vast section of the western encircling wall outward, out into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88830">
     the River, and, where but a moment before, the partners had been gazing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88840">
     at a high concrete-and-steel barrier, with electric lights on top, now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88850">
     only a huge gap appeared, through which the foam-tossed current could be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88860">
     seen leaping swiftly onward toward the Falls.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88880">
     Hurled back from the window by the force of the explosion, both men were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88890">
     struck dumb with terror and amaze. Flint rallied first, and with a cry
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88900">
     of rage, inarticulate as a beast's howl, sprang to the window again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88920">
     Outside, a scene of desolation and wild activity was visible. The great,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88930">
     paved courtyard, flanked by the turbine houses and the wall, on one
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88940">
     hand, and on the other by the oxygen tanks' huge bulk that loomed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88950">
     vaguely through the electric-lighted mist, now had begun to swarm with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88960">
     men.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88980">
     Flint saw a few forms lying prone under the hard glare of the arcs and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_88990">
     vacuum lights. Others were crawling, writhing, making strange
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89000">
     contortions. Here, there, men with rifles were running to take their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89010">
     posts. Hoarse orders were shouted, and shrill replies rang back.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89030">
     Then, all at once, a kind of sputtering series of small explosions began
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89040">
     to rip along the edge of the south wall. And now, machine-guns began to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89050">
     talk, with a dry, hard metallic clatter. And--though whence these came,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89060">
     Flint could not see--grenades began flying over the wall and bursting in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89070">
     the court. Though unwounded, men fell everywhere these gas-projectiles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89080">
     exploded--fell, stone dead and stiffening at once--fell, in strange,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89090">
     monstrous, awful attitudes of death.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89110">
     Steam began billowing up; and crackling electrical discharges leaped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89120">
     along the naked wires of the outer barricades.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89140">
     The whole Plant shook and rattled with the violent concussions of the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89170">
     Somewhere, out of the range of vision, another terrible shock made the

     building tremble to its nethermost foundation; and wild yells and cries,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89190">
     as of a charge, a repulse, a savage and determined rush, echoed through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89200">
     the vast enclosure. Came a third detonation--and, blinding in its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89210">
     intensity, a globe of fire burst almost beneath the window, five stories
    </p>

     below.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89240">
     The partners, shaking and pale, retreated hastily. A swift,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89250">
     upward-rising shape swept over the courtyard and was gone--one of the

     air-fleet now launched to meet the attackers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89280">
     Far below a sudden crumbling shudder of masonry told the Billionaire

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89290">
     not a moment was to be lost, for already one wing of the Administration

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89320">
     "Quick, Waldron! Quick!" he shouted, in the shrill treble of senility,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89330">
     and ran into the corridor that led to the north wing. Waldron, suddenly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89340">
     sobered, followed; and from the offices, where the night-shift of clerks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89350">
     were laboring (or had been, till the first explosion), came crowding
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89360">
     pale and frightened men. Not the fighting cast of Air Trust slaves,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89380">
     scabs, to a man. Now, in the common sentiment of fear, they jostled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89390">
     Flint and Waldron, as though these plutocrats had been but common clay.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89400">
     And in the corridor a babel rose, through which fresh volleys and ever
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89410">
     more and more violent explosions ripped and thundered.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89430">
     Flint struck savagely at some who barred his way; and Waldron elbowed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89440">
     through, with curses.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89460">
     "Get out of the way, you swine!" shrilled the old Billionaire. "Make

     way, there! Way!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89490">
     The two men reached a door that led by a private passage, through to the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89590">
     tried to press, on toward the armored laboratories; but with vile
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89600">
     blasphemies the plutocrats beat them back and slammed the door.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89620">
     "To Hell with _them_!" shouted Flint, perfectly ashen now and shaking
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89630">
     like a leaf, the fear of death strong on his withered soul. "We've got
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89640">
     all we can do to look after ourselves! Quick, Waldron, quick!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89660">
     Both men, sick with panic, with fear of the unknown terror from above,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89670">
     stumbled rather than ran along the passage, and presently reached the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89680">
     laboratory.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89700">
     Here Waldron unlocked another door, this time a steel one, and--as they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89710">
     both crowded through--pressed a hand to his dizzy head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89730">
     "Safe!" he gulped, slamming the door again. "They can't get us _here_,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89740">
     at any rate, no matter what happens! This place is like a fort, and--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89760">
     His speech was interrupted by a dazing, deafening tumult of sound. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89770">
     earth trembled, and the laboratory, steel though it was, with concrete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89780">
     facing, rocked on its foundation. A glare through the windows, quickly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89790">
     fading, told them the building they had just quitted was now but a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89800">
     smoking pile of ruin.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89820">
     Flint gasped, unable to speak. Waldron, shaking and cowed, tried to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89830">
     moisten his dry lips with a thick tongue.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89850">
     "We--we weren't any too soon!" he gulped, without one thought of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89860">
     doomed scabs in the Administration Building. Stern justice was now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89870">
     overtaking these wretches. False to the working-class, and eager to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89880">
     serve the Air Trust--not only eager to serve, but zealous in any attack
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89890">
     on the proletariat, and by their very employment serving to rivet the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89900">
     shackles on the world--now they were abandoned by their masters.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89920">
     Between upper and nether millstone, moving with neither, they were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89930">
     caught and crushed. And as the great building quivered, gaped wide
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89940">
     open, swayed and came thundering down in a vast pile of flame-lit ruin,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89950">
     whence a volcanic burst of fire, smoke and dust arose, they perished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89960">
     miserably, time-servers, cowards and self-seekers to the last.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89980">
     But Flint and Waldron still survived. Though the very earth shook and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_89990">
     trembled with the roar of bombs, the crumbling of massive walls, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90000">
     rattle of volley-fire and the crashing of the terrible grenades that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90010">
     mowed down hundreds as they spread their poisonous gas abroad--though
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90020">
     the shriek of projectiles, the thunder of the air-ship guns now sweeping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90030">
     the sky in blind endeavor to shatter the attackers all swelled the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90040">
     tumult to a frightful storm of terror and of death; they still lived,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90050">
     cowered and cringed there in the bomb-proof steel-and-concrete of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90060">
     inner laboratories.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90080">
     "Come, come!" Flint quavered, peering about him at the deserted room,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90090">
     still glaring with electric light--the room now abandoned by all its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90100">
     workers, who, members of Herzog's regiment, had run to take their posts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90110">
     at the first signal of attack. "Come--this isn't safe enough, even here.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90120">
     In--in there!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90140">
     He pointed toward a vault-like door, leading to the subterranean steel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90150">
     chambers where Herzog eventually counted on storing some hundreds of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90160">
     thousands of tons of liquid oxygen--the reserve-chambers, impregnable to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90170">
     lightning, fire, frost or storm, to man's attacks or nature's--the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90180">
     chambers blasted from the living rock, deep as the Falls themselves,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90190">
     vacuum-lined, wondrous achievement of the highest engineering skill the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90200">
     world could boast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90220">
     "There! There!" repeated Flint, plucking at the dazed Waldron's sleeve.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90230">
     "Tool-steel and concrete, twenty-five feet thick--and vacuum chambers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90240">
     all about--_there_ we can hide! There's safety! Come, come quick!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90260">
     Staring, white-faced (he who had been so red!) and dumb, Waldron
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90270">
     yielded. Together, furtive as the criminals they were, these two
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90280">
     world-masters slunk toward the steel door, while without, their empire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90290">
     was crashing down in smoke, and flame, and blood!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90310">
     They had almost reached it when a smash of glass at the far end of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90320">
     laboratory whipped them round, in keener terror.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90340">
     Staring, wild-eyed, they beheld the crouching figure of Herzog. Running,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90350">
     even as he cringed, he had upset a glass retort, which had shattered on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90360">
     the concrete floor. And as he ran, he screamed:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90380">
     "_They're in! They're coming! Quick--the steel vaults! Let me in, there!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90390">
     Let me in!_"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90410">
     The coward was now a maniac with terror, his face perfectly white,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90420">
     writhen with panic, and with staring eyes that gleamed horribly under
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90430">
     the greenish vacuum-lights.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90450">
     "Back, you! Get out!" roared Waldron, raising a fist. "We--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90470">
     A sudden belch of flame, outside, split the night with terrible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90480">
     virescence. The whole steel building trembled and swayed. Some of its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90490">
     girders buckled; and the east wall, nearest the oxygen-tanks, caved
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90500">
     inward as a mass of many tons was hurled against it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90520">
     A stunning concussion flung all three men to the floor; and, as they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90530">
     fell, a withering heat-wave quivered through the place.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90550">
     "The oxygen-tanks!" gasped Flint. "They're blown up--they're
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90560">
     burning--God help us!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90580">
     Scorching, yet still eager to live, he crawled on hands and knees toward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90590">
     the steel door. Waldron dragged himself along, half-dead with terror.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90600">
     Now, dripping gouts of inextinguishable fire were raining on the roof of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90610">
     the building. A whirlwind of flame was sweeping all its eastern side;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90620">
     and a glare like that of Hell itself seared the eyes of the fugitives.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90640">
     Quivering, trembling, slavering, the old man and Waldron wrenched the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90650">
     steel door open.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90670">
     "_Me! Me! Let me in! Me! Save me!_" howled Herzog, dragging himself
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90680">
     toward them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90700">
     They only laughed derisively, with howls of demoniacal scorn.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90720">
     "You slave! You cur!" shouted Waldron, and spat at him as he drew the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90730">
     vault door shut. "You cringing dog--stay there, now, and face it!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90750">
     The great door boomed shut. In the cool of the winding stairway of steel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90760">
     which led, lighted by electricity, to the trap-door and the ladder down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90770">
     into the tremendous vaults, the world-masters breathed deeply once more,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90780">
     respited from death.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90800">
     Herzog, screaming like a fiend in torment, clawed at the impenetrable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90810">
     steel door, raved, begged, entreated, and tore his fingers on the lock.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90830">
     No answer, save the muffled echo of a jeer, from within.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90850">
     _Boom!_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90870">
     What was that?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90890">
     Mad with terror though he was, he whirled about, and faced the room now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90900">
     quivering with heat.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90920">
     Even as he looked, a great gap yawned in the western wall, farthest from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90930">
     the flame-belching oxygen-tank that had been struck.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90950">
     Through this gap, pouring irresistibly as the sea, swept a tide of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90960">
     attackers, storming the inner citadel of the infernal, world-strangling
    </p>

     Air Trust.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_90990">
     At the head of this victorious army, this flood triumphant of the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91000">
     embattled proletaire, Herzog's staring eyes caught a moment's glimpse of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91010">
     a dreaded face--the face of Gabriel Armstrong.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91030">
     Gasping, the coward and tool of the world-masters made one supreme
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91040">
     decision. Close by, a rack of vials stood. He whirled to it, snatched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91050">
     out a tiny bottle and waiting not even to draw the cork--craunched the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91060">
     bottle, glass and all, in his fang-like, uneven teeth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91080">
     An instant change swept over him. His staring eyes closed, his head fell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91090">
     forward, his whole body collapsed like an empty sack. He fell, twitched
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91100">
     once or twice, and was dead--dead ere the attackers could reach the door
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91110">
     of steel where his bestial masters had betrayed him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91130">
     Thus perished Herzog, coward and tool, a victim of the very forces he

     confusion of terrible wind, and lurid light, and the wild roar of myriad

     missiles. Whither should he steer? He knew not. All sense of direction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91570">
     was lost, nor could the compass tell him anything. A glance at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91580">
     barometric gauge showed him an altitude of but 850 feet, and this was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91590">
     decreasing with terrible rapidity.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91610">
     Strive as he might, he could not check the swift descent.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91630">
     "God send me a soft place to fall on!" he thought, grimly, still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91640">
     clinging to his machine and laboring to jockey it under control.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91660">
     Close by, a thunderous detonation crashed through the mist. His machine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91670">
     reeled and swerved, then plunged more swiftly still. All became vague,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91680">
     to Gabriel--a dream--a nightmare!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91700">
     _Crash!_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91720">
     Flung from the seat, he sprawled through treetops, caught himself, fell
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91730">
     to a lower limb, slid off and landed among thick bushes; and through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91740">
     these came to earth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91760">
     The wrecked 'plane, whirling away and down, fell crashing into the river
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91770">
     that rushed cascading by, and vanished in the firelit mist.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91790">
     Stunned, yet half-conscious, Gabriel presently sat up and pressed his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91800">
     right hand to his head. His left arm felt numb and useless; and when he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91810">
     tried to raise it, he found it refused his will.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91830">
     "Where am I, now, I'd like to know?" he muttered. "Not dead, anyhow--not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91840">
     _yet_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91860">
     A continuous roar of explosions shuddered the air, mingled with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91870">
     booming of the mighty Falls. Shouts and cheers and the rattle of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91880">
     machine-guns assailed his ear. The glare of the search-lights, through
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91890">
     the mist and steam, was darkened momentarily by thick, greasy coils of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91900">
     smoke, shot through by violent flashes of light as explosions took
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91910">
     place.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91930">
     Gabriel struggled to his feet, and peered about him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91950">
     "Still alive!" said he. "And I must get back into the fight! That's all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91960">
     that matters, now--the fight!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91980">
     He knew not, yet, where he was; but this mattered nothing. His machine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_91990">
     had, in fact, fallen near the river bank, in the eastern section of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92000">
     Prospect Park, beyond the Goat Island bridge--this region of the Park
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92010">
     having been left outside the fortifications, in the extension of the Air
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92020">
     Trust plant.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92040">
     The trees, here, had saved his life. Had he smashed to earth a hundred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92050">
     yards further north, he would have been shattered against high walls and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92060">
     roofs.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92080">
     Still giddy, but sensing no pain from his injured left arm, Gabriel made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92090">
     way toward the scene of conflict. He knew nothing of how the tide of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92100">
     battle was going; nothing of his position; nothing as to what men he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92110">
     would first meet, his comrades or the enemy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92130">
     But for these considerations he had no thought. His only idea, fixed and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92140">
     grim, was "The fight!" Dazed though he still was, he nerved himself for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92150">
     action.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92170">
     And so, pressing onward through the livid glare, through the night
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92180">
     shattered by stupendous detonations, he drew his revolver and broke into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92190">
     a run.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92210">
     Strange evidences of the battle now became evident. He saw an unexploded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92220">
     grenade lying beside a wounded man who grasped at him and moaned with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92230">
     pain. Over a wrecked motor-car, greasy smoke was rising, as it burned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92240">
     Louder shouting drew him down a path to the left. Masses of moving
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92250">
     figures became dimly visible, through the mist. And now, stabs of fire
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92260">
     pierced the confusion and clamorous night.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92280">
     Gabriel jerked up his revolver, as he ran, the terrible weapon shooting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92290">
     bullets charged with hydrocyanic-acid gas.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92310">
     A man rose before him, shouting.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92330">
     Gabriel levelled the weapon; but a glimpse of red ribbon in the other's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92340">
     coat brought it down again.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92360">
     "Comrade!" cried he. "Where's the attack?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92380">
     The other pointed.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92400">
     "Gabriel! Is that you?" he gasped, staring.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92420">
     "Yes! I fell--machine smashed--come on!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92440">
     "Hurt?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92460">
     "No! Arm, maybe. No matter! God! What's this?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92480">
     Toward them a sudden swirl of men came sweeping, stumbling, shouting, in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92490">
     pandemonium.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92510">
     "Our men!" cried Gabriel, starting forward again. "We're being driven!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92520">
     Rally, here! Rally!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92540">
     Beyond, a louder crackling sounded. Here, there, men plunged down. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92550">
     retreat was becoming a rout!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92570">
     Yelling, Gabriel flung himself upon the men.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92590">
     "Back there!" he vociferated. "Back, and at the walls! Come on, boys,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92600">
     now! Come on!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92620">
     His voice, well known to nearly all, thrilled them again with new
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92630">
     determination. A shout rose up; it swelled, deepened, roared to majestic
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92640">
     volume.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92660">
     Then the tide turned.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92680">
     Back went the fighting men of the great Revolution. back at the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92690">
     machine-guns, mounted in the breached walls.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92710">
     Gabriel was caught and whirled along in that living tide. He found
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92720">
     himself at its crest, its foremost wave. Behind him, a roaring, rushing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92730">
     river of men. Before the Inner Citadel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92750">
     Gathering speed and weight as it rolled up, the wave broke like an ocean
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92760">
     surge over a crumbling dyke.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92780">
     Down went the Air Trust gunners and the guns, down, down to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92790">
     annihilation!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92810">
     Through the breach, foaming and swelling with irresistible power burst
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92820">
     the tides of victory.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92840">
     Silenced now were the Trust guns. The steam-jets had none to man them.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92850">
     Far aloft, a last explosion told the death story of the final

     _Ã©pervier_.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92880">
     Here and there, from windows and corners of the wrecked and blazing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92890">
     plant, a little intermittent firing still continued; but now the hearts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92900">
     of these Air Trust defenders--scabs, thugs and scourings of the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92940">
     They fled, those mercenaries, and all the ways and inner

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_92950">
     strongholds--such as still were left--now lay open to Gabriel and his

     and concrete laboratories, heart and soul and center of the hellish

     world-conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93030">
     Stormed it, as it began to blaze and crumble; stormed it, in search of

     Flint and Waldron, would-be murderers of the world.
    </p>

     Stormed it, only to see Herzog gnash his teeth upon the flask, and
    </p>

     fall, and die; only to know that there, within the rock-hewn,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93080">
     steel-lined tanks, below, their enemies had still outwitted them!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93100">
     The swift onrush of the fire drove the victors back.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93120">
     "_Out, comrades! Out of here_!" shouted Gabriel, facing the attackers.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93140">
     None too soon. Hardly had they beaten a retreat, back into the vast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93150">
     courtyard again, strewn with the dead, when a second oxygen tank
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93160">
     exploded, overwhelming the laboratory building with tons of flying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93170">
     steel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93190">
     Leaping toward the zenith, a giant tongue of flame roared heavenward. So
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93200">
     intense the heat had now become, that the solid brick and concrete
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93210">
     walls, exposed to the direct verberation of the flame, began to crack
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93220">
     and crumble.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93240">
     Gabriel ordered a general retreat of the attacking army. Victory was

     won; and to stay near that gushing tornado of flame, with new explosions

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93710">
     With this comforting belief, together they descended the long steel

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93750">
     Here, everything was cool and quiet and well-lighted. Not yet had the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93840">
     Reassured a little, they descended to the very bottom of the first huge

     tank.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_93870">
     "God!" snarled Flint, as he breathed deeply and glared about him. "The

     Flint, for the first time hearing Waldron's honest opinion of him,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94030">
     failed even to note it. All his panic-stricken ear had caught was the

     note of hope, of survival.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94060">
     Clutching eagerly at Waldron's sleeve, he cackled:

     "If we get through? If we get through, you say? Then, in your opinion,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94120">
     "Bah!" Waldron flung at him, some latent spark of courage still

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94130">
     smouldering in his sodden breast, whereas old Flint was craven to the

     marrow. "You nauseate me! Afraid to die, eh? Well, so am I; but not so

     sheer panic over, a little manhood was returning. But as for Flint, no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94270">
     manhood dwelt in him to be awakened. Instead, each moment found him more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94280">
     abject and more pitiable. Like an old woman he now wrung his hands and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94290">
     groaned, hysterically; and now he paced the steel floor of the vault
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94300">
     that was destined to be his tomb; and now he stopped again and stared
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94310">
     about him with wild eyes.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94330">
     On all sides, sheer up a hundred feet or more, the smooth steel sides of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94340">
     the vast oxygen tank rose, studded with long lines of rivets.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94360">
     Near the top a dark aperture showed where the six-inch pipe joined the

     tank; the pipe destined to fill it, when Herzog's last process--never,

     now, to be completed--should have been done.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94400">
     The huge floor, 150 feet in diameter, sloped gently downward toward the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94410">
     center; and here yawned another pipe, covered by a grating--the pipe to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94420">
     drain the liquid oxygen out to the pumping station.

     So deeply set in the rock of the Niagara cliff was this stupendous

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94460">
     faintest sound of the Falls was audible. All that betrayed the nearness
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94470">
     of the cataract was a faint, incessant trembling of the metal walls, as
    </p>

     though the solid ribs of Earth herself were shuddering with the impact
    </p>

     of the plunge.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94510">
     Old Flint surveyed this extraordinary chamber with mingled feelings. It
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94520">
     surely offered absolute protection, for the present--or seemed to--but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94530">
     his distressed mind conjured alarming pictures of the future, in case no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94540">
     rescue came. Death by starvation, thirst and madness loomed before him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94550">
     Nervously he recommenced his pacing. Another terribly serious factor was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94560">
     to be considered. He had now been three hours without his dose of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94570">
     morphia, and his nerves were calling, tugging insistently for it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94590">
     "Rotten luck," he grumbled, "that I've got none with me!" Even there, in

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94600">
     the imminent presence of disaster and death, his mind reverted to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94610">
     poison, more necessary to him than food.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94630">
     Waldron now had grown fairly calm. He stood leaning against the steel
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94640">
     ladder, down which they had descended. Choosing a cigar, he proceeded to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94650">
     light up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94670">
     "Might as well be comfortable while we wait," said he. "I only wish we

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94680">
     had a couple of chairs, down here. Oversight on our part that we didn't

     have some steel ones put in, and a line of canned goods and a few quarts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94700">
     of Scotch. The floor's a bit damp and cold to sit on, and I want a drink
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94710">
     damn bad!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94730">
     Flint swung about and faced him, pale and shaking, tortured with fear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94740">
     and with longing for his dope.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94760">
     "You--you don't think it _will_ be long, eh, do you?" he demanded. "Not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94770">
     long before we're taken out?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94790">
     Waldron shrugged his shoulders and blew a long, thin arrow of smoke
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94800">
     athwart the brightly-lighted air.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94820">
     "Search me!" he exclaimed. "To judge by what was happening when we made

     surprise. Caught us napping, damn them, after all! They were stronger
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94860">
     than we thought, Flint, and cleverer, and better organized. And so--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94880">
     "Don't say 'we,' curse you!" snarled Flint. "Blame yourself, if you want

     _me_ in your blame!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94970">
     Waldron shrugged his shoulders, and smoked contemplatively.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_94990">
     "Suit yourself," he answered. "If we both die, down here, it won't
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95000">
     matter much either way."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95020">
     "Die?" quavered the old jackal, suddenly forgetting his rage and peering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95030">
     about with furtive eyes. "Did you say die, Wally? No, no! You didn't say

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95040">
     that! You didn't mean that, surely!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95060">
     Waldron smiled, evilly, joying in this abject fear of his hated partner.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95080">
     "Oh, yes, I did, though," he retorted. "It's quite possible, you know.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95090">
     In case our government--yours, if you prefer--can't get troops through,

     "No, no, no! Not that, not _that_!" whimpered Flint, shuddering. "I

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95200">
     "Cut it!" gibed Waldron, spitting with very disgust. "If your time's

     and bone. You'll starve far quicker than I will, old man."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95290">
     "Don't! Don't!" implored the shaking wretch, covering his eyes with both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95300">
     trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95320">
     "Moral, you oughtn't to have been a dope-fiend, all these years,"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95330">
     continued Waldron, cuttingly, determined that now, once for all, his

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95350">
     is, I don't understand. When I tried to marry Kate, and failed, I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95360">
     reckoned you'd pass over in almost no time--and, by the way, that's why

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95370">
     I was so insistent. But you've disappointed me, Flint. Disappointed me

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95380">
     sorely. You still live. It won't be long, however. Down here, you know,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95390">
     you simply can't get any dope. In a little while you'll begin to suffer

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95400">
     the torments of Hell. You'll die of starvation and drug 'yen,' Flint,

     pulse beat faster than usual, and a certain extravagance of thought and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95470">
     speech had become manifest in him.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95490">
     He tried to compose himself, feeling that he must not push the cowardly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95500">
     Flint too far, but his ideas refused to flow in orderly sequence.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95510">
     Wonderingly he stared at his cigar, the tip of which was now glowing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95520">
     more brightly than before.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95540">
     And then, suddenly sniffing the air he understood. His eyes widened with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95550">
     horror absolute. He started forward, gasped and cried:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95570">
     "_Flint! Flint! The oxygen is coming in!_"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95590">
     Uncomprehending, the old man still stood there, mumbling to himself. His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95600">
     face was now tinged with unusual color, and his heart, too, was thumping
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95610">
     strangely.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95630">
     "_Oxygen_!" shouted Waldron, shaking him by the shoulder. "It--it's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95640">
     leaking in, here, somewhere! If we can't stop it--_we're dead men_!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95660">
     "Eh? _What_?" stammered the Billionaire, staring at him with eyes of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95670">
     half-intoxicated fear. "What d'you mean, the oxygen? In--in here?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95690">
     "_In here_!" cried "Tiger," casting a wild and terrible gaze about him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95700">
     at the vast, empty trap of steel. "Can't you smell it? That ozone
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95710">
     smell? My God, we're lost! We're lost!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95730">
     "You're crazy!" retorted Flint, with vigor. "Nothing of the sort could
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95740">
     happen!" His head was held high, now, and new life seemed surging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95750">
     through that spent and drug-wrecked body. "There's no way those curs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95760">
     could have turned on any gas, here. You're crazy, ha! ha! ha! Insane,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95770">
     eh? A good joke--capital joke, that! I must tell it at the Union League
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95780">
     Club! 'Tiger' Waldron, suddenly insane, and--ha! ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95800">
     He burst into a long, shrill cacchination. Already his face was scarlet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95810">
     and his mind a whirl. Though neither man understood the reason, yet the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95820">
     fact remained that one of the last great explosions had ruptured a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95830">
     subterranean check-valve closing the six-inch pipe that was to feed the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95840">
     storage-tanks; and now a swift, huge stream of pure oxygen gas was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95850">
     rushing at tremendous velocity into the vast chamber of steel.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95870">
     Waldron, his heart leaping as though it would burst his ribs, raised a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95880">
     fist to strike down his insulter; then, with drunken indecision, joined
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95890">
     in the maniacal laughter of the staggering old man.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95910">
     In their ears a strange, wild humming now became audible. Lights danced
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95920">
     before their eyes; their senses reeled, and violent, extravagant ideas
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95930">
     surged through their drunken brains.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95950">
     "_Ha! Ha! Ha!_" rang Waldron's crazy laughter, echoing the old man's.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95960">
     All at once, his cigar broke into flame. Cursing, he hurled it away,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95970">
     staggering back against the ladder and stood there swaying, clutching it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_95980">
     to hold himself from falling.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96000">
     There he stood, and stared at Flint, with eyes that started from his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96010">
     head, with panting breath and crimson face.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96030">
     The old man, in a sudden revulsion of terror, was now grovelling along
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96040">
     the floor, by one of the massive walls, clawing at the steel with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96050">
     impotent hands and screaming mingled prayers and oaths. His ravings,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96060">
     horrible to hear, echoed through the great tank, now swiftly filling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96070">
     with gas.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96090">
     "Help! Help!" he screamed. "Save me--my God--save me--. Let me out, let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96100">
     me out! A million, if you let me out! A billion--_the whole world_! The

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96110">
     world, ha! ha! ha! Damn it to Hell--the world, I say! I'll give the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96120">
     world to be let out! It's mine--I own it--_all, all mine!_ Ha! Dogs! You
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96130">
     would rise up against your master and your God, would you? But it's no
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96140">
     use--we'll beat you yet--out! _out_!--the world--I own it! All this

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96150">
     plant--this gas, all mine! My oxygen--ah! it chokes me! _Help!

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96160">
     Help!_--Swine! I'll scourge you yet--_absolute power_--_the world_--!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96180">
     With one final spark of energy, panting, his heart flailing itself to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96190">
     death under the pitiless urge of the oxygen, old Flint sprang up, ran
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96200">
     wildly, blindly straight across the steel floor, and, screaming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96210">
     blasphemies like a soul in Hell, dashed into the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96230">
     He recoiled, staggered, spun round and fell sprawling most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96240">
     horribly--stone dead.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96260">
     Waldron, at sight of this awful end, felt an uncontrollable terror sweep
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96270">
     over his drunk and maddened senses. Though all his blood was leaping in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96280">
     his arteries, and his breath coming so fast it choked him, yet a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96290">
     moment's seeming sanity possessed his reeling brain.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96310">
     "The door! The door, up there!" he screamed, with a wild, terrible
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96320">
     curse.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96340">
     Then, turning toward the ladder, in spite of his fat and flabby muscles
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96350">
     quivering in terrible spasms, he ran up the long steel structure with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96360">
     supreme and ape-like agility.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96380">
     Fifty feet he made, seventy-five, ninety--
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96400">
     But, all at once, something seemed to break in his overtaxed heart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96420">
     A blackness swam before his dazzled eyes. His head fell back. Unnerved,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96430">
     his fingers lost their hold. And, whirling over and over in midair, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96440">
     dropped like a plummet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96460">
     By one wall lay Flint's body. At the foot of the ladder, like a crushed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96470">
     sack of bones, sprawled the corpse of "Tiger" Waldron.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96490">
     And still the rushing oxygen, with which they two had hoped to dominate
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96500">
     the world, poured through the six-inch main, far, far above--senseless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96510">
     matter, blindly avenging itself upon the rash and evil men who impiously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96520">
     had sought to cage and master it!

     VISIONS.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96610">
     Thus perished Flint and Waldron, scourges of the earth. Thus they died,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96620">
     slain by the very force which they had planned would betray mankind and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96630">
     deliver it into their chains. Thus vanished, forever, the most sinister
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96640">
     and cruel minds ever evolved upon this planet; the greatest menace the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96650">
     human race had ever known; the evil Masters of the World.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96670">
     And as they died, massed around their perished Air Trust plant, a throng
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96680">
     of silent, earnest watchers stood, with faces illumined by the symbolic,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96690">
     sacrificial flames--a throng of emancipated workers, of toilers from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96700">
     whose bowed shoulders now forever had been lifted the frightful menace
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96710">
     of a universal bondage.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96730">
     Explosion after explosion burst from the tortured Inferno of the vast
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96740">
     plant. Buildings came crashing, reeling, thundering down; walls fell,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96750">
     amid vast, belching clouds of dust and smoke; a white, consuming sheet
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96760">
     of flame crackled across the sinister and evil place; and in its wake
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96770">
     glowed incandescent ruins.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96790">
     Then, in one final burst of thunderous tumult, the hugest tank of all,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96800">
     exploding with a roar like that of Doom itself, hurled belching flames
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96810">
     on high.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96830">
     For many miles--in Buffalo, Rochester, Toronto and scores of cities on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96840">
     both sides of the Great Lakes--silent multitudes watched the glare
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96850">
     against the midnight sky; and many wept for joy; and many prayed. All
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96860">
     understood the meaning of that sight. The light upon the heavens seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96870">
     a signal and a beacon--a promise that the Old Times had passed away
    </p>

     forever--a covenant of the New.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96900">
     And, as the final explosion shattered the Temple of Bondage to wreckage,
    </p>

     flung it far into the rushing river and swept it over the leaping,

     thundering Falls, the news flashed on a thousand wires, to all cities

     and all lands; and though the mercenaries of the two dead world-masters

     Together in the doorway of the refuge at Port Colborne, Catherine stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96980">
     with Gabriel, watching the beacon of liberty upon the heavens. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_96990">
     light, a halo round her eager face, showed his powerful figure and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97000">
     smile of triumph in his eyes. His left arm, broken by the fall in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97010">
     aeroplane, now rested in a sling. His right, protecting in its strength,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97020">
     was round the girl. And as her head found shelter and rest, at length,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97030">
     upon his shoulder, she, too, smiled; and her eyes seemed to see visions
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97040">
     in the glory of the sky.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97060">
     "Visions!" said she, softly, as though voicing a universal thought. "Do
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97070">
     you behold them, too?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97090">
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97110">
     "Yes," he answered, "and they are beautiful and sweet and pure!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97130">
     "Visions that we now shall surely see?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97150">
     "Shall surely see!" he echoed; and a little silence fell. Far off, they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97160">
     seemed to hear a vast and thousand-throated cheering, that the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97170">
     night-wind brought to them in long and heart-inspiring cadences.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97190">
     "Gabriel," she said, at last.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97210">
     "Well?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97230">
     "I wish _he_ might have seen them, and have understood! In spite of all

     he did, and was, he was my father!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97260">
     "Yes," answered Gabriel, sensing her grief. "But would you have had him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97270">
     live through this? Live, with the whole world out of his grasp, again?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97280">
     Live, with all his plans wrecked and broken? Live on in this new time,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97290">
     where he could have comprehended nothing? Live on, in misery and rage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97300">
     and impotence?
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97320">
     "Your father was an old man, Catherine. You know as well as I
    </p>

     do--better, perhaps--the whole trend of his life's thought and ambition.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97340">
     Even if he'd lived, he couldn't have changed, now, at his age. It would
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97350">
     have been an utter impossibility. Why say more?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97370">
     Catherine made no reply; but in her very attitude of trust and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97380">
     confidence, Gabriel knew he read the comfort he had given her.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97400">
     Silence, a while. At last she spoke.

     "Visions!" she whispered. "Wonderful visions of the glad, new time! How
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97430">
     do you see them, Gabriel?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97450">
     "How do I see them?" His face seemed to glow with inspiration under the

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97460">
     shining light in the far heavens. "I see them as the realization of a

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97470">
     time, now really close at hand, when this old world of ours shall be, as
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97480">
     it never yet has been, in truth civilized, emancipated, free. When the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97490">
     night of ignorance, kingcraft, priestcraft, servility and prejudice,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97500">
     bigotry and superstition shall be forever swept away by the dawn of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97510">
     intelligence and universal education, by scientific truth and light--by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97520">
     understanding and by fearlessness.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97540">
     "When Science shall no longer be 'the mystery of a class,' but shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97550">
     become the heritage of all mankind. When, because much is known by all,

     nothing shall be dreaded by any. When all mankind shall be absolutely

     its own master, strong, and brave, and free!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97590">
     "Like you, Gabriel!" the girl exclaimed, from her heart.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97610">
     "Don't say that!" he disclaimed. "Don't--"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97630">
     She put her hand over his mouth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97650">
     "Shhhh!" she forbade him. "You mustn't argue, now, because your arm's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97660">
     just been set and we don't want any fever. If my dreams include you,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97670">
     too, Gabriel, don't try to tell me I'm mistaken--because I'm not, to

     begin with, and I _know_ I'm not!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97700">
     He laughed, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97720">
     "Do you realize," said he, "that when it comes to bravery, and strength,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97730">
     and the splendid freedom of an emancipated soul, I must look to _you_
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97740">
     for light and leading?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97760">
     "Don't!" she whispered. "Look only to the future--to the newer, better

     purloining whatsoever!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97850">
     "The future," he continued, as she paused, "when crowns, titles, swords,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97860">
     rifles and dreadnaughts shall be known only by history. When the earth

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97910">
     "Such have been my visions and my dreams, Catherine--a few of them. Now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97920">
     they are coming true! And other dreams and other visions--dreams of you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97930">
     and visions of our life together--what of them?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97950">
     "Why need you ask, Gabriel?" she answered, raising her lips to his.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000023_97970">
     The sound of singing, a triumphal chorus of the accomplished Revolution,

     a vast and million-throated song, seemed wafted to them on the wings of
