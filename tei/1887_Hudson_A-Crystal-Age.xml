   <p>
    A CRYSTAL AGE
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 1
   </p>
   <p>
    I do not quite know how it happened, my recollection of the whole matter
   </p>
   <p>
    ebbing in a somewhat clouded condition. I fancy I had gone somewhere on
   </p>
   <p>
    a botanizing expedition, but whether at home or abroad I don't know. At
   </p>
   <p>
    all events, I remember that I had taken up the study of plants with a
   </p>
   <p>
    good deal of enthusiasm, and that while hunting for some variety in the
   </p>
   <p>
    mountains I sat down to rest on the edge of a ravine. Perhaps it was on
   </p>
   <p>
    the ledge of an overhanging rock; anyhow, if I remember rightly, the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground gave way all about me, precipitating me below. The fall was a
   </p>
   <p>
    very considerable one--probably thirty or forty feet, or more, and I was
   </p>
   <p>
    rendered unconscious. How long I lay there under the heap of earth and
   </p>
   <p>
    stones carried down in my fall it is impossible to say: perhaps a long
   </p>
   <p>
    time; but at last I came to myself and struggled up from the
   </p>
   <p>
    debris, like a mole coming to the surface of the earth to feel
   </p>
   <p>
    the genial sunshine on his dim eyeballs. I found myself standing (oddly
   </p>
   <p>
    enough, on all fours) in an immense pit created by the overthrow of a
   </p>
   <p>
    gigantic dead tree with a girth of about thirty or forty feet. The tree
   </p>
   <p>
    itself had rolled down to the bottom of the ravine; but the pit in which
   </p>
   <p>
    it had left the huge stumps of severed roots was, I found, situated in a
   </p>
   <p>
    gentle slope at the top of the bank! How, then, I could have fallen
   </p>
   <p>
    seemingly so far from no height at all, puzzled me greatly: it looked as
   </p>
   <p>
    if the solid earth had been indulging in some curious transformation
   </p>
   <p>
    pranks during those moments or minutes of insensibility. Another
   </p>
   <p>
    singular circumstance was that I had a great mass of small fibrous
   </p>
   <p>
    rootlets tightly woven about my whole person, so that I was like a
   </p>
   <p>
    colossal basket-worm in its case, or a big man-shaped bottle covered
   </p>
   <p>
    with wicker-work. It appeared as if the roots had grown round me!
   </p>
   <p>
    Luckily they were quite sapless and brittle, and without bothering my
   </p>
   <p>
    brains too much about the matter, I set to work to rid myself of them.
   </p>
   <p>
    After stripping the woody covering off, I found that my tourist suit of
   </p>
   <p>
    rough Scotch homespun had not suffered much harm, although the cloth
   </p>
   <p>
    exuded a damp, moldy smell; also that my thick-soled climbing boots had
   </p>
   <p>
    assumed a cracked rusty appearance as if I had been engaged in some
   </p>
   <p>
    brick-field operations; while my felt hat was in such a discolored and
   </p>
   <p>
    battered condition that I felt almost ashamed to put it on my head. My
   </p>
   <p>
    watch was gone; perhaps I had not been wearing it, but my pocket-book in
   </p>
   <p>
    which I had my money was safe in my breast pocket.
   </p>
   <p>
    Glad and grateful at having escaped with unbroken bones from such a
   </p>
   <p>
    dangerous accident, I set out walking along the edge of the ravine,
   </p>
   <p>
    which soon broadened to a valley running between two steep hills; and
   </p>
   <p>
    then, seeing water at the bottom and feeling very dry, I ran down the
   </p>
   <p>
    slope to get a drink. Lying flat on my chest to slake my thirst animal
   </p>
   <p>
    fashion, I was amazed at the reflection the water gave back of my face:
   </p>
   <p>
    it was, skin and hair, thickly encrusted with clay and rootlets! Having
   </p>
   <p>
    taken a long drink, I threw off my clothes to have a bath; and after
   </p>
   <p>
    splashing about for half an hour managed to rid my skin of its
   </p>
   <p>
    accumulations of dirt. While drying in the wind I shook the loose sand
   </p>
   <p>
    and clay from my garments, then dressed, and, feeling greatly refreshed,
   </p>
   <p>
    proceeded on my walk.
   </p>
   <p>
    For an hour or so I followed the valley in its many windings, but,
   </p>
   <p>
    failing to see any dwelling-place, I ascended a hill to get a view of
   </p>
   <p>
    the surrounding country. The prospect which disclosed itself when I had
   </p>
   <p>
    got a couple of hundred feet above the surrounding level, appeared
   </p>
   <p>
    unfamiliar. The hills among which I had been wandering were now behind
   </p>
   <p>
    me; before me spread a wide rolling country, beyond which rose a
   </p>
   <p>
    mountain range resembling in the distance blue banked-up clouds with
   </p>
   <p>
    summits and peaks of pearly whiteness. Looking on this scene I could
   </p>
   <p>
    hardly refrain from shouting with joy, so glad did the sunlit expanse of
   </p>
   <p>
    earth, and the pure exhilarating mountain breeze, make me feel. The
   </p>
   <p>
    season was late summer--that was plain to see; the ground was moist, as
   </p>
   <p>
    if from recent showers, and the earth everywhere had that intense living
   </p>
   <p>
    greenness with which it reclothes itself when the greater heats are
   </p>
   <p>
    over; but the foliage of the woods was already beginning to be touched
   </p>
   <p>
    here and there with the yellow and russet hues of decay. A more tranquil
   </p>
   <p>
    and soul-satisfying scene could not be imagined: the dear old mother
   </p>
   <p>
    earth was looking her very best; while the shifting golden sunlight, the
   </p>
   <p>
    mysterious haze in the distance, and the glint of a wide stream not very
   </p>
   <p>
    far off, seemed to spiritualize her "happy autumn fields," and bring
   </p>
   <p>
    them into a closer kinship with the blue over-arching sky. There was one
   </p>
   <p>
    large house or mansion in sight, but no town, nor even a hamlet, and not
   </p>
   <p>
    one solitary spire. In vain I scanned the horizon, waiting impatiently
   </p>
   <p>
    to see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine. This
   </p>
   <p>
    troubled me not a little, for I had no idea that I had drifted so far
   </p>
   <p>
    from civilization in my search for specimens, or whatever it was that
   </p>
   <p>
    brought me to this pretty, primitive wilderness. Not quite a wilderness,
   </p>
   <p>
    however, for there, within a short hour's walk of the hill, stood the
   </p>
   <p>
    one great stone mansion, close to the river I had mentioned. There were
   </p>
   <p>
    also horses and cows in sight, and a number of scattered sheep were
   </p>
   <p>
    grazing on the hillside beneath me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Strange to relate, I met with a little misadventure on account of the
   </p>
   <p>
    sheep--an animal which one is accustomed to regard as of a timid and
   </p>
   <p>
    inoffensive nature. When I set out at a brisk pace to walk to the house
   </p>
   <p>
    I have spoken of, in order to make some inquiries there, a few of the
   </p>
   <p>
    sheep that happened to be near began to bleat loudly, as if alarmed, and
   </p>
   <p>
    by and by they came hurrying after me, apparently in a great state of
   </p>
   <p>
    excitement. I did not mind them much, but presently a pair of horses,
   </p>
   <p>
    attracted by their bleatings, also seemed struck at my appearance, and
   </p>
   <p>
    came at a swift gallop to within twenty yards of me. They were
   </p>
   <p>
    magnificent-looking brutes, evidently a pair of well-groomed carriage
   </p>
   <p>
    horses, for their coats, which were of a fine bronze color, sparkled
   </p>
   <p>
    wonderfully in the sunshine. In other respects they were very unlike
   </p>
   <p>
    carriage animals, for they had tails reaching to the ground, like
   </p>
   <p>
    funeral horses, and immense black leonine manes, which gave them a
   </p>
   <p>
    strikingly bold and somewhat formidable appearance. For some moments
   </p>
   <p>
    they stood with heads erect, gazing fixedly at me, and then
   </p>
   <p>
    simultaneously delivered a snort of defiance or astonishment, so loud
   </p>
   <p>
    and sudden that it startled me like the report of a gun. This tremendous
   </p>
   <p>
    equine blast brought yet another enemy on the field in the shape of a
   </p>
   <p>
    huge milk-white bull with long horns: a very noble kind of animal, but
   </p>
   <p>
    one which I always prefer to admire from behind a hedge, or at a
   </p>
   <p>
    distance through a field-glass. Fortunately his wrathful mutterings gave
   </p>
   <p>
    me timely notice of his approach, and without waiting to discover his
   </p>
   <p>
    intentions, I incontinently fled down the slope to the refuge of a grove
   </p>
   <p>
    or belt of trees clothing the lower portion of the hillside. Spent and
   </p>
   <p>
    panting from my run, I embraced a big tree, and turning to face the foe,
   </p>
   <p>
    found that I had not been followed: sheep, horses, and bull were all
   </p>
   <p>
    grouped together just where I had left them, apparently holding a
   </p>
   <p>
    consultation, or comparing notes.
   </p>
   <p>
    The trees where I had sought shelter were old, and grew here and there,
   </p>
   <p>
    singly or in scattered groups: it was a pretty wilderness of mingled
   </p>
   <p>
    tree, shrub and flower. I was surprised to find here some very large and
   </p>
   <p>
    ancient-looking fig-trees, and numbers of wasps and flies were busy
   </p>
   <p>
    feeding on a few over-ripe figs on the higher branches. Honey-bees also
   </p>
   <p>
    roamed about everywhere, extracting sweets from the autumn bloom, and
   </p>
   <p>
    filling the sunny glades with a soft, monotonous murmur of sound.
   </p>
   <p>
    Walking on full of happy thoughts and a keen sense of the sweetness of
   </p>
   <p>
    life pervading me, I presently noticed that a multitude of small birds
   </p>
   <p>
    were gathering about me, flitting through the trees overhead and the
   </p>
   <p>
    bushes on either hand, but always keeping near me, apparently as much
   </p>
   <p>
    excited at my presence as if I had been a gigantic owl, or some such
   </p>
   <p>
    unnatural monster. Their increasing numbers and incessant excited
   </p>
   <p>
    chirping and chattering at first served to amuse, but in the end began
   </p>
   <p>
    to irritate me. I observed, too, that the alarm was spreading, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    larger birds, usually shy of men--pigeons, jays, and magpies, I fancied
   </p>
   <p>
    they were--now began to make their appearance. Could it be, thought I
   </p>
   <p>
    with some concern, that I had wandered into some uninhabited wilderness,
   </p>
   <p>
    to cause so great a commotion among the little feathered people? I very
   </p>
   <p>
    soon dismissed this as an idle thought, for one does not find houses,
   </p>
   <p>
    domestic animals, and fruit-trees in desert places. No, it was simply
   </p>
   <p>
    the inherent cantankerousness of little birds which caused them to annoy
   </p>
   <p>
    me. Looking about on the ground for something to throw at them, I found
   </p>
   <p>
    in the grass a freshly-fallen walnut, and, breaking the shell, I quickly
   </p>
   <p>
    ate the contents. Never had anything tasted so pleasant to me before!
   </p>
   <p>
    But it had a curious effect on me, for, whereas before eating it I had
   </p>
   <p>
    not felt hungry, I now seemed to be famishing, and began excitedly
   </p>
   <p>
    searching about for more nuts. They were lying everywhere in the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest abundance; for, without knowing it, I had been walking through
   </p>
   <p>
    a grove composed in large part of old walnut-trees. Nut after nut was
   </p>
   <p>
    picked up and eagerly devoured, and I must have eaten four or five dozen
   </p>
   <p>
    before my ravenous appetite was thoroughly appeased. During this feast I
   </p>
   <p>
    had paid no attention to the birds, but when my hunger was over I began
   </p>
   <p>
    again to feel annoyed at their trivial persecutions, and so continued to
   </p>
   <p>
    gather the fallen nuts to throw at them. It amused and piqued me at the
   </p>
   <p>
    same time to see how wide of the mark my missiles went. I could hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    have hit a haystack at a distance of ten yards. After half an hour's
   </p>
   <p>
    vigorous practice my right hand began to recover its lost cunning, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    was at last greatly delighted when of my nuts went hissing like a bullet
   </p>
   <p>
    through the leaves, not further than a yard from the wren, or whatever
   </p>
   <p>
    the little beggar was, I had aimed at. Their Impertinences did not like
   </p>
   <p>
    this at all; they began to find out that I was a rather dangerous person
   </p>
   <p>
    to meddle with: their ranks were broken, they became demoralized and
   </p>
   <p>
    scattered, in all directions, and I was finally left master of the
   </p>
   <p>
    field.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Dolt that I am," I suddenly exclaimed, "to be fooling away my time when
   </p>
   <p>
    the nearest railway station or hotel is perhaps twenty miles away."
   </p>
   <p>
    I hurried on, but when I got to the end of the grove, on the green sward
   </p>
   <p>
    near some laurel and juniper bushes, I came on an excavation apparently
   </p>
   <p>
    just made, the loose earth which had been dug out looking quite fresh
   </p>
   <p>
    and moist. The hole or foss was narrow, about five feet deep and seven
   </p>
   <p>
    feet long, and looked, I imagined, curiously like a grave. A few yards
   </p>
   <p>
    away was a pile of dry brushwood, and some faggots bound together with
   </p>
   <p>
    ropes of straw, all apparently freshly cut from the neighboring bushes.
   </p>
   <p>
    As I stood there, wondering what these things meant, I happened to
   </p>
   <p>
    glance away in the direction of the house where I intended to call,
   </p>
   <p>
    which was not now visible owing to an intervening grove of tall trees,
   </p>
   <p>
    and was surprised to discover a troop of about fifteen persons advancing
   </p>
   <p>
    along the valley in my direction. Before them marched a tall
   </p>
   <p>
    white-bearded old man; next came eight men, bearing a platform on their
   </p>
   <p>
    shoulders with some heavy burden resting upon it; and behind these
   </p>
   <p>
    followed the others. I began to think that they were actually carrying a
   </p>
   <p>
    corpse, with the intention of giving it burial in that very pit beside
   </p>
   <p>
    which I was standing; and, although it looked most unlike a funeral, for
   </p>
   <p>
    no person in the procession wore black, the thought strengthened to a
   </p>
   <p>
    conviction when I became able to distinguish a recumbent, human-like
   </p>
   <p>
    form in a shroud-like covering on the platform. It seemed altogether a
   </p>
   <p>
    very unusual proceeding, and made me feel extremely uncomfortable; so
   </p>
   <p>
    much so that I considered it prudent to step back behind the bushes,
   </p>
   <p>
    where I could watch the doings of the processionists without being
   </p>
   <p>
    observed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Led by the old man--who carried, suspended by thin chains, a large
   </p>
   <p>
    bronze censer, or brazier rather, which sent out a thin continuous
   </p>
   <p>
    wreath of smoke--they came straight on to the pit; and after depositing
   </p>
   <p>
    their burden on the grass, remained standing for some minutes,
   </p>
   <p>
    apparently to rest after their walk, all conversing together, but in
   </p>
   <p>
    subdued tones, so that I could not catch their words, although standing
   </p>
   <p>
    within fifteen yards of the grave. The uncoffined corpse, which seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    that of a full-grown man, was covered with a white cloth, and rested on
   </p>
   <p>
    a thick straw mat, provided with handles along the sides. On these
   </p>
   <p>
    things, however, I bestowed but a hasty glance, so profoundly absorbed
   </p>
   <p>
    had I become in watching the group of living human beings before me; for
   </p>
   <p>
    they were certainly utterly unlike any fellow-creatures I had ever
   </p>
   <p>
    encountered before. The old man was tall and spare, and from his
   </p>
   <p>
    snowy-white majestic beard I took him to be about seventy years old; but
   </p>
   <p>
    he was straight as an arrow, and his free movements and elastic tread
   </p>
   <p>
    were those of a much younger man. His head was adorned with a dark red
   </p>
   <p>
    skull-cap, and he wore a robe covering the whole body and reaching to
   </p>
   <p>
    the ankles, of a deep yellow or rhubarb color; but his long wide sleeves
   </p>
   <p>
    under his robe were dark red, embroidered with yellow flowers. The other
   </p>
   <p>
    men had no covering on their heads, and their luxuriant hair, worn to
   </p>
   <p>
    the shoulders, was, in most cases, very dark. Their garments were also
   </p>
   <p>
    made in a different fashion, and consisted of a kilt-like dress, which
   </p>
   <p>
    came half-way to the knees, a pale yellow shirt fitting tight to the
   </p>
   <p>
    skin, and over it a loose sleeveless vest. The entire legs were cased in
   </p>
   <p>
    stockings, curious in pattern and color. The women wore garments
   </p>
   <p>
    resembling those of the men, but the tight-fitting sleeves reached only
   </p>
   <p>
    half-way to the elbow, the rest of the arm being bare; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    outergarment was all in one piece, resembling a long sleeveless jacket,
   </p>
   <p>
    reaching below the hips. The color of their dresses varied, but in most
   </p>
   <p>
    cases different shades of blue and subdued yellow predominated. In all,
   </p>
   <p>
    the stockings showed deeper and richer shades of color than the other
   </p>
   <p>
    garments; and in their curiously segmented appearance, and in the
   </p>
   <p>
    harmonious arrangement of the tints, they seemed to represent the skins
   </p>
   <p>
    of pythons and other beautifully variegated serpents. All wore low shoes
   </p>
   <p>
    of an orange-brown color, fitting closely so as to display the shape of
   </p>
   <p>
    the foot.
   </p>
   <p>
    From the moment of first seeing them I had had no doubt about the sex of
   </p>
   <p>
    the tall old leader of the procession, his shining white beard being as
   </p>
   <p>
    conspicuous at a distance as a shield or a banner; but looking at the
   </p>
   <p>
    others I was at first puzzled to know whether the party was composed of
   </p>
   <p>
    men or women, or of both, so much did they resemble each other in
   </p>
   <p>
    height, in their smooth faces, and in the length of their hair. On a
   </p>
   <p>
    closer inspection I noticed the difference of dress of the sexes; also
   </p>
   <p>
    that the men, if not sterner, had faces at all events less mild and soft
   </p>
   <p>
    in expression than the women, and also a slight perceptible down on the
   </p>
   <p>
    cheeks and upper lip.
   </p>
   <p>
    After a first hasty survey of the group in general, I had eyes for only
   </p>
   <p>
    one person in it--a fine graceful girl about fourteen years old, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    youngest by far of the party. A description of this girl will give some
   </p>
   <p>
    idea, albeit a very poor one, of the faces and general appearance of
   </p>
   <p>
    this strange people I had stumbled on. Her dress, if a garment so brief
   </p>
   <p>
    can be called a dress, showed a slaty-blue pattern on a straw-colored
   </p>
   <p>
    ground, while her stockings were darker shades of the same colors. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes, at the distance I stood from her, appeared black, or nearly black,
   </p>
   <p>
    but when seen closely they proved to be green--a wonderfully pure,
   </p>
   <p>
    tender sea-green; and the others, I found, had eyes of the same hue. Her
   </p>
   <p>
    hair fell to her shoulders; but it was very wavy or curly, and strayed
   </p>
   <p>
    in small tendril-like tresses over her neck, forehead and cheeks; in
   </p>
   <p>
    color it was golden black--that is, black in shade, but when touched
   </p>
   <p>
    with sunlight every hair became a thread of shining red-gold; and in
   </p>
   <p>
    some lights it looked like raven-black hair powdered with gold-dust. As
   </p>
   <p>
    to her features, the forehead was broader and lower, the nose larger,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the lips more slender, than in our most beautiful female types. The
   </p>
   <p>
    color was also different, the delicately molded mouth being purple-red
   </p>
   <p>
    instead of the approved cherry or coral hue; while the complexion was a
   </p>
   <p>
    clear dark, and the color, which mantled the cheeks in moments of
   </p>
   <p>
    excitement, was a dim or dusky rather than a rosy red.
   </p>
   <p>
    The exquisite form and face of this young girl, from the first moment of
   </p>
   <p>
    seeing her, produced a very deep impression; and I continued watching
   </p>
   <p>
    her every movement and gesture with an intense, even a passionate
   </p>
   <p>
    interest. She had a quantity of flowers in her hand; but these sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    emblems, I observed, were all gayly colored, which seemed strange, for
   </p>
   <p>
    in most places white flowers are used in funeral ceremonies. Some of the
   </p>
   <p>
    men who had followed the body carried in their hands broad,
   </p>
   <p>
    three-cornered bronze shovels, with short black handles, and these they
   </p>
   <p>
    had dropped upon the grass on arriving at the grave. Presently the old
   </p>
   <p>
    man stooped and drew the covering back from the dead one's face--a
   </p>
   <p>
    rigid, marble-white face set in a loose mass of black hair. The others
   </p>
   <p>
    gathered round, and some standing, others kneeling, bent on the still
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance before them a long earnest gaze, as if taking an eternal
   </p>
   <p>
    farewell of one they had deeply loved. At this moment the the beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    girl I have described all at once threw herself with a sobbing cry on
   </p>
   <p>
    her knees before the corpse, and, stooping, kissed the face with
   </p>
   <p>
    passionate grief. "Oh, my beloved, must we now leave you alone forever!"
   </p>
   <p>
    she cried between the sobs that shook her whole frame. "Oh, my love--my
   </p>
   <p>
    love--my love, will you come back to us no more!"
   </p>
   <p>
    The others all appeared deeply affected at her grief, and presently a
   </p>
   <p>
    young man standing by raised her from the ground and drew her gently
   </p>
   <p>
    against his side, where for some minutes she continued convulsively
   </p>
   <p>
    weeping. Some of the other men now passed ropes through the handles of
   </p>
   <p>
    the straw mat on which the corpse rested, and raising it from the
   </p>
   <p>
    platform lowered it into the foss. Each person in turn then advanced and
   </p>
   <p>
    dropped some flowers into the grave, uttering the one word "Farewell" as
   </p>
   <p>
    they did so; after which the loose earth was shoveled in with the bronze
   </p>
   <p>
    implements. Over the mound the hurdle on which the straw mat had rested
   </p>
   <p>
    was then placed, the dry brushwood and faggots heaped over it and
   </p>
   <p>
    ignited with a coal from the brazier. White smoke and crackling flames
   </p>
   <p>
    issued anon from the pile, and in a few moments the whole was in a
   </p>
   <p>
    fierce blaze.
   </p>
   <p>
    Standing around they all waited in silence until the fire had burnt
   </p>
   <p>
    itself out; then the old man advancing stretched his arms above the
   </p>
   <p>
    white and still smoking ashes and cried in a loud voice: "Farewell
   </p>
   <p>
    forever, O well beloved son! With deep sorrow and tears we have given
   </p>
   <p>
    you back to Earth; but not until she has made the sweet grass and
   </p>
   <p>
    flowers grow again on this spot, scorched and made desolate with fire,
   </p>
   <p>
    shall our hearts be healed of their wound and forget their grief."
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 2
   </p>
   <p>
    The thrilling, pathetic tone in which these words were uttered affected
   </p>
   <p>
    me not a little; and when the ceremony was over I continued staring
   </p>
   <p>
    vacantly at the speaker, ignorant of the fact that the beautiful young
   </p>
   <p>
    girl had her wide-open, startled eyes fixed on the bush which, I vainly
   </p>
   <p>
    imagined, concealed me from view.
   </p>
   <p>
    All at once she cried out: "Oh, father, look there! Who is that
   </p>
   <p>
    strange-looking man watching us from behind the bushes?"
   </p>
   <p>
    They all turned, and then I felt that fourteen or fifteen pairs of very
   </p>
   <p>
    keen eyes were on me, seeing me very plainly indeed, for in my curiosity
   </p>
   <p>
    and excitement I had come out from the thicker bushes to place myself
   </p>
   <p>
    behind a ragged, almost leafless shrub, which afforded the merest
   </p>
   <p>
    apology for a shelter. Putting a bold face on the matter, although I did
   </p>
   <p>
    not feel very easy, I came out and advanced to them, removing my
   </p>
   <p>
    battered old hat on the way, and bowing repeatedly to the assembled
   </p>
   <p>
    company. My courteous salutation was not returned; but all, with
   </p>
   <p>
    increasing astonishment pictured on their faces, continued staring at me
   </p>
   <p>
    as if they were looking on some grotesque apparition. Thinking it best
   </p>
   <p>
    to give an account of myself at once, and to apologize for intruding on
   </p>
   <p>
    their mysteries, I addressed myself to the old man:
   </p>
   <p>
    "I really beg your pardon," I said, "for having disturbed you at such an
   </p>
   <p>
    inconvenient time, and while you are engaged in these--these solemn
   </p>
   <p>
    rites; but I assure you, sir, it has been quite accidental. I happened
   </p>
   <p>
    to be walking here when I saw you coming, and thought it best to step
   </p>
   <p>
    out of the way until--well, until the funeral was over. The fact is, I
   </p>
   <p>
    met with a serious accident in the mountains over there. I fell down
   </p>
   <p>
    into a ravine, and a great heap of earth and stones fell on and stunned
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and I do not know how long I lay there before I recovered my senses.
   </p>
   <p>
    I daresay I am trespassing, but I am a perfect stranger here, and quite
   </p>
   <p>
    lost, and--and perhaps a little confused after my fall, and perhaps you
   </p>
   <p>
    will kindly tell me where to go to get some refreshment, and find out
   </p>
   <p>
    where I am."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Your story is a very strange one," said the old man in reply, after a
   </p>
   <p>
    pause of considerable duration. "That you are a perfect stranger in this
   </p>
   <p>
    place is evident from your appearance, your uncouth dress, and your
   </p>
   <p>
    thick speech."
   </p>
   <p>
    His words made me blush hotly, although I should not have minded his
   </p>
   <p>
    very personal remarks much if that beautiful girl had not been standing
   </p>
   <p>
    there listening to everything. My uncouth garments, by the way,
   </p>
   <p>
    were made by a fashionable West End tailor, and fitted me perfectly,
   </p>
   <p>
    although just now they were, of course, very dirty. It was also a
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise to hear that I had a thick speech, since I had always
   </p>
   <p>
    been considered a remarkably clear speaker and good singer, and had
   </p>
   <p>
    frequently both sung and recited in public, at amateur entertainments.
   </p>
   <p>
    After a distressing interval of silence, during which they all continued
   </p>
   <p>
    regarding me with unabated curiosity, the old gentleman condescended to
   </p>
   <p>
    address me again and asked me my name and country.
   </p>
   <p>
    "My country," said I, with the natural pride of a Briton, "is England,
   </p>
   <p>
    and my name is Smith."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No such country is known to me," he returned; "nor have I ever heard
   </p>
   <p>
    such a name as yours."
   </p>
   <p>
    I was rather taken aback at his words, and yet did not just then by any
   </p>
   <p>
    means realize their full import. I was thinking only about my name; for
   </p>
   <p>
    without having penetrated into any perfectly savage country, I had been
   </p>
   <p>
    about the world a great deal for a young man, visiting the Colonies,
   </p>
   <p>
    India, Yokohama, and other distant places, and I had never yet been told
   </p>
   <p>
    that the name of Smith was an unfamiliar one.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I hardly know what to say," I returned, for he was evidently waiting
   </p>
   <p>
    for me to add something more to what I had stated. "It rather staggers
   </p>
   <p>
    me to hear that my name-well, you have not heard of me, of
   </p>
   <p>
    course, but there have been a great many distinguished men of the same
   </p>
   <p>
    name: Sydney Smith, for instance, and--and several others." It mortified
   </p>
   <p>
    me just then to find that I had forgotten all the other distinguished
   </p>
   <p>
    Smiths.
   </p>
   <p>
    He shook his head, and continued watching my face.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Not heard of them!" I exclaimed. "Well, I suppose you have heard of
   </p>
   <p>
    some of my great countrymen: Beaconsfield, Gladstone, Darwin,
   </p>
   <p>
    Burne-Jones, Ruskin, Queen Victoria, Tennyson, George Eliot, Herbert
   </p>
   <p>
    Spencer, General Gordon, Lord Randolph Churchill--"
   </p>
   <p>
    As he continued to shake his head after each name I at length paused.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Who are all these people you have named?" he asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    "They are all great and illustrious men and women who have a world-wide
   </p>
   <p>
    reputation," I answered.
   </p>
   <p>
    "And are there no more of them--have you told me the names of all
   </p>
   <p>
    the great people you have ever known or heard of?" he said, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    curious smile.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, indeed," I answered, nettled at his words and manner. "It would
   </p>
   <p>
    take me until to-morrow to name all the great men I have ever
   </p>
   <p>
    heard of. I suppose you have heard the names of Napoleon, Wellington,
   </p>
   <p>
    Nelson, Dante, Luther, Calvin, Bismarck, Voltaire?"
   </p>
   <p>
    He still shook his head.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, then," I continued, "Homer, Socrates, Alexander the Great,
   </p>
   <p>
    Confucius, Zoroaster, Plato, Shakespeare." Then, growing thoroughly
   </p>
   <p>
    desperate, I added in a burst: "Noah, Moses, Columbus, Hannibal, Adam
   </p>
   <p>
    and Eve!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am quite sure that I have never heard of any of these names," he
   </p>
   <p>
    answered, still with that curious smile. "Nevertheless I can understand
   </p>
   <p>
    your surprise. It sometimes happens that the mind, owing an an imperfect
   </p>
   <p>
    adjustment of its faculties, resembles the uneducated vision in its
   </p>
   <p>
    method of judgment, regarding the things which are near as great and
   </p>
   <p>
    important, and those further away as less important, according to their
   </p>
   <p>
    distance. In such a case the individuals one hears about or associates
   </p>
   <p>
    with, come to be looked upon as the great and illustrious beings of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, and all men in all places are expected to be familiar with their
   </p>
   <p>
    names. But come, my children, our sorrowful task is over, let us now
   </p>
   <p>
    return to the house. Come with us, Smith, and you shall have the
   </p>
   <p>
    refreshment you require."
   </p>
   <p>
    I was, of course, pleased with the invitation, but did not relish being
   </p>
   <p>
    addressed as "Smith," like some mere laborer or other common person
   </p>
   <p>
    tramping about the country.
   </p>
   <p>
    The long disconcerting scrutiny I had been subjected to had naturally
   </p>
   <p>
    made me very uncomfortable, and caused me to drop a little behind the
   </p>
   <p>
    others as we walked towards the house. The old man, however, still kept
   </p>
   <p>
    at my side; but whether from motives of courtesy, or because he wished
   </p>
   <p>
    to badger me a little more about my uncouth appearance and defective
   </p>
   <p>
    intellect, I was not sure. I was not anxious to continue the
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation, which had not proved very satisfactory; moreover, the
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful girl I have already mentioned so frequently, was now walking
   </p>
   <p>
    just before me, hand in hand with the young man who had raised her from
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground. I was absorbed in admiration of her graceful figure,
   </p>
   <p>
    and--shall I be forgiven for mentioning such a detail?--her exquisitely
   </p>
   <p>
    rounded legs under her brief and beautiful garments. To my mind the
   </p>
   <p>
    garment was quite long enough. Every time I spoke, for my companion
   </p>
   <p>
    still maintained the conversation and I was obliged to reply, she hung
   </p>
   <p>
    back a little to catch my words. At such times she would also turn her
   </p>
   <p>
    pretty head partially round so as to see me: then her glances, beginning
   </p>
   <p>
    at my face, would wander down to my legs, and her lips would twitch and
   </p>
   <p>
    curl a little, seeming to express disgust and amusement at the same
   </p>
   <p>
    time. I was beginning to hate my legs, or rather my trousers, for I
   </p>
   <p>
    considered that under them I had as good a pair of calves as any man in
   </p>
   <p>
    the company.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently I thought of something to say, something very simple, which my
   </p>
   <p>
    dignified old friend would be able to answer without intimating that he
   </p>
   <p>
    considered me a wild man of the woods or an escaped lunatic.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Can you tell me," I said pleasantly, "what is the name of your nearest
   </p>
   <p>
    town or city? how far it is from this place, and how I can get there?"
   </p>
   <p>
    At this question, or series of questions, the young girl turned quite
   </p>
   <p>
    round, and, waiting until I was even with her, she continued her walk at
   </p>
   <p>
    my side, although still holding her companion's hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    The old man looked at me with a grave smile--that smile was fast
   </p>
   <p>
    becoming intolerable--and said: "Are you so fond of honey, Smith? You
   </p>
   <p>
    shall have as much as you require without disturbing the bees. They are
   </p>
   <p>
    now taking advantage of this second spring to lay by a sufficient
   </p>
   <p>
    provision before winter sets in."
   </p>
   <p>
    After pondering some time over these enigmatical words, I said: "I
   </p>
   <p>
    daresay we are at cross purposes again. I mean," I added hurriedly,
   </p>
   <p>
    seeing the inquiring look on his face, "that we do not exactly
   </p>
   <p>
    understand each other, for the subject of honey was not in my thoughts."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What, then, do you mean by a city?" he asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What do I mean? Why, a city, I take it, is nothing more than a
   </p>
   <p>
    collection or congeries of houses--hundreds and thousands, or hundreds
   </p>
   <p>
    of thousands of houses, all built close together, where one can
   </p>
   <p>
    live very comfortably for years without seeing a blade of grass."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am afraid," he returned, "that the accident you met with in the
   </p>
   <p>
    mountains must have caused some injury to your brain; for I cannot in
   </p>
   <p>
    any other way account for these strange fantasies."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you mean seriously to tell me, sir, that you have never even heard
   </p>
   <p>
    of the existence of a city, where millions of human beings live crowded
   </p>
   <p>
    together in a small space? Of course I mean a small space comparatively;
   </p>
   <p>
    for in some cities you might walk all day without getting into the
   </p>
   <p>
    fields; and a city like that might be compared to a beehive so large
   </p>
   <p>
    that a bee might fly in a straight line all day without getting out of
   </p>
   <p>
    it."
   </p>
   <p>
    It struck me the moment I finished speaking that this comparison was not
   </p>
   <p>
    quite right somehow; but he did not ask me to explain: he had evidently
   </p>
   <p>
    ceased to pay any attention to what I said. The girl looked at me with
   </p>
   <p>
    an expression of pity, not to say contempt, and I felt at the same time
   </p>
   <p>
    ashamed and vexed. This served to rouse a kind of dogged spirit in me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I returned to the subject once more.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Surely," I said, "you have heard of such cities as Paris, Vienna, Rome,
   </p>
   <p>
    Athens, Babylon, Jerusalem?"
   </p>
   <p>
    He only shook his head, and walked on in silence.
   </p>
   <p>
    "And London! London is the capital of England. Why," I exclaimed,
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning to see light, and wondering at myself for not having seen it
   </p>
   <p>
    sooner, "you are at present talking to me in the English language."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I fail to understand your meaning, and am even inclined to doubt that
   </p>
   <p>
    you have any," said he, a little ruffled. "I am addressing you in the
   </p>
   <p>
    language of human beings--that is all."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, it seems awfully puzzling," said I; "but I hope you don't think I
   </p>
   <p>
    have been indulging in--well, tarradiddles." Then, seeing that I was
   </p>
   <p>
    making matters no clearer, I added: "I mean that I have not been telling
   </p>
   <p>
    untruths."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I could not think that," he answered sternly. "It would indeed be a
   </p>
   <p>
    clouded mind which could mistake mere disordered fancies for willful
   </p>
   <p>
    offenses against the truth. I have no doubt that when you have recovered
   </p>
   <p>
    from the effects of your late accident these vain thoughts and
   </p>
   <p>
    imaginations will cease to trouble you."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And in the meantime, perhaps, I had better say as little as possible,"
   </p>
   <p>
    said I, with considerable temper. "At present we do not seem able to
   </p>
   <p>
    understand each other at all."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You are right, we do not," he said; and then added with a grave smile,
   </p>
   <p>
    "although I must allow that this last remark of yours is quite
   </p>
   <p>
    intelligible."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I'm glad of that," I returned. "It is distressing to talk and not to be
   </p>
   <p>
    understood; it is like men calling to each other in a high wind, hearing
   </p>
   <p>
    voices but not able to distinguish words."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Again I understand you," said he approvingly; while the beautiful girl
   </p>
   <p>
    bestowed on me the coveted reward of a smile, which had no pity or
   </p>
   <p>
    contempt in it.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I think," I continued, determined to follow up this new train of ideas
   </p>
   <p>
    on which I had so luckily stumbled, "that we are not so far apart in
   </p>
   <p>
    mind after all. About some things we stand quite away from each other,
   </p>
   <p>
    like the widely diverging branches of a tree; but, like the branches, we
   </p>
   <p>
    have a meeting-place, and this is, I fancy, in that part of our nature
   </p>
   <p>
    where our feelings are. My accident in the hills has not disarranged
   </p>
   <p>
    that part of me, I am sure, and I can give you an instance. A little
   </p>
   <p>
    while ago when I was standing behind the bushes watching you all, I saw
   </p>
   <p>
    this young lady----"
   </p>
   <p>
    Here a look of surprise and inquiry from the girl warned me that I was
   </p>
   <p>
    once more plunging into obscurity.
   </p>
   <p>
    "When I saw you," I continued, somewhat amused at her manner,
   </p>
   <p>
    "cast yourself on the earth to kiss the cold face of one you had loved
   </p>
   <p>
    in life, I felt the tears of sympathy come to my own eyes."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, how strange!" she exclaimed, flashing on me a glance from her
   </p>
   <p>
    green, mysterious eyes; and then, to increase my wonder and delight, she
   </p>
   <p>
    deliberately placed her hand in mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    "And yet not strange," said the old man, by way of comment on her words.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It seemed strange to Yoletta that one so unlike us outwardly should be
   </p>
   <p>
    so like us in heart," remarked the young man at her side.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was something about this speech which I did not altogether like,
   </p>
   <p>
    though I could not detect anything like sarcasm in the tone of the
   </p>
   <p>
    speaker.
   </p>
   <p>
    "And yet," continued the lovely girl, "you never saw him living--never
   </p>
   <p>
    heard his sweet voice, which still seems to come back to me like a
   </p>
   <p>
    melody from the distance."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Was he your father?" I asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    The question seemed to surprise her very much. "He is our
   </p>
   <p>
    father," she returned, with a glance at the old gentleman, which seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    strange, for he certainly looked aged enough to be her great-grandfather.
   </p>
   <p>
    He smiled and said: "You forget, my daughter, that I am as little known
   </p>
   <p>
    to this stranger to our country as all the great and illustrious
   </p>
   <p>
    personages he has mentioned are to us."
   </p>
   <p>
    At this point I began to lose interest in the conversation. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    enough for me to feel that I held that precious hand in mine, and
   </p>
   <p>
    presently I felt tempted to administer a gentle squeeze. She looked at
   </p>
   <p>
    me and smiled, then glanced over my whole person, the survey finishing
   </p>
   <p>
    at my boots, which seemed to have a disagreeable fascination for her.
   </p>
   <p>
    She shivered slightly, and withdrew her hand from mine, and in my heart
   </p>
   <p>
    I cursed those rusty, thick-soled monstrosities in which my feet were
   </p>
   <p>
    cased. However, we were all on a better footing now; and I resolved for
   </p>
   <p>
    the future to avoid all dangerous topics, historical and geographical,
   </p>
   <p>
    and confine myself to subjects relating to the emotional side of our
   </p>
   <p>
    natures.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the end our way to the house was over a green turf, among great trees
   </p>
   <p>
    as in a park; and as there was no road or path, the first sight of the
   </p>
   <p>
    building seen near, when we emerged from the trees, came as a surprise.
   </p>
   <p>
    There were no gardens, lawns, inclosures or hedges near it, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    cultivation of any kind. It was like a wilderness, and the house
   </p>
   <p>
    produced the effect of a noble ruin. It was a hilly stone country where
   </p>
   <p>
    masses of stone cropped out here and there among the woods and on the
   </p>
   <p>
    green slopes, and it appeared that the house had been raised on the
   </p>
   <p>
    natural foundation of one of these rocks standing a little above the
   </p>
   <p>
    river that flowed behind it. The stone was gray, tinged with red, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the whole rock, covering an acre or so of ground, had been worn or hewn
   </p>
   <p>
    down to form a vast platform which stood about a dozen feet above the
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounding green level. The sloping and buttressed sides of the
   </p>
   <p>
    platform were clothed with ivy, wild shrubs, and various flowering
   </p>
   <p>
    plants. Broad, shallow steps led up to the house, which was all of the
   </p>
   <p>
    same material--reddish-gray stone; and the main entrance was beneath a
   </p>
   <p>
    lofty portico, the sculptured entablature of which was supported by
   </p>
   <p>
    sixteen huge caryatides, standing on round massive pedestals. The
   </p>
   <p>
    building was not high as a castle or cathedral; it was a dwelling-place,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had but one floor, and resembled a ruin to my eyes because of the
   </p>
   <p>
    extreme antiquity of its appearance, the weather-worn condition and
   </p>
   <p>
    massiveness of the sculptured surfaces, and the masses of ancient ivy
   </p>
   <p>
    covering it in places. On the central portion of the building rested a
   </p>
   <p>
    great dome-shaped roof, resembling ground glass of a pale reddish tint,
   </p>
   <p>
    producing the effect of a cloud resting on the stony summit of a hill.
   </p>
   <p>
    I remained standing on the grass about thirty yards from the first steps
   </p>
   <p>
    after the others had gone in, all but the old gentleman, who still kept
   </p>
   <p>
    with me. By-and-by, withdrawing to a stone bench under an oak-tree, he
   </p>
   <p>
    motioned to me to take a seat by his side. He said nothing, but appeared
   </p>
   <p>
    to be quietly enjoying my undisguised surprise and admiration.
   </p>
   <p>
    "A noble mansion!" I remarked at length to my venerable host, feeling,
   </p>
   <p>
    Englishman-like, a sudden great access of respect towards the owner of a
   </p>
   <p>
    big house. Men in such a position can afford to be as eccentric as they
   </p>
   <p>
    like, even to the wearing of Carnivalesque garments, burying their
   </p>
   <p>
    friends or relations in a park, and shaking their heads over such names
   </p>
   <p>
    as Smith or Shakespeare. "A glorious place! It must have cost a pot of
   </p>
   <p>
    money, and taken a long time to build."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What you mean by a pot of money I do not know," said he. "When
   </p>
   <p>
    you add a long time to build, I am also puzzled to understand
   </p>
   <p>
    you. For are not all houses, like the forest of trees, the human race,
   </p>
   <p>
    the world we live in, eternal?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "If they stand forever they are so in one sense, I suppose," I answered,
   </p>
   <p>
    beginning to fear that I had already unfortunately broken the rule I had
   </p>
   <p>
    so recently laid down for my own guidance. "But the trees of the forest,
   </p>
   <p>
    to which you compare a house, spring from seed, do they not? and so have
   </p>
   <p>
    a beginning. Their end also, like the end of man, is to die and return
   </p>
   <p>
    to the dust."
   </p>
   <p>
    "That is true," he returned; "it is, moreover, a truth which I do not
   </p>
   <p>
    now hear for the first time; but it has no connection with the subject
   </p>
   <p>
    we are discussing. Men pass away, and others take their places. Trees
   </p>
   <p>
    also decay, but the forest does not die, or suffer for the loss of
   </p>
   <p>
    individual trees; is it not the same with the house and the family
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabiting it, which is one with the house, and endures forever, albeit
   </p>
   <p>
    the members composing it must all in time return to the dust?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Is there no decay, then, of the materials composing a house?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Assuredly there is! Even the hardest stone is worn in time by the
   </p>
   <p>
    elements, or by the footsteps of many generations of men; but the stone
   </p>
   <p>
    that decays is removed, and the house does not suffer."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I have never looked at it quite in this light before," said I. "But
   </p>
   <p>
    surely we can build a house whenever we wish!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Build a house whenever we wish!" he repeated, with that astonished look
   </p>
   <p>
    which threatened to become the permanent expression of his face--so long
   </p>
   <p>
    as he had me to talk with, at any rate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, or pull one down if we find it unsuitable--" But his look of
   </p>
   <p>
    horror here made me pause, and to finish the sentence I added: "Of
   </p>
   <p>
    course, you must admit that a house had a beginning?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes; and so had the forest, the mountain, the human race, the world
   </p>
   <p>
    itself. But the origin of all these things is covered with the mists of
   </p>
   <p>
    time."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Does it never happen, then, that a house, however substantially
   </p>
   <p>
    built--"
   </p>
   <p>
    "However what! But never mind; you continue to speak in riddles. Pray,
   </p>
   <p>
    finish what you were saying."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Does it never happen that a house is overthrown by some natural
   </p>
   <p>
    force--by floods, or subsidence of the earth, or is destroyed by
   </p>
   <p>
    lightning or fire?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No!" he answered, with such tremendous emphasis that he almost made me
   </p>
   <p>
    jump from my seat. "Are you alone so ignorant of these things that you
   </p>
   <p>
    speak of building and of pulling down a house?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, I fancied I knew a lot of things once," I answered, with a sigh.
   </p>
   <p>
    "But perhaps I was mistaken--people often are. I should like to hear you
   </p>
   <p>
    say something more about all these things--I mean about the house and
   </p>
   <p>
    the family, and the rest of it."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Are you not, then, able to read--have you been taught absolutely
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh yes, certainly I can read," I answered, joyfully seizing at once on
   </p>
   <p>
    the suggestion, which seemed to open a simple, pleasant way of escape
   </p>
   <p>
    from the difficulty. "I am by no means a studious person; perhaps I am
   </p>
   <p>
    never so happy as when I have nothing to read. Nevertheless, I do
   </p>
   <p>
    occasionally look into books, and greatly appreciate their gentle,
   </p>
   <p>
    kindly ways. They never shut themselves up with a sound like a slap, or
   </p>
   <p>
    throw themselves at your head for a duffer, but seem silently grateful
   </p>
   <p>
    for being read, even by a stupid person, and teach you very patiently,
   </p>
   <p>
    like a pretty, meek-spirited young girl."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am very pleased to hear it," said he. "You shall read and learn all
   </p>
   <p>
    these things for yourself, which is the best method. Or perhaps I ought
   </p>
   <p>
    rather to say, you shall by reading recall them to your mind, for it is
   </p>
   <p>
    impossible to believe that it has always been in its present pitiable
   </p>
   <p>
    condition. I can only attribute such a mental state, with its disordered
   </p>
   <p>
    fancies about cities, or immense hives of human beings, and other things
   </p>
   <p>
    equally frightful to contemplate, and its absolute vacancy concerning
   </p>
   <p>
    ordinary matters of knowledge, to the grave accident you met with in the
   </p>
   <p>
    hills. Doubtless in falling your head was struck and injured by a stone.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let us hope that you will soon recover possession of your memory and
   </p>
   <p>
    other faculties. And now let us repair to the eating-room, for it is
   </p>
   <p>
    best to refresh the body first, and the mind afterwards."
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 3
   </p>
   <p>
    We ascended the steps, and passing through the portico went into the
   </p>
   <p>
    hall by what seemed to me a doorless way. It was not really so, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered later; the doors, of which there were several, some of
   </p>
   <p>
    colored glass, others of some other material, were simply thrust back
   </p>
   <p>
    into receptacles within the wall itself, which was five or six feet
   </p>
   <p>
    thick. The hall was the noblest I had ever seen; it had a stone and
   </p>
   <p>
    bronze fireplace some twenty or thirty feet long on one side, and
   </p>
   <p>
    several tall arched doorways on the other. The spaces between the doors
   </p>
   <p>
    were covered with sculpture, its material being a blue-gray stone
   </p>
   <p>
    combined or inlaid with a yellow metal, the effect being indescribably
   </p>
   <p>
    rich. The floor was mosaic of many dark colors, but with no definite
   </p>
   <p>
    pattern, and the concave roof was deep red in color. Though beautiful,
   </p>
   <p>
    it was somewhat somber, as the light was not strong. At all events, that
   </p>
   <p>
    is how it struck me at first on coming in from the bright sunlight. Nor,
   </p>
   <p>
    it appeared, was I alone in experiencing such a feeling. As soon as we
   </p>
   <p>
    were inside, the old gentleman, removing his cap and passing his thin
   </p>
   <p>
    fingers through his white hair, looked around him, and addressing some
   </p>
   <p>
    of the others, who were bringing in small round tables and placing them
   </p>
   <p>
    about the hall, said: "No, no; let us sup this evening where we can look
   </p>
   <p>
    at the sky."
   </p>
   <p>
    The tables were immediately taken away.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now some of those who were in the hall or who came in with the tables
   </p>
   <p>
    had not attended the funeral, and these were all astonished on seeing
   </p>
   <p>
    me. They did not stare at me, but I, of course, saw the expression on
   </p>
   <p>
    their faces, and noticed that the others who had made my acquaintance at
   </p>
   <p>
    the grave-side whispered in their ears to explain my presence. This made
   </p>
   <p>
    me extremely uncomfortable, and it was a relief when they began to go
   </p>
   <p>
    out again.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the men was seated near me; he was of those who had assisted in
   </p>
   <p>
    carrying the corpse, and he now turned to me and remarked: "You have
   </p>
   <p>
    been a long time in the open air, and probably feel the change as much
   </p>
   <p>
    as we do."
   </p>
   <p>
    I assented, and he rose and walked away to the far end of the hall,
   </p>
   <p>
    where a great door stood facing the one by which we had entered. From
   </p>
   <p>
    the spot where I was--a distance of forty or fifty feet, perhaps--this
   </p>
   <p>
    door appeared to be of polished slate of a very dark gray, its surface
   </p>
   <p>
    ornamented with very large horse-chestnut leaves of brass or copper, or
   </p>
   <p>
    both, for they varied in shade from bright yellow to deepest copper-red.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a double door with agate handles, and, first pressing on one
   </p>
   <p>
    handle, then on the other, he thrust it back into the walls on either
   </p>
   <p>
    side, revealing a new thing of beauty to my eyes, for behind the
   </p>
   <p>
    vanished door was a window, the sight of which came suddenly before me
   </p>
   <p>
    like a celestial vision. Sunshine, wind, cloud and rain had evidently
   </p>
   <p>
    inspired the artist who designed it, but I did not at the time
   </p>
   <p>
    understand the meaning of the symbolic figures appearing in the picture.
   </p>
   <p>
    Below, with loosened dark golden-red hair and amber-colored garments
   </p>
   <p>
    fluttering in the wind, stood a graceful female figure on the summit of
   </p>
   <p>
    a gray rock; over the rock, and as high as her knees, slanted the thin
   </p>
   <p>
    branches of some mountain shrub, the strong wind even now stripping them
   </p>
   <p>
    of their remaining yellow and russet leaves, whirling them aloft and
   </p>
   <p>
    away. Round the woman's head was a garland of ivy leaves, and she was
   </p>
   <p>
    gazing aloft with expectant face, stretching up her arms, as if to
   </p>
   <p>
    implore or receive some precious gift from the sky. Above, against the
   </p>
   <p>
    slaty-gray cloud-wrack, four exquisite slender girl-forms appeared, with
   </p>
   <p>
    loose hair, silver-gray drapery and gauzy wings as of ephemerae, flying
   </p>
   <p>
    in pursuit of the cloud. Each carried a quantity of flowers, shaped like
   </p>
   <p>
    lilies, in her dress, held up with the left hand; one carried red
   </p>
   <p>
    lilies, another yellow, the third violet, and the last blue; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    gauzy wings and drapery of each was also touched in places with the same
   </p>
   <p>
    hue as the flowers she carried. Looking back in their flight they were
   </p>
   <p>
    all with the disengaged hand throwing down lilies to the standing
   </p>
   <p>
    figure.
   </p>
   <p>
    This lovely window gave a fresh charm to the whole apartment, while the
   </p>
   <p>
    sunlight falling through it served also to reveal other beauties which I
   </p>
   <p>
    had not observed. One that quickly drew and absorbed my attention was a
   </p>
   <p>
    piece of statuary on the floor at some distance from me, and going to it
   </p>
   <p>
    I stood for some time gazing on it in the greatest delight. It was a
   </p>
   <p>
    statue about one-third the size of life, of a young woman seated on a
   </p>
   <p>
    white bull with golden horns. She had a graceful figure and beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    countenance; the face, arms and feet were alabaster, the flesh tinted,
   </p>
   <p>
    but with colors more delicate than in nature. On her arms were broad
   </p>
   <p>
    golden armlets, and the drapery, a long flowing robe, was blue,
   </p>
   <p>
    embroidered with yellow flowers. A stringed instrument rested on her
   </p>
   <p>
    knee, and she was represented playing and singing. The bull, with
   </p>
   <p>
    lowered horns, appeared walking; about his chest hung a garland of
   </p>
   <p>
    flowers mingled with ears of yellow corn, oak, ivy, and various other
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves, green and russet, and acorns and crimson berries. The garland
   </p>
   <p>
    and blue dress were made of malachite, lapis lazuli, and various
   </p>
   <p>
    precious stones.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Aha, my fair Phoenician, I know you well!" thought I exultingly,
   </p>
   <p>
    "though I never saw you before with a harp in your hand. But were you
   </p>
   <p>
    not gathering flowers, O lovely daughter of Agenor, when that celestial
   </p>
   <p>
    animal, that masquerading god, put himself so cunningly in your way to
   </p>
   <p>
    be admired and caressed, until you unsuspiciously placed yourself on his
   </p>
   <p>
    back? That explains the garland. I shall have a word to say about this
   </p>
   <p>
    pretty thing to my learned and very superior host."
   </p>
   <p>
    The statue stood on an octagonal pedestal of a highly polished
   </p>
   <p>
    slaty-gray stone, and on each of its eight faces was a picture in which
   </p>
   <p>
    one human figure appeared. Now, from gazing on the statue itself I fell
   </p>
   <p>
    to contemplating one of these pictures with a very keen interest, for
   </p>
   <p>
    the figure, I recognized, was a portrait of the beautiful girl Yoletta.
   </p>
   <p>
    The picture was a winter landscape. The earth was white, not with snow,
   </p>
   <p>
    but with hoar frost; the distant trees, clothed by the frozen moisture
   </p>
   <p>
    as if with a feathery foliage, looked misty against the whitey-blue
   </p>
   <p>
    wintry sky. In the foreground, on the pale frosted grass, stood the
   </p>
   <p>
    girl, in a dark maroon dress, with silver embroidery on the bosom, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    dark red cap on her head. Close to her drooped the slender terminal
   </p>
   <p>
    twigs of a tree, sparkling with rime and icicle, and on the twigs were
   </p>
   <p>
    several small snow-white birds, hopping and fluttering down towards her
   </p>
   <p>
    outstretched hand; while she gazed up at them with flushed cheeks, and
   </p>
   <p>
    lips parting with a bright, joyous smile.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently, while I stood admiring this most lovely work, the young man I
   </p>
   <p>
    have mentioned as having raised Yoletta from the ground at the grave
   </p>
   <p>
    came to my side and remarked, smiling: "You have noticed the
   </p>
   <p>
    resemblance."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, indeed," I returned; "she is painted to the life."
   </p>
   <p>
    "This is not Yoletta's portrait," he replied, "though it is very like
   </p>
   <p>
    her;" and then, when I looked at him incredulously, he pointed to some
   </p>
   <p>
    letters under the picture, saying: "Do you not see the name and date?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Finding that I could not read the words, I hazarded the remark that it
   </p>
   <p>
    was Yoletta's mother, perhaps.
   </p>
   <p>
    "This portrait was painted four centuries ago," he said, with surprise
   </p>
   <p>
    in his accent; and then he turned aside, thinking me, perhaps, a rather
   </p>
   <p>
    dull and ignorant person.
   </p>
   <p>
    I did not want him to go away with that impression, and remarked,
   </p>
   <p>
    pointing to the statue I have spoken of: "I fancy I know very well who
   </p>
   <p>
    that is--that is Europa."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Europa? That is a name I never heard; I doubt that any one in the house
   </p>
   <p>
    ever bore it." Then, with a half-puzzled smile, he added: "How could you
   </p>
   <p>
    possibly know unless you were told? No, that is Mistrelde. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    formerly the custom of the house for the Mother to ride on a white bull
   </p>
   <p>
    at the harvest festival. Mistrelde was the last to observe it."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, I see," I returned lamely, though I didn't see at all. The
   </p>
   <p>
    indifferent way in which he spoke of centuries in connection with
   </p>
   <p>
    this brilliant and apparently fresh-painted picture rather took me
   </p>
   <p>
    aback.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently he condescended to say something more. Pointing to the marks
   </p>
   <p>
    or characters which I could not read, he said: "You have seen the name
   </p>
   <p>
    of Yoletta here, and that and the resemblance misled you. You must know
   </p>
   <p>
    that there has always been a Yoletta in this house. This was the
   </p>
   <p>
    daughter of Mistrelde, the Mother, who died young and left but eight
   </p>
   <p>
    children; and when this work was made their portraits were placed on the
   </p>
   <p>
    eight faces of the pedestal."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Thanks for telling me," I said, wondering if it was all true, or only a
   </p>
   <p>
    fantastic romance.
   </p>
   <p>
    He then motioned me to follow him, and we quitted that room where it had
   </p>
   <p>
    been decided that we were not to sup.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 4
   </p>
   <p>
    We came to a large portico-like place open on three sides to the air,
   </p>
   <p>
    the roof being supported by slender columns. We were now on the opposite
   </p>
   <p>
    side of the house and looked upon the river, which was not more than a
   </p>
   <p>
    couple of hundred yards from the terrace or platform on which it stood.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ground here sloped rapidly to the banks, and, like that in the
   </p>
   <p>
    front, was a wilderness with rock and patches of tall fern and thickets
   </p>
   <p>
    of thorn and bramble, with a few trees of great size. Nor was wild life
   </p>
   <p>
    wanting in this natural park; some deer were feeding near the bank,
   </p>
   <p>
    while on the water numbers of wild duck and other water-fowl were
   </p>
   <p>
    disporting themselves, splashing and flapping over the surface and
   </p>
   <p>
    uttering shrill cries.
   </p>
   <p>
    The people of the house were already assembled, standing and sitting by
   </p>
   <p>
    the small tables. There was a lively hum of conversation, which ceased
   </p>
   <p>
    on my entrance; then those who were sitting stood up and the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    company fixed its eyes on me, which was rather disconcerting.
   </p>
   <p>
    The old gentleman, standing in the midst of the people, now bent on me a
   </p>
   <p>
    long, scrutinizing gaze; he appeared to be waiting for me to speak, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    finding that I remained silent, he finally addressed me with solemnity.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Smith," he said--and I did not like it--"the meeting with you today was
   </p>
   <p>
    to me and to all of us a very strange experience: I little thought that
   </p>
   <p>
    an even stranger one awaited me, that before you break bread in this
   </p>
   <p>
    house in which you have found shelter, I should have to remind you that
   </p>
   <p>
    you are now in a house."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, I know I am," I said, and then added: "I'm sure, sir, I appreciate
   </p>
   <p>
    your kindness in bringing me here."
   </p>
   <p>
    He had perhaps expected something more or something entirely different
   </p>
   <p>
    from me, as he continued standing with his eyes fixed on me. Then with a
   </p>
   <p>
    sigh, and looking round him, he said in a dissatisfied tone: "My
   </p>
   <p>
    children, let us begin, and for the present put out of our minds this
   </p>
   <p>
    matter which has been troubling us."
   </p>
   <p>
    He then motioned me to a seat at his own table, where I was pleased to
   </p>
   <p>
    have a place since the lovely Yoletta was also there.
   </p>
   <p>
    I am not particular about what I eat, as with me good digestion waits on
   </p>
   <p>
    appetite, and so long as I get a bellyful--to use a good old English
   </p>
   <p>
    word--I am satisfied. On this particular occasion, with or without a
   </p>
   <p>
    pretty girl at the table, I could have consumed a haggis--that greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    abomination ever invented by flesh-eating barbarians--I was so
   </p>
   <p>
    desperately hungry. It was therefore a disappointment when nothing more
   </p>
   <p>
    substantial than a plate of whitey-green, crisp-looking stuff resembling
   </p>
   <p>
    endive, was placed before me by one of the picturesque handmaidens. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was cold and somewhat bitter to the taste, but hunger compelled me to
   </p>
   <p>
    eat it even to the last green leaf; then, when I began to wonder if it
   </p>
   <p>
    would be right to ask for more, to my great relief other more succulent
   </p>
   <p>
    dishes followed, composed of various vegetables. We also had some
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant drinks, made, I suppose, from the juices of fruits, but the
   </p>
   <p>
    delicious alcoholic sting was not in them. We had fruits, too, of
   </p>
   <p>
    unfamiliar flavors, and a confection of crushed nuts and honey.
   </p>
   <p>
    We sat at table--or tables--a long time, and the meal was enlivened with
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation; for all now appeared in a cheerful frame of mind,
   </p>
   <p>
    notwithstanding the melancholy event which had occupied them during the
   </p>
   <p>
    day. It was, in fact, a kind of supper, and the one great meal of the
   </p>
   <p>
    day: the only other meals being a breakfast, and at noon a crust of
   </p>
   <p>
    brown bread, a handful of dried fruit, and drink of milk.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the conclusion of the repast, during which I had been too much
   </p>
   <p>
    occupied to take notice of everything that passed, I observed that a
   </p>
   <p>
    number of small birds had flown in, and were briskly hopping over the
   </p>
   <p>
    floor and tables, also perching quite fearlessly on the heads or
   </p>
   <p>
    shoulders of the company, and that they were being fed with the
   </p>
   <p>
    fragments. I took them to be sparrows and things of that kind, but they
   </p>
   <p>
    did not look altogether familiar to me. One little fellow, most lively
   </p>
   <p>
    in his motions, was remarkably like my old friend the robin, only the
   </p>
   <p>
    bosom was more vivid, running almost into orange, and the wings and tail
   </p>
   <p>
    were tipped with the same hue, giving it quite a distinguished
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance. Another small olive-green bird, which I at first took for a
   </p>
   <p>
    green linnet, was even prettier, the throat and bosom being of a most
   </p>
   <p>
    delicate buff, crossed with a belt of velvet black. The bird that really
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed most like a common sparrow was chestnut, with a white throat and
   </p>
   <p>
    mouse-colored wings and tail. These pretty little pensioners
   </p>
   <p>
    systematically avoided my neighborhood, although I tempted them with
   </p>
   <p>
    crumbs and fruit; only one flew onto my table, but had no sooner done so
   </p>
   <p>
    than it darted away again, and out of the room, as if greatly alarmed. I
   </p>
   <p>
    caught the pretty girl's eye just then, and having finished eating, and
   </p>
   <p>
    being anxious to join the conversation, for I hate to sit silent when
   </p>
   <p>
    others are talking. I remarked that it was strange the little birds so
   </p>
   <p>
    persistently avoided me.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh no, not at all strange," she replied, with surprising readiness,
   </p>
   <p>
    showing that she too had noticed it. "They are frightened at your
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I must indeed appear strange to them," said I, with some bitterness,
   </p>
   <p>
    and recalling the adventures of the morning. "It is to me a new and very
   </p>
   <p>
    painful experience to walk about the world frightening men, cattle, and
   </p>
   <p>
    birds; yet I suppose it is entirely due to the clothes I am wearing--and
   </p>
   <p>
    the boots. I wish some kind person would suggest a remedy for this state
   </p>
   <p>
    of things; for just now my greatest desire is to be dressed in
   </p>
   <p>
    accordance with the fashion."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Allow me to interrupt you for one moment, Smith," said the old
   </p>
   <p>
    gentleman, who had been listening attentively to my words. "We
   </p>
   <p>
    understood what you said so well on this occasion that it seems a pity
   </p>
   <p>
    you should suddenly again render yourself unintelligible. Can you
   </p>
   <p>
    explain to us what you mean by dressing in accordance with the fashion?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "My meaning is, that I simply desire to dress like one of yourselves, to
   </p>
   <p>
    see the last of these uncouth garments." I could not help putting
   </p>
   <p>
    a little vicious emphasis on that hateful word.
   </p>
   <p>
    He inclined his head and said, "Yes?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus encouraged, I dashed boldly into the middle of matter; for now,
   </p>
   <p>
    having dined, albeit without wine, I was inflamed with an intense
   </p>
   <p>
    craving to see myself arrayed in their rich, mysterious dress. "This
   </p>
   <p>
    being so," I continued, "may I ask you if it is in your power to provide
   </p>
   <p>
    me with the necessary garments, so that I may cease to be an object of
   </p>
   <p>
    aversion and offense to every living thing and person, myself included?"
   </p>
   <p>
    A long and uncomfortable silence ensued, which was perhaps not strange,
   </p>
   <p>
    considering the nature of the request. That I had blundered once more
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed likely enough, from the general suspense and the somewhat alarmed
   </p>
   <p>
    expression of the old gentleman's countenance; nevertheless, my motives
   </p>
   <p>
    had been good: I had expressed my wish in that way for the sake of peace
   </p>
   <p>
    and quietness, and fearing that if I had asked to be directed to the
   </p>
   <p>
    nearest clothing establishment, a new fit of amazement would have been
   </p>
   <p>
    the result.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finding the silence intolerable, I at length ventured to remark that I
   </p>
   <p>
    feared he had not understood me to the end.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Perhaps not," he answered gravely. "Or, rather let me say, I hope not."
   </p>
   <p>
    "May I explain my meaning?" said I, greatly distressed.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Assuredly you may," he replied with dignity. "Only before you speak,
   </p>
   <p>
    let me put this plain question to you: Do you ask us to provide you with
   </p>
   <p>
    garments--that is to say, to bestow them as a gift on you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Certainly not!" I exclaimed, turning crimson with shame to think that
   </p>
   <p>
    they were all taking me for a beggar. "My wish is to obtain them somehow
   </p>
   <p>
    from somebody, since I cannot make them for myself, and to give in
   </p>
   <p>
    return their full value."
   </p>
   <p>
    I had no sooner spoken than I greatly feared that I had made matters
   </p>
   <p>
    worse; for here was I, a guest in the house, actually offering to
   </p>
   <p>
    purchase clothing--ready-made or to to order--from my host, who, for all
   </p>
   <p>
    I knew, might be one of the aristocracy of the country. My fears,
   </p>
   <p>
    however, proved quite groundless.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am glad to hear your explanation," he answered, "for it has
   </p>
   <p>
    completely removed the unpleasant impression caused by your former
   </p>
   <p>
    words. What can you do in return for the garments you are anxious to
   </p>
   <p>
    possess? And here, let me remark, I approve highly of your wish to
   </p>
   <p>
    escape, with the least possible delay, from your present covering. Do
   </p>
   <p>
    you wish to confine yourself to the finishing of some work in a
   </p>
   <p>
    particular line--as wood-carving, or stone, metal, clay or glass work;
   </p>
   <p>
    or in making or using colors? or have you only that general knowledge of
   </p>
   <p>
    the various arts which would enable you to assist the more skilled in
   </p>
   <p>
    preparing materials?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, I am not an artist," I replied, surprised at his question. "All I
   </p>
   <p>
    can do is to buy the clothes--to pay for them in money."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What do you mean by that? What is money?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Surely----" I began, but fortunately checked myself in time, for I had
   </p>
   <p>
    meant to suggest that he was pulling my leg. But it was really hard to
   </p>
   <p>
    believe that a person of his years did not know what money was. Besides,
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not answer the question, having always abhorred the study of
   </p>
   <p>
    political economy, which tells you all about it; so that I had never
   </p>
   <p>
    learned to define money, but only how to spend it. Presently I thought
   </p>
   <p>
    the best way out of the muddle was to show him some, and I accordingly
   </p>
   <p>
    pulled out my big leather book-purse from my breast pocket. It had an
   </p>
   <p>
    ancient, musty smell, like everything else about me, but seemed pretty
   </p>
   <p>
    heavy and well-filled, and I proceeded to open it and turn the contents
   </p>
   <p>
    on the table. Eleven bright sovereigns and three half-crowns or florins,
   </p>
   <p>
    I forget which, rolled out; then, unfolding the papers, I discovered
   </p>
   <p>
    three five-pound Bank of England notes.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Surely this is very little for me to have about me!" said I, feeling
   </p>
   <p>
    greatly disappointed. "I fancy I must have been making ducks and drakes
   </p>
   <p>
    of a lot of cash before--before--well, before I was--I don't know what,
   </p>
   <p>
    or when, or where."
   </p>
   <p>
    Little notice was taken of this somewhat incoherent speech, for all were
   </p>
   <p>
    now gathering round the table, examining the gold and notes with eager
   </p>
   <p>
    curiosity. At length the old gentleman, pointing to the gold pieces,
   </p>
   <p>
    said: "What are these?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Sovereigns," I answered, not a little amused. "Have you never seen any
   </p>
   <p>
    like them before?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Never. Let me examine them again. Yes, these eleven are of gold. They
   </p>
   <p>
    are all marked alike, on one side with a roughly-executed figure of a
   </p>
   <p>
    woman's head, with the hair gathered on its summit in a kind of ball.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are also other things on them which I do not understand."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Can you not read the letters?" I asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No. The letters--if these marks are letters--are incomprehensible to
   </p>
   <p>
    me. But what have these small pieces of metal to do with the question of
   </p>
   <p>
    your garments? You puzzle me."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, everything. These pieces of metal, as you call them, are money,
   </p>
   <p>
    and represent, of course, so much buying power. I don't know yet what
   </p>
   <p>
    your currency is, and whether you have the dollar or the rupee"--here I
   </p>
   <p>
    paused, seeing that he did not follow me. "My idea is this," I resumed,
   </p>
   <p>
    and coming down to very plain speaking: "I can give one of these
   </p>
   <p>
    five-pound notes, or its equivalent in gold, if you prefer that--five of
   </p>
   <p>
    these sovereigns, I mean--for a suit of clothes such as you all wear."
   </p>
   <p>
    So great was my desire to possess the clothes that I was about to double
   </p>
   <p>
    the offer, which struck me as poor, and add that I would give ten
   </p>
   <p>
    sovereigns; but when I had spoken he dropped the piece he held in his
   </p>
   <p>
    hand upon the table, and stared fixedly at me, assisted by all the
   </p>
   <p>
    others. Presently, in the profound silence which ensued, a low, silvery
   </p>
   <p>
    gurgling became audible, as of some merry mountain burn--a sweet,
   </p>
   <p>
    warbling sound, swelling louder by degrees until it ended in a long
   </p>
   <p>
    ringing peal of laughter.
   </p>
   <p>
    This was from the girl Yoletta. I stared at her, surprised at her
   </p>
   <p>
    unseasonable levity; but the only effect of my doing so was a general
   </p>
   <p>
    explosion, men and women joining in such a tempest of merriment that one
   </p>
   <p>
    might have imagined they had just heard the most wonderful joke ever
   </p>
   <p>
    invented since man acquired the sense of the ludicrous.
   </p>
   <p>
    The old gentleman was the first to recover a decent gravity, although it
   </p>
   <p>
    was plain to see that he struggled severely at intervals to prevent a
   </p>
   <p>
    relapse.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Smith," said he, "of all the extraordinary delusions you appear to be
   </p>
   <p>
    suffering from, this, that you can have garments to wear in return for a
   </p>
   <p>
    small piece of paper, or for a few bits of this metal, is the most
   </p>
   <p>
    astounding! You cannot exchange these trifles for clothes, because
   </p>
   <p>
    clothes are the fruit of much labor of many hands."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And yet, sir, you said you understood me when I proposed to pay for the
   </p>
   <p>
    things I require," said I, in an aggrieved tone. "You seemed even to
   </p>
   <p>
    approve of the offer I made. How, then, am I to pay for them if all I
   </p>
   <p>
    possess is not considered of any value?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "All you possess!" he replied. "Surely I did not say that! Surely
   </p>
   <p>
    you possess the strength and skill common to all men, and can acquire
   </p>
   <p>
    anything you wish by the labor of your hands."
   </p>
   <p>
    I began once more to see light, although my skill, I knew, would not
   </p>
   <p>
    count for much. "Ah yes," I answered: "to go back to that subject, I do
   </p>
   <p>
    not know anything about wood-carving or using colors, but I might be
   </p>
   <p>
    able to do something--some work of a simpler kind."
   </p>
   <p>
    "There are trees to be felled, land to be plowed, and many other things
   </p>
   <p>
    to be done. If you will do these things some one else will be released
   </p>
   <p>
    to perform works of skill; and as these are the most agreeable to the
   </p>
   <p>
    worker, it would please us more to have you labor in the fields than in
   </p>
   <p>
    the workhouse."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am strong," I answered, "and will gladly undertake labor of the kind
   </p>
   <p>
    you speak of. There is, however, one difficulty. My desire is to change
   </p>
   <p>
    these clothes for others which will be more pleasing to the eye, at
   </p>
   <p>
    once; but the work I shall have to do in return will not be finished in
   </p>
   <p>
    a day. Perhaps not in--well, several days."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, of course not," said he. "A year's labor will be necessary to pay
   </p>
   <p>
    for the garments you require."
   </p>
   <p>
    This staggered me; for if the clothes were given to me at the beginning,
   </p>
   <p>
    then before the end of the year they would be worn to rags, and I should
   </p>
   <p>
    make myself a slave for life. I was sorely perplexed in mind, and pulled
   </p>
   <p>
    about this way and that by the fear of incurring a debt, and the desire
   </p>
   <p>
    to see myself (and to be seen by Yoletta) in those strangely fascinating
   </p>
   <p>
    garments. That I had a decent figure, and was not a bad-looking young
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow, I was pretty sure; and the hope that I should be able to create
   </p>
   <p>
    an impression (favorable, I mean) on the heart of that supremely
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful girl was very strong in me. At all events, by closing with the
   </p>
   <p>
    offer I should have a year of happiness in her society, and a year of
   </p>
   <p>
    healthy work in the fields could not hurt me, or interfere much with my
   </p>
   <p>
    prospects. Besides, I was not quite sure that my prospects were really
   </p>
   <p>
    worth thinking about just now. Certainly, I had always lived
   </p>
   <p>
    comfortably, spending money, eating and drinking of the best, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dressing well--that is, according to the London standard. And there was
   </p>
   <p>
    my dear old bachelor Uncle Jack--John Smith, Member of Parliament for
   </p>
   <p>
    Wormwood Scrubbs. That is to say, ex-Member; for, being a Liberal when
   </p>
   <p>
    the great change came at the last general election, he was ignominiously
   </p>
   <p>
    ousted from his seat, the Scrubbs proving at the finish a bitter place
   </p>
   <p>
    to him. He was put out in more ways than one, and tried to comfort
   </p>
   <p>
    himself by saying that there would soon be another dissolution--thinking
   </p>
   <p>
    of his own, possibly, being an old man. I remembered that I had rather
   </p>
   <p>
    looked forward to such a contingency, thinking how pleasant it would be
   </p>
   <p>
    to have all that money, and cruise about the world in my own yacht,
   </p>
   <p>
    enjoying myself as I knew how. And really I had some reason to hope. I
   </p>
   <p>
    remember he used to wind up the talk of an evening when I dined with him
   </p>
   <p>
    (and got a check) by saying: "My boy, you have talents, if you'd only
   </p>
   <p>
    use 'em." Where were those talents now? Certainly they had not made me
   </p>
   <p>
    shine much during the last few hours.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, all this seemed unsubstantial, and I remembered these things dimly,
   </p>
   <p>
    like a dream or a story told to me in childhood; and sometimes, when
   </p>
   <p>
    recalling the past, I seemed to be thinking about ancient
   </p>
   <p>
    history--Sesostris, and the Babylonians and Assyrians, and that sort of
   </p>
   <p>
    thing. And, besides, it would be very hard to get back from a place
   </p>
   <p>
    where even the name of London was unknown. And perhaps, if I ever should
   </p>
   <p>
    succeed in getting back, it would only be to encounter a second Roger
   </p>
   <p>
    Tichborne case, or to be confronted with the statute of limitations.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyhow, a year could not make much difference, and I should also keep my
   </p>
   <p>
    money, which seemed an advantage, though it wasn't much. I looked up:
   </p>
   <p>
    they were all once more studying the coins and notes, and exchanging
   </p>
   <p>
    remarks about them.
   </p>
   <p>
    "If I bind myself to work one year," said I, "shall I have to wait until
   </p>
   <p>
    the end of that time before I get the clothes?"
   </p>
   <p>
    The reply to this question, I thought, would settle the matter one way
   </p>
   <p>
    or the other.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No," said he. "It is your wish, and also ours, that you should be
   </p>
   <p>
    differently clothed at once, and the garments you require would be made
   </p>
   <p>
    for you immediately."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Then," said I, taking the desperate plunge, "I should like to have them
   </p>
   <p>
    as soon as possible, and I am ready to commence work at once."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You shall commence to-morrow morning," he answered, smiling at my
   </p>
   <p>
    impetuosity. "The daughters of the house, whose province it is to make
   </p>
   <p>
    these things, shall also suspend other work until your garments are
   </p>
   <p>
    finished. And now, my son, from this evening you are one of the house
   </p>
   <p>
    and one of us, and the things which we possess you also possess in
   </p>
   <p>
    common with us."
   </p>
   <p>
    I rose and thanked him. He too rose, and, after looking round on us with
   </p>
   <p>
    a fatherly smile, went away to the interior of the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 5
   </p>
   <p>
    When he was gone, and Yoletta had followed, leaving some of the others
   </p>
   <p>
    still studying those wretched sovereigns, I sat down again and rested my
   </p>
   <p>
    chin on my hand; for I was now thinking--deeply: thinking on the terms
   </p>
   <p>
    of the agreement. "I daresay I have succeeded in making a precious ass
   </p>
   <p>
    of myself," was the mental reflection that occurred to me--one I had not
   </p>
   <p>
    infrequently made, and, what is more, been justified in making on former
   </p>
   <p>
    occasions. Then, remembering that I had come to supper with an
   </p>
   <p>
    extravagant appetite, it struck me that my host, quietly observant, had,
   </p>
   <p>
    when proposing terms, taken into account the quantity of food necessary
   </p>
   <p>
    for my sustenance. I regretted too late that I had not exercised more
   </p>
   <p>
    restraint; but the hungry man does not and cannot consider consequences,
   </p>
   <p>
    else a certain hairy gentleman who figures in ancient history had never
   </p>
   <p>
    lent himself to that nefarious compact, which gave so great an advantage
   </p>
   <p>
    to a younger but sleek and well-nourished brother. In spite of all this,
   </p>
   <p>
    I felt a secret satisfaction in the thought of the clothes, and it was
   </p>
   <p>
    also good to know that the nature of the work I had undertaken would not
   </p>
   <p>
    lower my status in the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    Occupied with these reflections, I had failed to observe that the
   </p>
   <p>
    company had gradually been drifting away until but one person was left
   </p>
   <p>
    with me--the young man who had talked with me before. On his invitation
   </p>
   <p>
    I now rose, put by my money, and followed him. Returning by the hall we
   </p>
   <p>
    went through a passage and entered a room of vast extent, which in its
   </p>
   <p>
    form and great length and high arched roof was like the nave of a
   </p>
   <p>
    cathedral. And yet how unlike in that something ethereal in its aspect,
   </p>
   <p>
    as of a nave in a cloud cathedral, its far-stretching shining floors and
   </p>
   <p>
    walls and columns, pure white and pearl-gray, faintly touched with
   </p>
   <p>
    colors of exquisite delicacy. And over it all was the roof of white or
   </p>
   <p>
    pale gray glass tinged with golden-red--the roof which I had seen from
   </p>
   <p>
    the outside when it seemed to me like a cloud resting on the stony
   </p>
   <p>
    summit of a hill.
   </p>
   <p>
    On coming in I had the impression of an empty, silent place; yet the
   </p>
   <p>
    inmates of the house were all there; they were sitting and reclining on
   </p>
   <p>
    low couches, some lying at their ease on straw mats on the floor; some
   </p>
   <p>
    were reading, others were occupied with some work in their hands, and
   </p>
   <p>
    some were conversing, the sound coming to me like a faint murmur from a
   </p>
   <p>
    distance.
   </p>
   <p>
    At one side, somewhere about the center of the room, there was a broad
   </p>
   <p>
    raised place, or dais, with a couch on it, on which the father was
   </p>
   <p>
    reclining at his ease. Beside the couch stood a lectern on which a large
   </p>
   <p>
    volume rested, and before him there was a brass box or cabinet, and
   </p>
   <p>
    behind the couch seven polished brass globes were ranged, suspended on
   </p>
   <p>
    axles resting on bronze frames. These globes varied in size, the largest
   </p>
   <p>
    being not less than about twelve feet in circumference.
   </p>
   <p>
    I noticed that there were books on a low stand near me. They were all
   </p>
   <p>
    folios, very much alike in form and thickness; and seeing presently that
   </p>
   <p>
    the others were all following their own inclinations, and considering
   </p>
   <p>
    that I had been left to my own resources and that it is a good plan when
   </p>
   <p>
    at Rome to do as the Romans do, I by-and-by ventured to help myself to a
   </p>
   <p>
    volume, which I carried to one of the reading-stands.
   </p>
   <p>
    Books are grand things--sometimes, thought I, prepared to follow the
   </p>
   <p>
    advice I had received, and find out by reading all about the customs of
   </p>
   <p>
    this people, especially their ideas concerning The House, which
   </p>
   <p>
    appeared to be an object of almost religious regard with them. This
   </p>
   <p>
    would make me quite independent, and teach me how to avoid blundering in
   </p>
   <p>
    the future, or giving expression to any more "extraordinary delusions."
   </p>
   <p>
    On opening the volume I was greatly surprised to find that it was richly
   </p>
   <p>
    illuminated on every leaf, the middle only of each page being occupied
   </p>
   <p>
    with a rather narrow strip of writing; but the minute letters,
   </p>
   <p>
    resembling Hebrew characters, were incomprehensible to me. I bore the
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointment very cheerfully, I must say, for I am not over-fond of
   </p>
   <p>
    study; and, besides, I could not have paid proper attention to the text,
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounded with all that distracting beauty of graceful design and
   </p>
   <p>
    brilliant coloring.
   </p>
   <p>
    After a while Yoletta came slowly across the room, her fingers engaged
   </p>
   <p>
    with some kind of wool-work as she walked, and my heart beat fast when
   </p>
   <p>
    she paused by my side.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You are not reading," she said, looking curiously at me. "I have been
   </p>
   <p>
    watching you for some time."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Have you indeed?" said I, not knowing whether to feel flattered or not.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, unfortunately, I can't read this book, as I do not understand the
   </p>
   <p>
    letters. But what a wonderfully beautiful book it is! I was just
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking what some of the great London book-buyers--Quaritch, for
   </p>
   <p>
    instance--would be tempted to give for it. Oh, I am forgetting--you have
   </p>
   <p>
    never heard his name, of course; but--but what a beautiful book it is!"
   </p>
   <p>
    She said nothing in reply, and only looked a little
   </p>
   <p>
    surprised--disgusted, I feared--at my ignorance, then walked away. I had
   </p>
   <p>
    hoped that she was going to talk to me, and with keen disappointment
   </p>
   <p>
    watched her moving across the floor. All the glory seemed now to have
   </p>
   <p>
    gone out of the leaves of the volume, and I continued turning them over
   </p>
   <p>
    listlessly, glancing at intervals at the beautiful girl, who was also
   </p>
   <p>
    like one of the pages before me, wonderful to look at and hard to
   </p>
   <p>
    understand. In a distant part of the room I saw her place some cushions
   </p>
   <p>
    on the floor, and settle herself on them to do her work.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sun had set by this time, and the interior was growing darker by
   </p>
   <p>
    degrees; the fading light, however, seemed to make no difference to
   </p>
   <p>
    those who worked or read. They appeared to be gifted with an owlish
   </p>
   <p>
    vision, able to see with very little light. The father alone did
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing, but still rested on his couch, perhaps indulging in a
   </p>
   <p>
    postprandial nap. At length he roused himself and looked around him.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There is no melody in our hearts this evening, my children," he said.
   </p>
   <p>
    "When another day has passed over us it will perhaps be different.
   </p>
   <p>
    To-night the voice so recently stilled in death forever would be too
   </p>
   <p>
    painfully missed by all of us."
   </p>
   <p>
    Some one then rose and brought a tall wax taper and placed it near him.
   </p>
   <p>
    The flame threw a little brightness on the volume, which he now
   </p>
   <p>
    proceeded to open; and here and there, further away, it flashed and
   </p>
   <p>
    trembled in points of rainbow-colored light on a tall column; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    greater part of the room still remained in twilight obscurity.
   </p>
   <p>
    He began to read aloud, and, although he did not seem to raise his voice
   </p>
   <p>
    above its usual pitch, the words he uttered fell on my ears with a
   </p>
   <p>
    distinctness and purity of sound which made them seem like a melody
   </p>
   <p>
    "sweetly played in tune." The words he read related to life and death,
   </p>
   <p>
    and such solemn matters; but to my mind his theology seemed somewhat
   </p>
   <p>
    fantastical, although it is right to confess that I am no judge of such
   </p>
   <p>
    matters. There was also a great deal about the house, which did
   </p>
   <p>
    not enlighten me much, being too rhapsodical, and when he spoke about
   </p>
   <p>
    our conduct and aims in life, and things of that kind, I understood him
   </p>
   <p>
    little better. Here is a part of his discourse:--
   </p>
   <p>
    "It is natural to grieve for those that die, because light and knowledge
   </p>
   <p>
    and love and joy are no longer theirs; but they grieve not any more,
   </p>
   <p>
    being now asleep on the lap of the Universal Mother, the bride of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Father, who is with us, sharing our sorrow, which was his first; but it
   </p>
   <p>
    dims not his everlasting brightness; and his desire and our glory is
   </p>
   <p>
    that we should always and in all things resemble him.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The end of every day is darkness, but the Father of life through our
   </p>
   <p>
    reason has taught us to mitigate the exceeding bitterness of our end;
   </p>
   <p>
    otherwise, we that are above all other creatures in the earth should
   </p>
   <p>
    have been at the last more miserable than they. For in the irrational
   </p>
   <p>
    world, between the different kinds, there reigns perpetual strife and
   </p>
   <p>
    bloodshed, the strong devouring the weak and the incapable; and when
   </p>
   <p>
    failure of life clouds the brightness of that lower soul, which is
   </p>
   <p>
    theirs, the end is not long delayed. Thus the life that has lasted many
   </p>
   <p>
    days goes out with a brief pang, and in its going gives new vigor to the
   </p>
   <p>
    strong that have yet many days to live. Thus also does the ever-living
   </p>
   <p>
    earth from the dust of dead generations of leaves re-make a fresh
   </p>
   <p>
    foliage, and for herself a new garment.
   </p>
   <p>
    "We only, of all things having life, being like the Father, slay not nor
   </p>
   <p>
    are slain, and are without enemies in the earth; for even the lower
   </p>
   <p>
    kinds, which have not reason, know without reason that we are highest on
   </p>
   <p>
    the earth, and see in us, alone of all his works, the majesty of the
   </p>
   <p>
    Father, and lose all their rage in our presence. Therefore, when the
   </p>
   <p>
    night is near, when life is a burden and we remember our mortality, we
   </p>
   <p>
    hasten the end, that those we love may cease to sorrow at the sight of
   </p>
   <p>
    our decline; and we know that this is his will who called us into being,
   </p>
   <p>
    and gave us life and joy on the earth for a season, but not forever.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It is better to lay down the life that is ours, to leave all
   </p>
   <p>
    things--the love of our kindred; the beauty of the world and of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house; the labor in which we take delight, to go forth and be no more;
   </p>
   <p>
    but the bitterness endures not, and is scarcely tasted when in our last
   </p>
   <p>
    moments we remember that our labor has borne fruit; that the letters we
   </p>
   <p>
    have written perish not with us, but remain as a testimony and a joy to
   </p>
   <p>
    succeeding generations, and live in the house forever.
   </p>
   <p>
    "For the house is the image of the world, and we that live and labor in
   </p>
   <p>
    it are the image of our Father who made the world; and, like him, we
   </p>
   <p>
    labor to make for ourselves a worthy habitation, which shall not shame
   </p>
   <p>
    our teacher. This is his desire; for in all his works, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge which is like pure water to one that thirsts, and satisfies
   </p>
   <p>
    and leaves no taste of bitterness on the palate, we learn the will of
   </p>
   <p>
    him that called us into life. All the knowledge we seek, the invention
   </p>
   <p>
    and skill we possess, and the labor of our hands, has this purpose only:
   </p>
   <p>
    for all knowledge and invention and labor having any other purpose
   </p>
   <p>
    whatsoever is empty and vain in comparison, and unworthy of those that
   </p>
   <p>
    are made in the image of the Father of life. For just as the bodily
   </p>
   <p>
    senses may become perverted, and the taste lose its discrimination, so
   </p>
   <p>
    that the hungry man will devour acrid fruits and poisonous herbs for
   </p>
   <p>
    aliment, so is the mind capable of seeking out new paths, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge which leads only to misery and destruction.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Thus we know that in the past men sought after knowledge of various
   </p>
   <p>
    kinds, asking not whether it was for good or for evil: but every offense
   </p>
   <p>
    of the mind and the body has its appropriate reward; and while their
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge grew apace, that better knowledge and discrimination which the
   </p>
   <p>
    Father gives to every living soul, both in man and in beast, was taken
   </p>
   <p>
    from them. Thus by increasing their riches they were made poorer; and,
   </p>
   <p>
    like one who, forgetting the limits that are set to his faculties, gazes
   </p>
   <p>
    steadfastly on the sun, by seeing much they become afflicted with
   </p>
   <p>
    blindness. But they know not their poverty and blindness, and were not
   </p>
   <p>
    satisfied; but were like shipwrecked men on a lonely and barren rock in
   </p>
   <p>
    the midst of the sea, who are consumed with thirst, and drink of no
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet spring, but of the bitter wave, and thirst, and drink again, until
   </p>
   <p>
    madness possesses their brains, and death releases them from their
   </p>
   <p>
    misery. Thus did they thirst, and drink again, and were crazed; being
   </p>
   <p>
    inflamed with the desire to learn the secrets of nature, hesitating not
   </p>
   <p>
    to dip their hands in blood, seeking in the living tissues of animals
   </p>
   <p>
    for the hidden springs of life. For in their madness they hoped by
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge to gain absolute dominion over nature, thereby taking from the
   </p>
   <p>
    Father of the world his prerogative.
   </p>
   <p>
    "But their vain ambition lasted not, and the end of it was death. The
   </p>
   <p>
    madness of their minds preyed on their bodies, and worms were bred in
   </p>
   <p>
    their corrupted flesh: and these, after feeding on their tissues,
   </p>
   <p>
    changed their forms; and becoming winged, flew out in the breath of
   </p>
   <p>
    their nostrils, like clouds of winged ants that issue in the springtime
   </p>
   <p>
    from their breeding-places; and, flying from body to body, filled the
   </p>
   <p>
    race of men in all places with corruption and decay; and the Mother of
   </p>
   <p>
    men was thus avenged of her children for their pride and folly, for they
   </p>
   <p>
    perished miserably, devoured of worms.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Of the human race only a small remnant survived, these being men of an
   </p>
   <p>
    humble mind, who had lived apart and unknown to their fellows; and after
   </p>
   <p>
    long centuries they went forth into the wilderness of earth and
   </p>
   <p>
    repeopled it; but nowhere did they find any trace or record of those
   </p>
   <p>
    that had passed away; for earth had covered all their ruined works with
   </p>
   <p>
    her dark mold and green forests, even as a man hides unsightly scars on
   </p>
   <p>
    his body with a new and beautiful garment. Nor is it known to us when
   </p>
   <p>
    this destruction fell upon the race of men; we only know that the
   </p>
   <p>
    history thereof was graven an hundred centuries ago on the granite
   </p>
   <p>
    pillars of the House of Evor, on the plains between the sea and the
   </p>
   <p>
    snow-covered mountains of Elf. Thither in past ages some of our pilgrims
   </p>
   <p>
    journeyed, and have brought a record of these things; nor in our house
   </p>
   <p>
    only are they known, but in many houses throughout the world have they
   </p>
   <p>
    been written for the instruction of all men and a warning for all time.
   </p>
   <p>
    "But to mankind there shall come no second darkness of error, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    seeking after vain knowledge; and in the Father's House there shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    no second desolation, but the sounds of joy and melody, which were
   </p>
   <p>
    silent, shall be heard everlastingly; since we had now continued long in
   </p>
   <p>
    this even mind, seeking only to inform ourselves of his will; until as
   </p>
   <p>
    in a clear crystal without flaw shining with colored light, or as a
   </p>
   <p>
    glassy lake reflecting within itself the heavens and every cloud and
   </p>
   <p>
    star, so is he reflected in our minds; and in the house we are his
   </p>
   <p>
    viceregents, and in the world his co-workers; and for the glory which he
   </p>
   <p>
    has in his work we have a like glory in ours.
   </p>
   <p>
    "He is our teacher. Morning and evening throughout the various world, in
   </p>
   <p>
    the procession of the seasons, and in the blue heavens powdered with
   </p>
   <p>
    stars; in mountain and plain and many-toned forest; in the sounding
   </p>
   <p>
    walls of the ocean, and in the billowy seas through which we pass in
   </p>
   <p>
    peril from land to land, we read his thoughts and listen to his voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here do we learn with what far-seeing intelligence he has laid the
   </p>
   <p>
    foundations of his everlasting mansion, how skillfully he has builded
   </p>
   <p>
    its walls, and with what prodigal richness he has decorated all his
   </p>
   <p>
    works. For the sunlight and moonlight and the blueness of heaven are
   </p>
   <p>
    his; the sea with its tides; the blackness and the lightnings of the
   </p>
   <p>
    tempest, and snow, and changeful winds, and green and yellow leaf; his
   </p>
   <p>
    are also the silver rain and the rainbow, the shadows and the
   </p>
   <p>
    many-colored mists, which he flings like a mantle over all the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    Herein do we learn that he loves a stable building, and that the
   </p>
   <p>
    foundations and walls shall endure for ever: yet loves not sameness;
   </p>
   <p>
    thus, from day to day and from season to season do all things change
   </p>
   <p>
    their aspect, and the walls and floor and roof of his dwelling are
   </p>
   <p>
    covered with a new glory. But to us it is not given to rise to this
   </p>
   <p>
    supreme majesty in our works; therefore do we, like him yet unable to
   </p>
   <p>
    reach so great a height, borrow nothing one from the other, but in each
   </p>
   <p>
    house learn separately from him alone who has infinite riches; so that
   </p>
   <p>
    every habitation, changeless and eternal in itself, shall yet differ
   </p>
   <p>
    from all others, having its own special beauty and splendor: for we
   </p>
   <p>
    inhabit one house only, but the Father of men inhabits all.
   </p>
   <p>
    "These things are written for the refreshment and delight of those who
   </p>
   <p>
    may no longer journey into distant lands; and they are in the library of
   </p>
   <p>
    the house in the seven thousand volumes of the Houses of the World which
   </p>
   <p>
    our pilgrims have visited in past ages. For once in a lifetime is it
   </p>
   <p>
    ordained that a man shall leave his own place and travel for the space
   </p>
   <p>
    of ten years, visiting the most famous houses in every land he enters,
   </p>
   <p>
    and also seeking out those of which no report has reached us.
   </p>
   <p>
    "When the time for this chief adventure comes, and we go forth for a
   </p>
   <p>
    long period, there is compensation for every weariness, with absence of
   </p>
   <p>
    kindred and the sweet shelter of our own home: for now do we learn the
   </p>
   <p>
    infinite riches of the Father; for just as the day changes every hour,
   </p>
   <p>
    from the morning to the evening twilight, so does the aspect of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world alter as we progress from day to day; and in all places our
   </p>
   <p>
    fellow-men, learning as we do from him only, and seeing that which is
   </p>
   <p>
    nearest, give a special color of nature to their lives and their houses;
   </p>
   <p>
    and every house, with the family which inhabits it, in their
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation and the arts in which they excel, is like a round lake set
   </p>
   <p>
    about with hills, wherein may be seen that visible world. And in all the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth there is no land without inhabitants, whether on wide continents
   </p>
   <p>
    or islands of the sea; and in all nature there is no grandeur or beauty
   </p>
   <p>
    or grace which men have not copied; knowing that this is pleasing to the
   </p>
   <p>
    Father: for we, that are made like him, delight not to work without
   </p>
   <p>
    witnesses; and we are his witnesses in the earth, taking pleasure in his
   </p>
   <p>
    works, even as he also does in ours.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Thus, at the beginning of our journey to the far south, where we go to
   </p>
   <p>
    look first on those bright lands, which have hotter suns and a greater
   </p>
   <p>
    variety than ours, we come to the wilderness of Coradine, which seems
   </p>
   <p>
    barren and desolate to our sight, accustomed to the deep verdure of
   </p>
   <p>
    woods and valleys, and the blue mists of an abundant moisture. There a
   </p>
   <p>
    stony soil brings forth only thorns, and thistles, and sere tufts of
   </p>
   <p>
    grass; and blustering winds rush over the unsheltered reaches, where the
   </p>
   <p>
    rough-haired goats huddle for warmth; and there is no melody save the
   </p>
   <p>
    many-toned voices of the wind and the plover's wild cry. There dwell the
   </p>
   <p>
    children of Coradine, on the threshold of the wind-vexed wilderness,
   </p>
   <p>
    where the stupendous columns of green glass uphold the roof of the House
   </p>
   <p>
    of Coradine; the ocean's voice is in their rooms, and the inland-blowing
   </p>
   <p>
    wind brings to them the salt spray and yellow sand swept at low tide
   </p>
   <p>
    from the desolate floors of the sea, and the white-winged bird flying
   </p>
   <p>
    from the black tempest screams aloud in their shadowy halls. There, from
   </p>
   <p>
    the high terraces, when the moon is at its full, we see the children of
   </p>
   <p>
    Coradine gathered together, arrayed like no others, in shining garments
   </p>
   <p>
    of gossamer threads, when, like thistle-down chased by eddying winds,
   </p>
   <p>
    now whirling in a cloud, now scattering far apart, they dance their
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlight dances on the wide alabaster floors; and coming and going they
   </p>
   <p>
    pass away, and seem to melt into the moonlight, yet ever to return again
   </p>
   <p>
    with changeful melody and new measures. And, seeing this, all those
   </p>
   <p>
    things in which we ourselves excel seem poor in comparison, becoming
   </p>
   <p>
    pale in our memories. For the winds and waves, and the whiteness and
   </p>
   <p>
    grace, has been ever with them; and the winged seed of the thistle, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the flight of the gull, and the storm-vexed sea, flowering in foam, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the light of the moon on sea and barren land, have taught them this art,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a swiftness and grace which they alone possess.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yet does this moonlight dance, which is the chief glory of the House of
   </p>
   <p>
    Coradine, grow pale in the mind, and is speedily forgotten, when another
   </p>
   <p>
    is seen; and, going on our way from house to house, we learn how
   </p>
   <p>
    everywhere the various riches of the world have been taken into his soul
   </p>
   <p>
    by man, and made part of his life. Nor are we inferior to others, having
   </p>
   <p>
    also an art and chief excellence which is ours only, and the fame of
   </p>
   <p>
    which has long gone forth into the world; so that from many distant
   </p>
   <p>
    lands pilgrims gather yearly to our fields to listen to our harvest
   </p>
   <p>
    melody, when the sun-ripened fruits have been garnered, and our lips and
   </p>
   <p>
    hands make undying music, to gladden the hearts of those that hear it
   </p>
   <p>
    all their lives long. For then do we rejoice beyond others, rising like
   </p>
   <p>
    bright-winged insects from our lowly state to a higher life of glory and
   </p>
   <p>
    joy, which is ours for the space of three whole days. Then the august
   </p>
   <p>
    Mother, in a brazen chariot, is drawn from field to field by milk-white
   </p>
   <p>
    bulls with golden horns; then her children are gathered about her in
   </p>
   <p>
    shining yellow garments, with armlets of gold upon their arms; and with
   </p>
   <p>
    voice and instruments of forms unknown to the stranger, they make glad
   </p>
   <p>
    the listening fields with the great harvest melody.
   </p>
   <p>
    "In ancient days the children of our house conceived it in their hearts,
   </p>
   <p>
    hearing it in all nature's voices; and it was with them day and night,
   </p>
   <p>
    and they whispered it to one another when it was no louder than the
   </p>
   <p>
    whisper of the wind in the forest leaves; and as the Builder of the
   </p>
   <p>
    world brings from an hundred far places the mist, and the dew, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    sunshine, and the light west wind, to give to the morning hour its
   </p>
   <p>
    freshness and glory; and as we, his humbler followers, seek far off in
   </p>
   <p>
    caverns of the hills and in the dark bowels of the earth for minerals
   </p>
   <p>
    and dyes that outshine the flowers and the sun, to beautify the walls of
   </p>
   <p>
    our house, so everywhere by night and day for long centuries did we
   </p>
   <p>
    listen to all sounds, and made their mystery and melody ours, until this
   </p>
   <p>
    great song was perfected in our hearts, and the fame of it in all lands
   </p>
   <p>
    has caused our house to be called the House of the Harvest Melody; and
   </p>
   <p>
    when the yearly pilgrims behold our procession in the fields, and listen
   </p>
   <p>
    to our song, all the glory of the world seems to pass before them,
   </p>
   <p>
    overcoming their hearts, until, bursting into tears and loud cries, they
   </p>
   <p>
    cast themselves upon the earth and worship the Father of the whole
   </p>
   <p>
    world.
   </p>
   <p>
    "This shall be the chief glory of our house for ever; when a thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    years have gone by, and we that are now living, like those that have
   </p>
   <p>
    been, are mingled with the nature we come from, and speak to our
   </p>
   <p>
    children only in the wind's voice, and the cry of the passage-bird,
   </p>
   <p>
    pilgrims shall still come to these sun-bright fields, to rejoice, and
   </p>
   <p>
    worship the Father of the world, and bless the august Mother of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, from whose sacred womb ever comes to it life and love and joy,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the harvest melody that shall endure for ever."
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 6
   </p>
   <p>
    The reading went on, not of course "for ever," like that harvest melody
   </p>
   <p>
    he spoke of, but for a considerable time. The words, I concluded, were
   </p>
   <p>
    for the initiated, and not for me, and after a while I gave up trying to
   </p>
   <p>
    make out what it was all about. Those last expressions I have quoted
   </p>
   <p>
    about the "august Mother of the house" were unintelligible, and appeared
   </p>
   <p>
    to me meaningless. I had already come to the conclusion that however
   </p>
   <p>
    many of the ladies of the establishment might have experienced the
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasures and pains of maternity, there was really no mother of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house in the sense that there was a father of the house: that is to say,
   </p>
   <p>
    one possessing authority over the others and calling them all her
   </p>
   <p>
    children indiscriminately. Yet this mysterious non-existent mother of
   </p>
   <p>
    the house was continually being spoken of, as I found now and afterwards
   </p>
   <p>
    when I listened to the talk around me. After thinking the matter over, I
   </p>
   <p>
    came to the conclusion that "mother of the house" was merely a
   </p>
   <p>
    convenient fiction, and simply stood for the general sense of the
   </p>
   <p>
    women-folk, or something of the sort. It was perhaps stupid of me, but
   </p>
   <p>
    the story of Mistrelde, who died young, leaving only eight children, I
   </p>
   <p>
    had regarded as a mere legend or fable of antiquity.
   </p>
   <p>
    To return to the reading. Just as I had been absorbed before in that
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful book without being able to read it, so now I listened to that
   </p>
   <p>
    melodious and majestic voice, experiencing a singular pleasure without
   </p>
   <p>
    properly understanding the sense. I remembered now with a painful
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling of inferiority that my thick speech had been remarked On
   </p>
   <p>
    earlier in the day; and I could not but think that, compared with the
   </p>
   <p>
    speech of this people, it was thick. In their rare physical beauty, the
   </p>
   <p>
    color of their eyes and hair, and in their fascinating dress, they had
   </p>
   <p>
    struck me as being utterly unlike any people ever seen by me. But it was
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps in their clear, sweet, penetrative voice, which sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    reminded me of a tender-toned wind instrument, that they most differed
   </p>
   <p>
    from others.
   </p>
   <p>
    The reading, I have said, had struck me as almost of the nature of a
   </p>
   <p>
    religious service; nevertheless, everything went on as before--reading,
   </p>
   <p>
    working, and occasional conversation; but the subdued talking and moving
   </p>
   <p>
    about did not interfere with one's pleasure in the old man's musical
   </p>
   <p>
    speech any more than the soft murmur and flying about of honey bees
   </p>
   <p>
    would prevent one from enjoying the singing of a skylark. Emboldened by
   </p>
   <p>
    what I saw the others doing, I left my seat and made my way across the
   </p>
   <p>
    floor to Yoletta's side, stealing through the gloom with great caution
   </p>
   <p>
    to avoid making a clatter with those abominable boots.
   </p>
   <p>
    "May I sit down near you?" said I with some hesitation; but she
   </p>
   <p>
    encouraged me with a smile and placed a cushion for me.
   </p>
   <p>
    I settled myself down in the most graceful position I could assume,
   </p>
   <p>
    which was not at all graceful, doubling my objectionable legs out of her
   </p>
   <p>
    sight; and then began my trouble, for I was greatly perplexed to know
   </p>
   <p>
    what to say to her. I thought of lawn-tennis and archery. Ellen Terry's
   </p>
   <p>
    acting, the Royal Academy Exhibition, private theatricals, and twenty
   </p>
   <p>
    things besides, but they all seemed unsuitable subjects to start
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation with in this case. There was, I began to fear, no common
   </p>
   <p>
    ground on which we could meet and exchange thoughts, or, at any rate,
   </p>
   <p>
    words. Then I remembered that ground, common and broad enough, of our
   </p>
   <p>
    human feelings, especially the sweet and important feeling of love. But
   </p>
   <p>
    how was I to lead up to it? The work she was engaged with at length
   </p>
   <p>
    suggested an opening, and the opportunity to make a pretty little
   </p>
   <p>
    speech.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Your sight must be as good as your eyes are pretty," said I, "to enable
   </p>
   <p>
    you to work in such a dim light."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, the light is good enough," she answered, taking no notice of the
   </p>
   <p>
    compliment. "Besides, this is such easy work I could do it in the dark."
   </p>
   <p>
    "It is very pretty work--may I look at it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    She handed the stuff to me, but instead of taking it in the ordinary
   </p>
   <p>
    way, I placed my hand under hers, and, holding up cloth and hand
   </p>
   <p>
    together, proceeded to give a minute and prolonged scrutiny to her work.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you know that I am enjoying two distinct pleasures at one and the
   </p>
   <p>
    same time?" said I. "One is in seeing your work, the other in holding
   </p>
   <p>
    your hand; and I think the last pleasure even greater than the first."
   </p>
   <p>
    As she made no reply, I added somewhat lamely: "May I--keep on holding
   </p>
   <p>
    it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "That would prevent me from working," she answered, with the utmost
   </p>
   <p>
    gravity. "But you may hold it for a little while."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, thank you," I exclaimed, delighted with the privilege; and then, to
   </p>
   <p>
    make the most of my precious "little while," I pressed it warmly,
   </p>
   <p>
    whereupon she cried out aloud: "Oh, Smith, you are squeezing too
   </p>
   <p>
    hard--you hurt my hand!"
   </p>
   <p>
    I dropped it instantly in the greatest confusion. "Oh, for goodness
   </p>
   <p>
    sake," I stammered, "please, do not make such an outcry! You don't know
   </p>
   <p>
    what a hobble you'll get me into."
   </p>
   <p>
    Fortunately, no notice was taken of the exclamation, though it was hard
   </p>
   <p>
    to believe that her words had not been overheard; and presently,
   </p>
   <p>
    recovering from my fright, I apologized for hurting her, and hoped she
   </p>
   <p>
    would forgive me.
   </p>
   <p>
    "There is nothing to forgive," she returned gently. "You did not really
   </p>
   <p>
    squeeze hard, only my hand hurts, because to-day when I pressed it on
   </p>
   <p>
    the ground beside the grave I ran a small thorn into it." Then the
   </p>
   <p>
    remembrance of that scene at the burial brought a sudden mist of tears
   </p>
   <p>
    into her lovely eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am so sorry I hurt you, Yoletta--may I call you Yoletta?" said I, all
   </p>
   <p>
    at once remembering that she had called me Smith, without the customary
   </p>
   <p>
    prefix.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, that is my name--what else should you call me?" she returned,
   </p>
   <p>
    evidently with surprise.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It is a pretty name, and so sweet on the lips that I should like to be
   </p>
   <p>
    repeating it continually," I answered. "But it is only right that you
   </p>
   <p>
    should have a pretty name, because--well, if I may tell you, because you
   </p>
   <p>
    are so very beautiful."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes; but is that strange--are not all people beautiful?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought of certain London types, especially among the "criminal
   </p>
   <p>
    classes," and of the old women with withered, simian faces and wearing
   </p>
   <p>
    shawls, slinking in or out of public-houses at the street corners; and
   </p>
   <p>
    also of some people of a better class I had known personally--some even
   </p>
   <p>
    in the House of Commons; and I felt that I could not agree with her,
   </p>
   <p>
    much as I wished to do so, without straining my conscience.
   </p>
   <p>
    "At all events, you will allow," said I, evading the question, "that
   </p>
   <p>
    there are degrees of beauty, just as there are degrees of light.
   </p>
   <p>
    You may be able to see to work in this light, but it is very faint
   </p>
   <p>
    compared with the noonday light when the sun is shining."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, there is not so great a difference between people as that,"
   </p>
   <p>
    she replied, with the air of a philosopher. "There are different kinds
   </p>
   <p>
    of beauty, I allow, and some people seem more beautiful to us than
   </p>
   <p>
    others, but that is only because we love them more. The best loved are
   </p>
   <p>
    always the most beautiful."
   </p>
   <p>
    This seemed to reverse the usual idea, that the more beautiful the
   </p>
   <p>
    person is the more he or she gets loved. However, I was not going to
   </p>
   <p>
    disagree with her any more, and only said: "How sweetly you talk,
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta; you are as wise as you are beautiful. I could wish for no
   </p>
   <p>
    greater pleasure than to sit here listening to you the whole evening."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Ah, then, I am sorry I must leave you now," she answered, with a bright
   </p>
   <p>
    smile which made me think that perhaps my little speech had pleased her.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you wonder why I smile?" she added, as if able to read my thoughts.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It is because I have often heard words like yours from one who is
   </p>
   <p>
    waiting for me now."
   </p>
   <p>
    This speech caused me a jealous pang. But for a few moments after
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking, she continued regarding me with that bright, spiritual smile
   </p>
   <p>
    on her lips; then it faded, and her face clouded and her glance fell. I
   </p>
   <p>
    did not ask her to tell me, nor did I ask myself, the reason of that
   </p>
   <p>
    change; and afterwards how often I noticed that same change in her, and
   </p>
   <p>
    in the others too--that sudden silence and clouding of the face, such as
   </p>
   <p>
    may be seen in one who freely expresses himself to a person who cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    hear, and then, all at once but too late, remembers the other's
   </p>
   <p>
    infirmity.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Must you go?" I only said. "What shall I do alone?".
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, you shall not be alone," she replied, and going away returned
   </p>
   <p>
    presently with another lady. "This is Edra," she said simply. "She will
   </p>
   <p>
    take my place by your side and talk with you."
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not tell her that she had taken my words too literally, that
   </p>
   <p>
    being alone simply meant being separated from her; but there was no help
   </p>
   <p>
    for it, and some one, alas! some one I greatly hated was waiting for
   </p>
   <p>
    her. I could only thank her and her friend for their kind intentions.
   </p>
   <p>
    But what in the name of goodness was I to say to this beautiful woman
   </p>
   <p>
    who was sitting by me? She was certainly very beautiful, with a far more
   </p>
   <p>
    mature and perhaps a nobler beauty than Yoletta's, her age being about
   </p>
   <p>
    twenty-seven or twenty-eight; but the divine charm in the young girl's
   </p>
   <p>
    face could, for me, exist in no other.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently she opened the conversation by asking me if I disliked being
   </p>
   <p>
    alone.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, no, perhaps not exactly that," I said; "but I think it much
   </p>
   <p>
    jollier--much more pleasant, I mean--to have some very nice person to
   </p>
   <p>
    talk to."
   </p>
   <p>
    She assented, and, pleased at her ready intelligence, I added: "And it
   </p>
   <p>
    is particularly pleasant when you are understood. But I have no fear
   </p>
   <p>
    that you, at any rate, will fail to understand anything I may say."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You have had some trouble to-day," she returned, with a charming smile.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I sometimes think that women can understand even more readily than
   </p>
   <p>
    men."
   </p>
   <p>
    "There's not a doubt of it!" I returned warmly, glad to find that with
   </p>
   <p>
    Edra it was all plain sailing. "It must be patent to every one that
   </p>
   <p>
    women have far quicker, finer intellects than men, although their brains
   </p>
   <p>
    are smaller; but then quality is more important than mere quantity. And
   </p>
   <p>
    yet," I continued, "some people hold that women ought not to have the
   </p>
   <p>
    franchise, or suffrage, or whatever it is! Not that I care two straws
   </p>
   <p>
    about the question myself, and I only hope they'll never get it; but
   </p>
   <p>
    then I think it is so illogical--don't you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am afraid I do not understand you, Smith," she returned, looking much
   </p>
   <p>
    distressed.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, no, I suppose not, but what I said was of no consequence," I
   </p>
   <p>
    replied; then, wishing to make a fresh start, I added: "But I am so glad
   </p>
   <p>
    to hear you call me Smith. It makes it so much more pleasant and
   </p>
   <p>
    homelike to be treated without formality. It is very kind of you, I'm
   </p>
   <p>
    sure."
   </p>
   <p>
    "But surely your name is Smith?" said she, looking very much surprised.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh yes, my name is Smith: only of course--well, the tact is, I was just
   </p>
   <p>
    wondering what to call you."
   </p>
   <p>
    "My name is Edra," she replied, looking more bewildered than ever; and
   </p>
   <p>
    from that moment the conversation, which had begun so favorably, was
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing but a series of entanglements, from which I could only escape in
   </p>
   <p>
    each case by breaking the threads of the subject under discussion, and
   </p>
   <p>
    introducing a new one.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 7
   </p>
   <p>
    The moment of retiring, to which I had been looking forward with
   </p>
   <p>
    considerable interest as one likely to bring fresh surprises, arrived at
   </p>
   <p>
    last: it brought only extreme discomfort. I was conducted (without a
   </p>
   <p>
    flat candlestick) along an obscure passage; then, at right angles with
   </p>
   <p>
    the first, a second broader, lighter passage, leading past a great many
   </p>
   <p>
    doors placed near together. These, I ascertained later, were the
   </p>
   <p>
    dormitories, or sleeping-cells, and were placed side by side in a row
   </p>
   <p>
    opening on the terrace at the back of the house. Having reached the door
   </p>
   <p>
    of my box, my conductor pushed back the sliding-panel, and when I had
   </p>
   <p>
    groped my way to the dark interior, closed it again behind me. There was
   </p>
   <p>
    no light for me except the light of the stars; for directly opposite the
   </p>
   <p>
    door by which I had entered stood another, open wide to the night, which
   </p>
   <p>
    was apparently not intended ever to be closed. The prospect was the one
   </p>
   <p>
    I had already seen--the wilderness sloping to the river, and the glassy
   </p>
   <p>
    surface of the broad water, reflecting the stars, and the black masses
   </p>
   <p>
    of large trees. There was no sound save the hooting of an owl in the
   </p>
   <p>
    distance, and the wailing note of some mournful-minded water-fowl. The
   </p>
   <p>
    night air blew in cold and moist, which made my bones ache, though they
   </p>
   <p>
    were not broken; and feeling very sleepy and miserable, I groped about
   </p>
   <p>
    until I Was rewarded by discovering a narrow bed, or cot of
   </p>
   <p>
    trellis-work, on which was a hard straw pallet and a small straw pillow;
   </p>
   <p>
    also, folded small, a kind of woolen sleeping garment. Too tired to keep
   </p>
   <p>
    out of even such an uninviting bed, I flung off my clothes, and with my
   </p>
   <p>
    moldy tweeds for only covering I laid me down, but not to sleep. The
   </p>
   <p>
    misery of it! for although my body was warm--too warm, in fact--the wind
   </p>
   <p>
    blew on my face and bare feet and legs, and made it impossible to sleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    About midnight, I was just falling into a doze when a sound as of a
   </p>
   <p>
    person coming with a series of jumps into the room disturbed me; and
   </p>
   <p>
    starting up I was horrified to see, sitting on the floor, a great beast
   </p>
   <p>
    much too big for a dog, with large, erect ears. He was intently watching
   </p>
   <p>
    me, his round eyes shining like a pair of green phosphorescent globes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Having no weapon, I was at the brute's mercy, and was about to utter a
   </p>
   <p>
    loud shout to summon assistance, but as he sat so still I refrained, and
   </p>
   <p>
    began even to hope that he would go quietly away. Then he stood up, went
   </p>
   <p>
    back to the door and sniffed audibly at it; and thinking that he was
   </p>
   <p>
    about to relieve me of his unwelcome presence, I dropped my head on the
   </p>
   <p>
    pillow and lay perfectly still. Then he turned and glared at me again,
   </p>
   <p>
    and finally, advancing deliberately to my side, sniffed at my face. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was all over with me now, I thought, and closing my eyes, and feeling my
   </p>
   <p>
    forehead growing remarkably moist in spite of the cold, I murmured a
   </p>
   <p>
    little prayer. When I looked again the brute had vanished, to my
   </p>
   <p>
    inexpressible relief.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seemed very astonishing that an animal like a wolf should come into
   </p>
   <p>
    the house; but I soon remembered that I had seen no dogs about, so that
   </p>
   <p>
    all kinds of savage, prowling beasts could come in with impunity. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    getting beyond a joke: but then all this seemed only a fit ending to the
   </p>
   <p>
    perfectly absurd arrangement into which I had been induced to enter.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Goodness gracious!" I exclaimed, sitting bolt upright on my straw bed,
   </p>
   <p>
    "am I a rational being or an inebriated donkey, or what, to have
   </p>
   <p>
    consented to such a proposal? It is clear that I was not quite in my
   </p>
   <p>
    right mind when I made the agreement, and I am therefore not morally
   </p>
   <p>
    bound to observe it. What! be a field laborer, a hewer of wood and
   </p>
   <p>
    drawer of water, and sleep on a miserable straw mat in an open porch,
   </p>
   <p>
    with wolves for visitors at all hours of the night, and all for a few
   </p>
   <p>
    barbarous rags! I don't know much about plowing and that sort of thing,
   </p>
   <p>
    but I suppose any able-bodied man can earn a pound a week, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    would be fifty-two pounds for a suit of clothes. Who ever heard of such
   </p>
   <p>
    a thing! Wolves and all thrown in for nothing! I daresay I shall have a
   </p>
   <p>
    tiger dropping in presently just to have a look round. No, no, my
   </p>
   <p>
    venerable friend, that was all excellent acting about my extraordinary
   </p>
   <p>
    delusions, and the rest of it, but I am not going to be carried so far
   </p>
   <p>
    by them as to adhere to such an outrageously one-sided bargain."
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently I remembered two things--divine Yoletta was the first; and the
   </p>
   <p>
    second was that thought of the rare pleasure it would be to array myself
   </p>
   <p>
    in those same "barbarous rags," as I had blasphemously called them.
   </p>
   <p>
    These things had entered into my soul, and had become a part of
   </p>
   <p>
    me--especially--well, both. Those strange garments had looked so
   </p>
   <p>
    refreshingly picturesque, and I had conceived such an intense longing to
   </p>
   <p>
    wear them! Was it a very contemptible ambition on my part? Is it sinful
   </p>
   <p>
    to wish for any adornments other than wisdom and sobriety, a meek and
   </p>
   <p>
    loving spirit, good works, and other things of the kind? Straight into
   </p>
   <p>
    my brain flashed the words of a sentence I had recently read--that is to
   </p>
   <p>
    say, just before my accident--in a biological work, and it comforted me
   </p>
   <p>
    as much as if an angel with shining face and rainbow-colored wings had
   </p>
   <p>
    paid me a visit in my dusky cell: "Unto Adam also, and his wife, did the
   </p>
   <p>
    Lord God make coats of skin and clothed them. This has become, as every
   </p>
   <p>
    one knows, a custom among the race of men, and shows at present no sign
   </p>
   <p>
    of becoming obsolete. Moreover, that first correlation, namely,
   </p>
   <p>
    milk-glands and a hairy covering, appears to have entered the very soul
   </p>
   <p>
    of creatures of this class, and to have become psychical as well as
   </p>
   <p>
    physical, for in that type, which is only for a while inferior to
   </p>
   <p>
    the angels, the fondness for this kind of outer covering is a strong,
   </p>
   <p>
    ineradicable passion!" Most true and noble words, O biologist of the
   </p>
   <p>
    fiery soul! It was a delight to remember them. A "strong and
   </p>
   <p>
    ineradicable passion," not merely to clothe the body, but to clothe it
   </p>
   <p>
    appropriately, that is to say, beautifully, and by so doing please God
   </p>
   <p>
    and ourselves. This being so, must we go on for ever scraping our faces
   </p>
   <p>
    with a sharp iron, until they are blue and spotty with manifold
   </p>
   <p>
    scrapings; and cropping our hair short to give ourselves an artificial
   </p>
   <p>
    resemblance to old dogs and monkeys--creatures lower than us in the
   </p>
   <p>
    scale of being--and array our bodies, like mutes at a funeral, in
   </p>
   <p>
    repulsive black--we, "Eutheria of the Eutheria, the noble of the noble?"
   </p>
   <p>
    And all for what, since it pleases not heaven nor accords with our own
   </p>
   <p>
    desires? For the sake of respectability, perhaps, whatever that may
   </p>
   <p>
    mean. Oh, then, a million curses take it--respectability, I mean; may it
   </p>
   <p>
    sink into the bottomless pit, and the smoke of its torment ascend for
   </p>
   <p>
    ever and ever! And having thus, by taking thought, brought my mind into
   </p>
   <p>
    this temper, I once more finally determined to have the clothes, and
   </p>
   <p>
    religiously to observe the compact.
   </p>
   <p>
    It made me quite happy to end it in this way. The hard bed, the cold
   </p>
   <p>
    night wind blowing on me, my wolfish visitor, were all forgotten. Once
   </p>
   <p>
    more I gave loose to my imagination, and saw myself (clothed and in my
   </p>
   <p>
    right mind) sitting at Yoletta's feet, learning the mystery of that
   </p>
   <p>
    sweet, tranquil life from her precious lips. A whole year was mine in
   </p>
   <p>
    which to love her and win her gentle heart. But her hand--ah, that was
   </p>
   <p>
    another matter. What had I to give in return for such a boon as that?
   </p>
   <p>
    Only that strength concerning which my venerable host had spoken
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat encouragingly. He had also been so good as to mention my skill;
   </p>
   <p>
    but I could scarcely trade on that. And if a whole year's labor was only
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficient to pay for a suit of clothing, how many years of toil would
   </p>
   <p>
    be required to win Yoletta's hand?
   </p>
   <p>
    Naturally, at this juncture, I began to draw a parallel between my case
   </p>
   <p>
    and that of an ancient historical personage, whose name is familiar to
   </p>
   <p>
    most. History repeats itself--with variations. Jacob--namely,
   </p>
   <p>
    Smith--cometh to the well of Haran. He taketh acquaintance of Rachel,
   </p>
   <p>
    here called Yoletta. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice
   </p>
   <p>
    and wept. That is a touch of nature I can thoroughly appreciate--the
   </p>
   <p>
    kissing, I mean; but why he wept I cannot tell, unless it be because he
   </p>
   <p>
    was not an Englishman. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's
   </p>
   <p>
    brother. I am glad to have no such startling piece of information to
   </p>
   <p>
    give to the object of my affections: we are not even distant relations,
   </p>
   <p>
    and her age being, say, fifteen, and mine twenty-one, we are so far well
   </p>
   <p>
    suited to each other, according to my notions. Smith covenanted! for
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta, and said: "I will serve thee seven years for Yoletta, thy
   </p>
   <p>
    younger daughter"; and the old gentleman answered: "Abide with me, for I
   </p>
   <p>
    would rather you should have her than some other person." Now I wonder
   </p>
   <p>
    whether the matter will be complicated with Leah--that is, Edra? Leah
   </p>
   <p>
    was considerably older than Rachel, and, like Edra, tender-eyed. I do
   </p>
   <p>
    not aspire or desire to marry both, especially if I should, like Jacob,
   </p>
   <p>
    have to begin with the wrong one, however tender-eyed: but for divine
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta I could serve seven years; yea, and fourteen, if it comes to it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus I mused, and thus I questioned, tossing and turning on my
   </p>
   <p>
    inhospitable hard bed, until merciful sleep laid her quieting hands on
   </p>
   <p>
    the strings of my brain, and hushed their weary jangling.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 8
   </p>
   <p>
    Fortunately I woke early next morning, for I was now a member of an
   </p>
   <p>
    early-rising family, and anxious to conform to rules. On going to the
   </p>
   <p>
    door I found, to my inexpressible disgust, that I might easily have
   </p>
   <p>
    closed it in the way I had seen the other door closed, by simply pulling
   </p>
   <p>
    a sliding panel. There was ventilation enough without having the place
   </p>
   <p>
    open to prowling beasts of prey. I also found that if I had turned up
   </p>
   <p>
    the little stray bed I should have had warm woolen sheets to sleep in.
   </p>
   <p>
    I resolved to say nothing about my nocturnal visitor, not wishing to
   </p>
   <p>
    begin the day by furnishing fresh instances of what might seem like
   </p>
   <p>
    crass stupidity on my part. While occupied with these matters I began to
   </p>
   <p>
    hear people moving about and talking on the terrace, and peeping out, I
   </p>
   <p>
    beheld a curious and interesting spectacle. Down the broad steps leading
   </p>
   <p>
    to the water the people of the house were hurrying, and flinging
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves like agile, startled frogs on the bosom of the stream. There,
   </p>
   <p>
    in the midst of his family, my venerable host was already disporting
   </p>
   <p>
    himself, his long, silvery beard and hair floating like a foam on the
   </p>
   <p>
    waves of his own creating. And presently from other sleeping-rooms on a
   </p>
   <p>
    line with mine shot forth new bewitching forms, each sparsely clothed in
   </p>
   <p>
    a slender clinging garment, which concealed no beauteous curve beneath;
   </p>
   <p>
    and nimbly running and leaping down the slope, they quickly joined the
   </p>
   <p>
    masculine bathers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Looking about I soon found a pretty thing in which to array myself, and
   </p>
   <p>
    quickly started after the others, risking my neck in my desire to
   </p>
   <p>
    imitate the new mode of motion I had just witnessed. The water was
   </p>
   <p>
    delightfully cool and refreshing, and the company very agreeable, ladies
   </p>
   <p>
    and gentlemen all swimming and diving about together with the
   </p>
   <p>
    unconventional freedom and grace of a company of grebes.
   </p>
   <p>
    After dressing, we assembled in the eating-room or portico where we had
   </p>
   <p>
    supped, just when the red disk of the sun was showing itself above the
   </p>
   <p>
    horizon, kindling the clouds with yellow flame, and filling the green
   </p>
   <p>
    world with new light. I felt happy and strong that morning, very able
   </p>
   <p>
    and willing to work in the fields, and, better than all, very hopeful
   </p>
   <p>
    about that affair of the heart. Happiness, however, is seldom perfect,
   </p>
   <p>
    and in the clear, tender morning light I could not help contrasting my
   </p>
   <p>
    own repulsively ugly garments with the bright and beautiful costumes
   </p>
   <p>
    worn by the others, which seemed to harmonize so well with their fresh,
   </p>
   <p>
    happy morning mood. I also missed the fragrant cup of coffee, the
   </p>
   <p>
    streaky rasher from the dear familiar pig, and, after breakfast, the
   </p>
   <p>
    well-flavored cigar; but these lesser drawbacks were soon forgotten.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the meal a small closed basket was handed to me, and one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    young men led me out to a little distance from the house, then, pointing
   </p>
   <p>
    to a belt of wood about a mile away, told me to walk towards it until I
   </p>
   <p>
    came to a plowed field on the slope of a valley, where I could do some
   </p>
   <p>
    plowing. Before leaving me he took from his own person a metal
   </p>
   <p>
    dog-whistle, with a string attached, and hung it round my neck, but
   </p>
   <p>
    without explaining its use.
   </p>
   <p>
    Basket in hand I went away, over the dewy grass, whistling
   </p>
   <p>
    light-heartedly, and after half an hour's walk found the spot indicated,
   </p>
   <p>
    where about an acre and a half of land had been recently turned; there
   </p>
   <p>
    also, lying in the furrow, I found the plow, an implement I knew very
   </p>
   <p>
    little about. This particular plow, however, appeared to be a simple,
   </p>
   <p>
    primitive thing, consisting of a long beam of wood, with an upright pole
   </p>
   <p>
    to guide it; a metal share in the center, going off to one side,
   </p>
   <p>
    balanced on the other by a couple of small wheels; and there were also
   </p>
   <p>
    some long ropes attached to a cross-stick at the end of the beam. There
   </p>
   <p>
    being no horses or bullocks to do the work, and being unable to draw the
   </p>
   <p>
    plow myself as well as guide it, I sat down leisurely to examine the
   </p>
   <p>
    contents of my basket, which, I found, consisted of brown bread, dried
   </p>
   <p>
    fruit, and a stone bottle of milk. Then, not knowing what else to do, I
   </p>
   <p>
    began to amuse myself by blowing on the whistle, and emitted a most
   </p>
   <p>
    shrill and piercing sound, which very soon produced an unexpected
   </p>
   <p>
    effect. Two noble-looking horses, resembling those I had seen the day
   </p>
   <p>
    before, came galloping towards me as if in response to the sound I had
   </p>
   <p>
    made. Approaching swiftly to within fifty yards they stood still,
   </p>
   <p>
    staring and snorting as if alarmed or astonished, after which they swept
   </p>
   <p>
    round me three or four times, neighing in a sharp, ringing manner, and
   </p>
   <p>
    finally, after having exhausted their superfluous energy, they walked to
   </p>
   <p>
    the plow and placed themselves deliberately before it. It looked as if
   </p>
   <p>
    these animals had come at my call to do the work; I therefore approached
   </p>
   <p>
    them, with more than needful caution, using many soothing, conciliatory
   </p>
   <p>
    sounds and words the while, and after a little further study I
   </p>
   <p>
    discovered how to adjust the ropes to them. There were no blinkers or
   </p>
   <p>
    reins, nor did these superb animals seem to think any were wanted; but
   </p>
   <p>
    after I had taken the pole in my hand, and said "Gee up, Dobbin," in a
   </p>
   <p>
    tone of command, followed by some inarticulate clicks with the tongue,
   </p>
   <p>
    they rewarded me with a disconcerting stare, and then began dragging the
   </p>
   <p>
    plow. As long as I held the pole straight the share cut its way evenly
   </p>
   <p>
    through the mold, but occasionally, owing to my inadvertence, it would
   </p>
   <p>
    go off at a tangent or curve quite out of the ground; and whenever this
   </p>
   <p>
    happened the horses would stop, turn round and stare at me, then,
   </p>
   <p>
    touching their noses together seem to exchange ideas on the subject.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the first furrow was finished, they did not double back, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    expected, but went straight away to a distance of thirty yards, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then, turning, marched back, cutting a fresh furrow parallel with the
   </p>
   <p>
    first, and as straight as a line. Then they returned to the original
   </p>
   <p>
    starting-point and cut another, then again to the new furrow, and so on
   </p>
   <p>
    progressively. All this seemed very wonderful to me, giving the
   </p>
   <p>
    impression that I had been a skillful plowman all my life without
   </p>
   <p>
    knowing it. It was interesting work; and I was also amused to see the
   </p>
   <p>
    little birds that came in numbers from the wood to devour the worms in
   </p>
   <p>
    the fresh-turned mold; for between their fear of me and their desire to
   </p>
   <p>
    get the worms, they were in a highly perplexed state, and generally
   </p>
   <p>
    confined their operations to one end of the furrow while I was away at
   </p>
   <p>
    the other. The space the horses had marked out for themselves was plowed
   </p>
   <p>
    up in due time, whereupon they marched off and made a fresh furrow as
   </p>
   <p>
    before, where there was nothing to guide them; and so the work went on
   </p>
   <p>
    agreeably for some hours, until I felt myself growing desperately
   </p>
   <p>
    hungry. Sitting down on the beam of the plow, I opened my basket and
   </p>
   <p>
    discussed the homely fare with a keen appetite.
   </p>
   <p>
    After finishing the food I resumed work again, but not as cheerfully as
   </p>
   <p>
    at first: I began to feel a little stiff and tired, and the immense
   </p>
   <p>
    quantity of mold adhering to my boots made it heavy walking; moreover,
   </p>
   <p>
    the novelty had now worn off. The horses also did not work as smoothly
   </p>
   <p>
    as at the commencement: they seemed to have something on their minds,
   </p>
   <p>
    for at the end of every furrow they would turn and stare at me in the
   </p>
   <p>
    most exasperating manner.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Phew!" I ejaculated, as I stood wiping the honest sweat from my face
   </p>
   <p>
    with my moldy, ancient, and extremely dirty pocket-handkerchief. "Three
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred and sixty-four days of this sort of thing is a rather long price
   </p>
   <p>
    to pay for a suit of clothes."
   </p>
   <p>
    While standing there, I saw an animal coming swiftly towards me from the
   </p>
   <p>
    direction of the forest, bounding along over the earth with a speed like
   </p>
   <p>
    that of a greyhound--a huge, fierce-looking brute; and when close to me,
   </p>
   <p>
    I felt convinced that it was an animal of the same kind as the one I had
   </p>
   <p>
    seen during the night. Before I had made up my mind what to do, he was
   </p>
   <p>
    within a few yards of me, and then, coming to a sudden halt, he sat down
   </p>
   <p>
    on his haunches, and gravely watched me. Calling to mind some things I
   </p>
   <p>
    had heard about the terrifying effect of the human eye on royal tigers
   </p>
   <p>
    and other savage beasts, I gazed steadily at him, and then almost lost
   </p>
   <p>
    my fear in admiration of his beauty. He was taller than a boarhound, but
   </p>
   <p>
    slender in figure, with keen, fox-like features, and very large, erect
   </p>
   <p>
    ears; his coat was silvery-gray, and long; there were two black spots
   </p>
   <p>
    above his eyes; and the feet, muzzle, ear-tips, and end of the bushy
   </p>
   <p>
    tail were also velvet-black. After watching me quietly for two or three
   </p>
   <p>
    minutes, he started up, and, much to my relief, trotted away towards the
   </p>
   <p>
    wood; but after going about fifty yards he looked back, and seeing me
   </p>
   <p>
    still gazing after him, wheeled round and rushed at me, and when quite
   </p>
   <p>
    close uttered a sound like a ringing, metallic yelp, after which he once
   </p>
   <p>
    more bounded away, and disappeared from sight.
   </p>
   <p>
    The horses now turned round, and, deliberately walking up to me, stood
   </p>
   <p>
    still, in spite of all I could do to make them continue the work. After
   </p>
   <p>
    waiting a while they proceeded to wriggle themselves out of the ropes,
   </p>
   <p>
    and galloped off, loudly neighing to each other, and flinging up their
   </p>
   <p>
    disdainful heels so as to send a shower of dirt over me. Left alone in
   </p>
   <p>
    this unceremonious fashion, I presently began to think that they knew
   </p>
   <p>
    more about the work than I did, and that, finding me indisposed to
   </p>
   <p>
    release them at the proper moment, they had taken the matter into their
   </p>
   <p>
    own hands, or hoofs rather. A little more pondering, and I also came to
   </p>
   <p>
    the conclusion that the singular wolf-like animal was only one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house-dogs; that he had visited me in the night to remind me that I was
   </p>
   <p>
    sleeping with the door open, and had come now to insist on a suspension
   </p>
   <p>
    of work.
   </p>
   <p>
    Glad at having discovered all these things without displaying my
   </p>
   <p>
    ignorance by asking questions, I took up my basket and started home.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 9
   </p>
   <p>
    When I arrived at the house I was met by the young man who had set me
   </p>
   <p>
    the morning's task; but he was taciturn now, and wore a cold, estranged
   </p>
   <p>
    look, which seemed to portend trouble. He at once led me to a part of
   </p>
   <p>
    the house at a distance from the hall, and into a large apartment I now
   </p>
   <p>
    saw for the first time. In a few moments the master of the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    followed by most of the other inmates, also entered, and on the faces of
   </p>
   <p>
    all of them I noticed the same cold, offended look.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The dickens take my luck!" said I to myself, beginning to feel
   </p>
   <p>
    extremely uncomfortable. "I suppose I have offended against the laws and
   </p>
   <p>
    customs by working the horses too long."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Smith," said the old man, advancing to the table, and depositing
   </p>
   <p>
    thereon a large volume he had brought with him, "come here, and read to
   </p>
   <p>
    me in this book."
   </p>
   <p>
    Advancing to the table, I saw that it was written in the same minute,
   </p>
   <p>
    Hebrew-like characters of the folio I had examined on the previous
   </p>
   <p>
    evening. "I cannot read it; I do not understand the letters," I said,
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling some shame at having thus publicly to confess my ignorance.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Then," said he, bending on me a look of the utmost severity, "there is
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed little more to be said. Nevertheless, we take into account the
   </p>
   <p>
    confused state of your intellect yesterday, and judge you leniently; and
   </p>
   <p>
    let us hope that the pangs of an outraged conscience will be more
   </p>
   <p>
    painful to you than the light punishment I am about to inflict for so
   </p>
   <p>
    destestable a crime."
   </p>
   <p>
    I now concluded that I had offended by squeezing Yoletta's hand, and had
   </p>
   <p>
    been told to read from the book merely to make myself acquainted with
   </p>
   <p>
    the pains and penalties attendant on such an indiscretion, for to call
   </p>
   <p>
    it a "detestable crime" seemed to me a very great abuse of language.
   </p>
   <p>
    "If I have offended," was my answer, delivered with little humility, "I
   </p>
   <p>
    can only plead my ignorance of the customs of the house."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No man," he returned, with increased severity, "is so ignorant as not
   </p>
   <p>
    to know right from wrong. Had the matter come to my knowledge sooner, I
   </p>
   <p>
    should have said: Depart from us, for your continued presence in the
   </p>
   <p>
    house offends us; but we have made a compact with you, and, until the
   </p>
   <p>
    year expires, we must suffer you. For the space of sixty days you must
   </p>
   <p>
    dwell apart from us, never leaving the room, where each day a task will
   </p>
   <p>
    be assigned to you, and subsisting on bread and water only. Let us hope
   </p>
   <p>
    that in this period of solitude and silence you will sufficiently repent
   </p>
   <p>
    your crime, and rejoin us afterwards with a changed heart; for all
   </p>
   <p>
    offenses may be forgiven a man, but it is impossible to forgive a lie."
   </p>
   <p>
    "A lie!" I exclaimed in amazement. "I have told no lie!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "This," said he, with an access of wrath, "is an aggravation of your
   </p>
   <p>
    former offense. It is even a worse offense than the first, and must be
   </p>
   <p>
    dealt with separately--when the sixty days have expired."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Are you, then, going to condemn me without hearing me speak, or telling
   </p>
   <p>
    me anything about it? What lie have I told?"
   </p>
   <p>
    After a pause, during which he closely scrutinized my face, he said,
   </p>
   <p>
    pointing to the open page before him: "Yesterday, in answer to my
   </p>
   <p>
    question, you told me that you could read. Last evening you made a
   </p>
   <p>
    contrary statement to Yoletta; and now here is the book, and you confess
   </p>
   <p>
    that you cannot read it."
   </p>
   <p>
    "But that is easily explained," said I, immensely relieved, for I
   </p>
   <p>
    certainly had felt a little guilty about the hand-squeezing performance,
   </p>
   <p>
    although it was not a very serious matter. "I can read the books of my
   </p>
   <p>
    own country, and naturally concluded that your books were written in the
   </p>
   <p>
    same kind of letters; but last evening I discovered that it was not so.
   </p>
   <p>
    You have already seen the letters of my country on the coins I showed
   </p>
   <p>
    you last evening."
   </p>
   <p>
    And here I again pulled out my pocket-book, and emptied the contents on
   </p>
   <p>
    the table.
   </p>
   <p>
    He began to pick up the sovereigns one by one to examine them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile, finding my beautiful black and gold stylograph pen inserted
   </p>
   <p>
    in the book, I thought I could not do better than to show him how I
   </p>
   <p>
    wrote. Fortunately, the fluid in it had not become dry. Tearing a blank
   </p>
   <p>
    page from my book I hastily scribbled a few lines, and handed the paper
   </p>
   <p>
    to him, saying: "This is how I write."
   </p>
   <p>
    He began studying the paper, but his eyes, I perceived, wandered often
   </p>
   <p>
    to the stylograph pen in my hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently he remarked: "This writing, or these marks you have made on
   </p>
   <p>
    the paper, are not the same as the letters on the gold."
   </p>
   <p>
    I took the paper and proceeded to copy the sentence I had written, but
   </p>
   <p>
    in printing letters, beneath it, then returned it to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    He examined it again, and, after comparing my letters with those on the
   </p>
   <p>
    sovereigns, said: "Pray tell me, now, what you have written here, and
   </p>
   <p>
    explain why you write in two different ways?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I told him, as well as I could, why letters of one form were used to
   </p>
   <p>
    stamp on gold and other substances, and of a different form for writing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, with a modest blush, I read the words of the sentence: "In
   </p>
   <p>
    different parts of the world men have different customs, and write
   </p>
   <p>
    different letters; but alike to all men in all places, a lie is
   </p>
   <p>
    hateful."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Smith," he said, addressing me in an impressive manner, but happily not
   </p>
   <p>
    to charge me with a third and bigger lie, "I have lived long in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, and the knowledge others possess concerning it is mine also. It
   </p>
   <p>
    is common knowledge that in the hotter and colder regions men are
   </p>
   <p>
    compelled to live differently, owing to the conditions they are placed
   </p>
   <p>
    in; but we know that everywhere they have the same law of right and
   </p>
   <p>
    wrong inscribed on the heart, and, as you have said, hate a lie; also
   </p>
   <p>
    that they all speak the same language; and until this moment I also
   </p>
   <p>
    believed that they wrote in similar characters. You, however, have now
   </p>
   <p>
    succeeded in convincing me that this is not the case; that in some
   </p>
   <p>
    obscure valley, cut off from all intercourse by inaccessible mountains,
   </p>
   <p>
    or in some small, unknown island of the sea, a people may exist--ah, did
   </p>
   <p>
    you not tell me that you came from an island?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, my home was on an island," I answered.
   </p>
   <p>
    "So I imagined. An island of which no report has ever reached us, where
   </p>
   <p>
    the people, isolated from their fellows, have in the course of many
   </p>
   <p>
    centuries changed their customs--even their manner of writing. Although
   </p>
   <p>
    I had seen these gold pieces I did not understand, or did not realize,
   </p>
   <p>
    that such a human family existed: now I am persuaded of it, and as I
   </p>
   <p>
    alone am to blame for having brought this charge against you, I must now
   </p>
   <p>
    ask your forgiveness. We rejoice at your innocence, and hope with
   </p>
   <p>
    increased love to atone for our injustice. My son," he concluded,
   </p>
   <p>
    placing a hand on my shoulder, "I am now deeply in your debt."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am glad it has ended so happily," I replied, wondering whether his
   </p>
   <p>
    being in my debt would increase my chances with Yoletta or not.
   </p>
   <p>
    Seeing him again directing curious glances at the stylograph, which I
   </p>
   <p>
    was turning about in my fingers, I offered it to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    He examined it with interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I have only been waiting for an opportunity," he said, "to look closely
   </p>
   <p>
    at this wonderful contrivance, for I had perceived that your writing was
   </p>
   <p>
    not made with a pencil, but with a fluid. It is black polished stone,
   </p>
   <p>
    beautifully fashioned and encircled with gold bands, and contains the
   </p>
   <p>
    writing-fluid within itself. This surprises me as much as anything you
   </p>
   <p>
    have told me."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Allow me to make you a present of it," said I, seeing him so taken with
   </p>
   <p>
    it.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, not so," he returned. "But I should greatly like to possess it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    will keep it if I may bestow in return something you desire."
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta's hand was really the only thing in life I desired, but it was
   </p>
   <p>
    too early to speak yet, as I knew nothing about their matrimonial
   </p>
   <p>
    usages--not even whether or not the lady's consent was necessary to a
   </p>
   <p>
    compact of the kind. I therefore made a more modest request. "There is
   </p>
   <p>
    one thing I greatly desire," I said. "I am very anxious to be able to
   </p>
   <p>
    read in your books, and shall consider myself more than compensated if
   </p>
   <p>
    you will permit Yoletta to teach me."
   </p>
   <p>
    "She shall teach you in any case, my son," he returned. "That, and much
   </p>
   <p>
    more, is already owning to you."
   </p>
   <p>
    "There is nothing else I desire," said I. "Pray keep the pen and make me
   </p>
   <p>
    happy."
   </p>
   <p>
    And thus ended a disagreeable matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    The cloud having blown over, we all repaired to the supper-room, and
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing could exceed our happiness as we sat at meat--or vegetables. Not
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling so ravenously hungry as on the previous evening, and, moreover,
   </p>
   <p>
    seeing them all in so lively a mood, I did not hesitate to join in the
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation: nor did I succeed so very badly, considering the
   </p>
   <p>
    strangeness of it all; for like the bee that has been much hindered at
   </p>
   <p>
    his flowery work by geometric webs, I began to acquire some skill in
   </p>
   <p>
    pushing my way gracefully through the tangling meshes of thought and
   </p>
   <p>
    phrases that were new to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    The afternoon's experiences had certainly been remarkable--a strange
   </p>
   <p>
    mixture of pain and pleasure, not blending into homogeneous gray, but
   </p>
   <p>
    resembling rather a bright embroidery on a dark, somber ground; and of
   </p>
   <p>
    these surprising contrasts I was destined to have more that same
   </p>
   <p>
    evening.
   </p>
   <p>
    We were again assembled in the great room, the venerable father
   </p>
   <p>
    reclining at his ease on his throne-like couch near the brass globes,
   </p>
   <p>
    while the others pursued their various occupations as on the former
   </p>
   <p>
    evening. Not being able to get near Yoletta, and having nothing to do, I
   </p>
   <p>
    settled myself comfortably in one of the spacious seats, and gave up my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind to pleasant dreams. At length, to my surprise, the father, who had
   </p>
   <p>
    been regarding me for some time, said: "Will you lead, my son?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I started up, turning very red in the face, for I did not wish to
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble him with questions, yet was at a loss to know what he meant by
   </p>
   <p>
    leading. I thought of several things--whist, evening prayers, dancing,
   </p>
   <p>
    etc.; but being still in doubt, I was compelled to ask him to explain.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Will you lead the singing?" he returned, looking a little surprised.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh yes, with pleasure," said I. There being no music about, and no
   </p>
   <p>
    piano, I concluded naturally that my friends amused themselves with solo
   </p>
   <p>
    songs without accompaniment of an evening, and having a good tenor voice
   </p>
   <p>
    I was not unwilling to lead off with a song. Clearing my rusty throat
   </p>
   <p>
    with a ghrr-ghrr-hram which made them all jump, I launched forth
   </p>
   <p>
    with the "Vicar of Bray"--a grand old song and a great favorite of mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    They all started when I commenced, exchanging glances, and casting
   </p>
   <p>
    astonished looks towards me; but it was getting so dusky in the room
   </p>
   <p>
    that I could not feel sure that my eyes were not deceiving me. Presently
   </p>
   <p>
    some that were near me began retiring to distant seats, and this
   </p>
   <p>
    distressed me so that it made me hoarse, and my singing became very bad
   </p>
   <p>
    indeed; but still I thought it best to go bravely on to the end.
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly the old gentleman, who had been staring wildly at me for some
   </p>
   <p>
    time, drew up his long yellow robe and wrapped it round his face and
   </p>
   <p>
    head. I glanced at Yoletta, sitting at some distance, and saw that she
   </p>
   <p>
    was holding her hands pressed to her ears.
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought it about time to leave off then, and stopping abruptly in the
   </p>
   <p>
    middle of the fourth stanza I sat down, feeling extremely hot and
   </p>
   <p>
    uncomfortable. I was almost choking, and unable to utter a word. But
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no word for me to utter: it was, of course, for them to thank
   </p>
   <p>
    me for singing, or to say something; but not a word was spoken. Yoletta
   </p>
   <p>
    dropped her hands and resumed her work, while the old man slowly emerged
   </p>
   <p>
    with a somewhat frightened look from the wrappings; and then the long
   </p>
   <p>
    dead silence becoming unendurable, I remarked that I feared my singing
   </p>
   <p>
    was not to their taste. No reply was made; only the father, putting out
   </p>
   <p>
    one of his hands, touched a handle or key near him, whereupon one of the
   </p>
   <p>
    brass globes began slowly revolving. A low murmur of sound arose, and
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to pass like a wave through the room, dying away in the distance,
   </p>
   <p>
    soon to be succeeded by another, and then another, each marked by an
   </p>
   <p>
    increase of power; and often as this solemn sound died away, faint
   </p>
   <p>
    flute-like notes were heard as if approaching, but still at a great
   </p>
   <p>
    distance, and in the ensuing wave of sound from the great globes they
   </p>
   <p>
    would cease to be distinguishable. Still the mysterious coming sounds
   </p>
   <p>
    continued at intervals to grow louder and clearer, joined by other tones
   </p>
   <p>
    as they progressed, now altogether bursting out in joyous chorus, then
   </p>
   <p>
    one purest liquid note soaring bird-like alone, but whether from voices
   </p>
   <p>
    or wind-instruments I was unable to tell, until the whole air about me
   </p>
   <p>
    was filled and palpitating with the strange, exquisite harmony, which
   </p>
   <p>
    passed onwards, the tones growing fewer and fainter by degrees until
   </p>
   <p>
    they almost died out of hearing in the opposite direction. That all were
   </p>
   <p>
    now taking part in the performance I became convinced by watching in
   </p>
   <p>
    turn different individuals, some of them having small, curiously-shaped
   </p>
   <p>
    instruments in their hands, but there was a blending of voices and a
   </p>
   <p>
    something like ventriloquism in the tones which made it impossible to
   </p>
   <p>
    distinguish the notes of any one person. Deeper, more sonorous tones now
   </p>
   <p>
    issued from the revolving globes, sometimes resembling in character the
   </p>
   <p>
    vox humana of an organ, and every time they rose to a certain pitch
   </p>
   <p>
    there were responsive sounds--not certainly from any of the
   </p>
   <p>
    performers--low, tremulous, and Aeolian in character, wandering over the
   </p>
   <p>
    entire room, as if walls and ceiling were honey-combed with sensitive
   </p>
   <p>
    musical cells, answering to the deeper vibrations. These floating aerial
   </p>
   <p>
    sounds also answered to the higher notes of some of the female singers,
   </p>
   <p>
    resembling soprano voices, brightened and spiritualized in a wonderful
   </p>
   <p>
    degree; and then the wide room would be filled with a mist, as it were,
   </p>
   <p>
    of this floating, formless melody, which seemed to come from invisible
   </p>
   <p>
    harpers hovering in the shadows above.
   </p>
   <p>
    Lying back on my couch, listening with closed eyes to this mysterious,
   </p>
   <p>
    soul-stirring concert, I was affected to tears, and almost feared that I
   </p>
   <p>
    had been snatched away into some supra-mundane region inhabited by
   </p>
   <p>
    beings of an angelic or half-angelic order--feared, I say, for, with
   </p>
   <p>
    this new love in my heart, no elysium or starry abode could compare with
   </p>
   <p>
    this green earth for a dwellingplace. But when I remembered my own
   </p>
   <p>
    brutal bull of Bashan performance, my face, there in the dark, was on
   </p>
   <p>
    fire with shame; and I cursed the ignorant, presumptuous folly I had
   </p>
   <p>
    been guilty of in roaring out that abominable "Vicar of Bray" ballad,
   </p>
   <p>
    which had now become as hateful to me as my trousers or boots. The
   </p>
   <p>
    composer of that song, the writer of the words, and its subject, the
   </p>
   <p>
    double-faced Vicar himself, presented themselves to my mind as the three
   </p>
   <p>
    most damnable beings that had ever existed. "The devil take my luck!" I
   </p>
   <p>
    muttered, grinding my teeth with impotent anger; for it seemed such hard
   </p>
   <p>
    lines, just when I had succeeded in getting into favor, to go and spoil
   </p>
   <p>
    it all in that unhappy way. Now that I had become acquainted with their
   </p>
   <p>
    style of singing, the supposed fib, about which there had been such a
   </p>
   <p>
    pother, seemed a very venial offense compared with my attempt to lead
   </p>
   <p>
    the singing. Nevertheless, when the concert was over, not a word was
   </p>
   <p>
    said on the subject by any one, though I had quite expected to be taken
   </p>
   <p>
    at once to the magisterial chamber to hear some dreadful sentence passed
   </p>
   <p>
    on me; and when, before retiring, anxious to propitiate my host, I began
   </p>
   <p>
    to express regret for having inflicted pain on them by attempting to
   </p>
   <p>
    sing, the venerable gentleman raised his hands deprecatingly, and begged
   </p>
   <p>
    me to say no more about it, for painful subjects were best forgotten.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No doubt," he kindly added, "when you were lying there buried among the
   </p>
   <p>
    hills, you swallowed a large amount of earth and gravel in your efforts
   </p>
   <p>
    to breathe, and have not yet freed your lungs from it."
   </p>
   <p>
    This was the most charitable view he could take of the matter, and I was
   </p>
   <p>
    thankful that no worse result followed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 10
   </p>
   <p>
    At length the joyful day arrived when I was to cease, in outward
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance at all events, to be an alien; for returning at noon from the
   </p>
   <p>
    fields, on entering my cell I beheld my beautiful new garments--two
   </p>
   <p>
    complete suits, besides underwear: one, the most soberly colored,
   </p>
   <p>
    intended only for working hours; but the second, which was for the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, claimed my first attention. Trembling with eagerness, I flung off
   </p>
   <p>
    the old tweeds, the cracked boots, and other vestiges of a civilization
   </p>
   <p>
    which they had perhaps survived, and soon found that I had been measured
   </p>
   <p>
    with faultless accuracy; for everything, down to the shoes, fitted to
   </p>
   <p>
    perfection. Green was the prevailing or ground tint--a soft sap green;
   </p>
   <p>
    the pattern on it, which was very beautiful, being a somewhat obscure
   </p>
   <p>
    red, inclining to purple. My delight culminated when I drew on the hose,
   </p>
   <p>
    which had, like those worn by the others, a curious design, evidently
   </p>
   <p>
    borrowed from the skin of some kind of snake. The ground color was light
   </p>
   <p>
    green, almost citron yellow, in fact, and the pattern a bright maroon
   </p>
   <p>
    red, with bronze reflections.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had no sooner arrayed myself than, with a flushed face and palpitating
   </p>
   <p>
    heart, I flew to exhibit myself to my friends, and found them assembled
   </p>
   <p>
    and waiting to see and admire the result of their work. The pleasure I
   </p>
   <p>
    saw reflected in their transparent faces increased my happiness a
   </p>
   <p>
    hundredfold, and I quite astonished them with the torrent of eloquence
   </p>
   <p>
    in which I expressed my overflowing gratitude.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Now, tell me one secret," I exclaimed, when the excitement began to
   </p>
   <p>
    abate a little. "Why is green the principal color in my clothes, when no
   </p>
   <p>
    other person in the house wears more than a very little of it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I had no sooner spoken than I heartily wished that I had held my peace;
   </p>
   <p>
    for it all at once occurred to me that green was perhaps the color for
   </p>
   <p>
    an alien or mere hireling, in which light they perhaps regarded me.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, Smith, can you not guess so simple a thing?" said Edra, placing her
   </p>
   <p>
    white hands on my shoulders and smiling straight into my face.
   </p>
   <p>
    How beautiful she looked, standing there with her eyes so near to mine!
   </p>
   <p>
    "Tell me why, Edra?" I said, still with a lingering apprehension.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why, look at the color of my eyes and skin--would this green tint be
   </p>
   <p>
    suitable for me to wear?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, is that the reason!" cried I, immensely relieved. "I think, Edra,
   </p>
   <p>
    you would look very beautiful in any color that is on the earth, or in
   </p>
   <p>
    the rainbow above the earth. But am I so different from you all?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh yes, quite different--have you never looked at yourself? Your skin
   </p>
   <p>
    is whiter and redder, and your hair has a very different color. It will
   </p>
   <p>
    look better when it grows long, I think. And your eyes--do you know that
   </p>
   <p>
    they never change! for when we look at you closely they are still
   </p>
   <p>
    blue-gray, and not green."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No; I wish they were," said I. "Now I shall value my clothes a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    times more, since you have taken so much pains to make them--well, what
   </p>
   <p>
    shall I say?--harmonize, I suppose, with the peculiar color of my mug.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dash it all, I'm blundering again! I mean--I mean--don't you know----"
   </p>
   <p>
    Edra laughed and gave it up. Then we all laughed; for now evidently my
   </p>
   <p>
    blundering did not so much matter, since I had shed my outer integument,
   </p>
   <p>
    and come forth like a snake (with a divided tail) in a brand new skin.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently I missed Yoletta from the room, and desiring above all things
   </p>
   <p>
    to have some word of congratulation from her lips, I went off to seek
   </p>
   <p>
    her. She was standing under the portico waiting for me. "Come," she
   </p>
   <p>
    said, and proceeded to lead me into the music-room, where we sat down on
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the couches close to the dais; there she produced some large
   </p>
   <p>
    white tablets, and red chalk pencils or crayons.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Now, Smith, I am going to begin teaching you," said she, with the grave
   </p>
   <p>
    air of a young schoolmistress; "and every afternoon, when your work is
   </p>
   <p>
    done, you must come to me here."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I hope I am very stupid, and that it will take me a long time to
   </p>
   <p>
    learn," said I.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh"--she laughed--"do you think it will be so pleasant sitting by me
   </p>
   <p>
    here? I am glad you think that; but if you prefer me for a teacher you
   </p>
   <p>
    must not try to be stupid, because if you do I shall ask some one else
   </p>
   <p>
    to take my place."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Would you really do that, Yoletta?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes. Shall I tell you why? Because I have a quick, impatient temper.
   </p>
   <p>
    Everything wrong I have ever done, for which I have been punished, has
   </p>
   <p>
    been through my hasty temper."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And have you ever undergone that sad punishment of being shut up by
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself for many days, Yoletta?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, often; for what other punishment is there? But oh, I hope it will
   </p>
   <p>
    never happen again, because I think--I know that I suffer more than any
   </p>
   <p>
    one can imagine. To tread on the grass, to feel the sun and wind on my
   </p>
   <p>
    face, to see the earth and sky and animals--this is like life to me; and
   </p>
   <p>
    when I am shut up alone, every day seems--oh, a year at least!" She did
   </p>
   <p>
    not know how much dearer this confession of one little human weakness
   </p>
   <p>
    made her seem to me. "Come, let us begin," she said. "I waited for your
   </p>
   <p>
    new clothes to be finished, and we must make up for lost time."
   </p>
   <p>
    "But do you know, Yoletta, that you have not said anything about them?
   </p>
   <p>
    Do I look nice; and will you like me any better now?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, much better. You were a poor caterpillar before; I liked you a
   </p>
   <p>
    little because I knew what a pretty butterfly you would be in time. I
   </p>
   <p>
    helped to make your wings. Now, listen."
   </p>
   <p>
    For two hours she taught me, making her red letters or marks, which I
   </p>
   <p>
    copied on my tablet, and explaining them to me; and at the conclusion of
   </p>
   <p>
    the lesson, I had got a general idea that the writing was to a great
   </p>
   <p>
    extent phonographic, and that I was in for rather a tough job.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you think that you will be able to teach me to sing also?" I asked,
   </p>
   <p>
    when she had put the tablets aside.
   </p>
   <p>
    The memory of that miserable failure, when I "had led the singing," was
   </p>
   <p>
    a constant sore in my mind. I had begun to think that I had not done
   </p>
   <p>
    myself justice on that memorable occasion, and the desire to make
   </p>
   <p>
    another trial under more favorable circumstances was very strong in me.
   </p>
   <p>
    She looked a little startled at my question, but said nothing.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I know now," I continued pleadingly, "that you all sing softly. If you
   </p>
   <p>
    will only consent to try me once I promise to stick like cobbler's
   </p>
   <p>
    wax--I beg your pardon, I mean I will endeavor to adhere to the morendo
   </p>
   <p>
    and perdendosi style--don't you know? What am I saying! But I promise
   </p>
   <p>
    you, Yoletta, I shan't frighten you, if you will only let me try and
   </p>
   <p>
    sing to you once."
   </p>
   <p>
    She turned from me with a somewhat clouded expression of face, and
   </p>
   <p>
    walked with slow steps to the dais, and placing her hands on the keys,
   </p>
   <p>
    caused two of the small globes to revolve, sending soft waves of sound
   </p>
   <p>
    through the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    I advanced towards her, but she raised her hand apprehensively. "No, no,
   </p>
   <p>
    no; stand there," she said, "and sing low."
   </p>
   <p>
    It was hard to see her troubled face and obey, but I was not going to
   </p>
   <p>
    bellow at her like a bull, and I had set my heart on this trial. For the
   </p>
   <p>
    last three days, while working in the fields, I had been incessantly
   </p>
   <p>
    practicing my dear old master Campana's exquisite M'appar sulla
   </p>
   <p>
    tomba, the only melody I happened to know which had any resemblance
   </p>
   <p>
    to their divine music. To my surprise she seemed to play as I sang a
   </p>
   <p>
    suitable accompaniment on the globes, which aided and encouraged me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and, although singing in a subdued tone, I felt that I had never sung so
   </p>
   <p>
    well before. When I finished, I quite expected some word of praise, or
   </p>
   <p>
    to be asked why I had not sung this melody on that unhappy evening when
   </p>
   <p>
    I was asked to lead; but she spoke no word.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Will you sing something now?" I said.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Not now--this evening," she replied absently, slowly walking across the
   </p>
   <p>
    floor with eyes cast down.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What are you thinking of, Yoletta, that you look so serious?" I asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Nothing," she returned, a little impatiently.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You look very solemn about nothing, then. But you have not said one
   </p>
   <p>
    word about my singing--did you not like it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Your singing? Oh no! It was a pleasant-tasting little kernel in a very
   </p>
   <p>
    rough rind--I should like one without the other."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You talk in riddles, Yoletta; but I'm afraid the answers to them would
   </p>
   <p>
    not sound very flattering to me. But if you would like to know the song
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall be only too glad to teach it to you. The words are in Italian,
   </p>
   <p>
    but I can translate them."
   </p>
   <p>
    "The words?" she said absently.
   </p>
   <p>
    "The words of the song," I said.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I do not know what you mean by the words of a song. Do not speak to me
   </p>
   <p>
    now, Smith."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, very well," said I, thinking it all very strange, and sitting down
   </p>
   <p>
    I divided my attention between my beautiful hose and Yoletta, still
   </p>
   <p>
    slowly pacing the floor with that absent look on her face.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length the curious mood changed, but I did not venture to talk any
   </p>
   <p>
    more about music, and before very long we repaired to the eating-room,
   </p>
   <p>
    where, for the next two or three hours, we occupied ourselves very
   </p>
   <p>
    agreeably with those processes which, some new theorist informs us,
   </p>
   <p>
    constitute our chief pleasure in life.
   </p>
   <p>
    That evening I overheard a curious little dialogue. The father of the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, as I had now grown accustomed to call our head, after rising from
   </p>
   <p>
    his seat, stood for a few minutes talking near me, while Yoletta, with
   </p>
   <p>
    her hand on his arm, waited for him to finish. When he had done
   </p>
   <p>
    speaking, and turned to her, she said in a low voice, which I, however,
   </p>
   <p>
    overheard: "Father, I shall lead to-night."
   </p>
   <p>
    He put his hand on her head, and, looking down, studied her upturned
   </p>
   <p>
    face. "Ah, my daughter," he said with a smile, "shall I guess what has
   </p>
   <p>
    inspired you to-day? You have been listening to the passage birds. I
   </p>
   <p>
    also heard them this morning passing in flocks. And you have been
   </p>
   <p>
    following them in thought far away into those sun-bright lands where
   </p>
   <p>
    winter never comes."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, father," she returned, "I have only been a little way from home in
   </p>
   <p>
    thought--only to that spot where the grass has not yet grown to hide the
   </p>
   <p>
    ashes and loose mold." He stooped and kissed her forehead, and then left
   </p>
   <p>
    the room; and she, never noticing the hungry look with which I witnessed
   </p>
   <p>
    the tender caress, also went away.
   </p>
   <p>
    That some person was supposed to lead the singing every evening I knew,
   </p>
   <p>
    but it was impossible for me ever to discover who the leader was; now,
   </p>
   <p>
    however, after overhearing this conversation, I knew that on this
   </p>
   <p>
    particular occasion it would be Yoletta, and in spite of the very poor
   </p>
   <p>
    opinion she had expressed of my musical abilities, I was prepared to
   </p>
   <p>
    admire the performance more than I had ever done before.
   </p>
   <p>
    It commenced in the usual mysterious and indefinable manner; but after
   </p>
   <p>
    a time, when it began to shape itself into melodies, the idea possessed
   </p>
   <p>
    me that I was listening to strains once familiar, but long unheard and
   </p>
   <p>
    forgotten. At length I discovered that this was Campana's music, only
   </p>
   <p>
    not as I had ever heard it sung; for the melody of M'appar sulla
   </p>
   <p>
    tomba had been so transmuted and etherealized, as it were, that the
   </p>
   <p>
    composer himself would have listened in wondering ecstasy to the
   </p>
   <p>
    mournful strains, which had passed through the alembic of their more
   </p>
   <p>
    delicately organized minds. Listening, I remembered with an
   </p>
   <p>
    unaccountable feeling of sadness, that poor Campana had recently died in
   </p>
   <p>
    London; and almost at the same moment there came to me a remembrance of
   </p>
   <p>
    my beloved mother, whose early death was my first great grief in
   </p>
   <p>
    boyhood. All the songs I had ever heard her sing came back to me,
   </p>
   <p>
    ringing in my mind with a wonderful joy, but ever ending in a strange,
   </p>
   <p>
    funereal sadness. And not only my mother, but many a dear one besides
   </p>
   <p>
    returned "in beauty from the dust" appeared to be present--white-haired
   </p>
   <p>
    old men who had spoken treasured words to me in bygone years;
   </p>
   <p>
    schoolfellows and other boyish friends and companions; and men, too, in
   </p>
   <p>
    the prime of life, of whose premature death in this or that far-off
   </p>
   <p>
    region of the world-wide English empire I had heard from time to time.
   </p>
   <p>
    They came back to me, until the whole room seemed filled with a pale,
   </p>
   <p>
    shadowy procession, moving past me to the sound of that mysterious
   </p>
   <p>
    melody. Through all the evening it came back, in a hundred bewildering
   </p>
   <p>
    disguises, filling me with a melancholy infinitely precious, which was
   </p>
   <p>
    yet almost more than my heart could bear. Again and yet again that
   </p>
   <p>
    despairing Ah-i-me fell like a long shuddering sob from the
   </p>
   <p>
    revolving globes, and from voices far and near, to be taken up and borne
   </p>
   <p>
    yet further away by far-off, dying sounds, yet again responded to by
   </p>
   <p>
    nearer, clearer voices, in tones which seemed wrung "from the depths of
   </p>
   <p>
    some divine despair"; then to pass away, but not wholly pass, for all
   </p>
   <p>
    the hidden cells were stirred, and the vibrating air, like mysterious,
   </p>
   <p>
    invisible hands, swept the suspended strings, until the exquisite bliss
   </p>
   <p>
    and pain of it made me tremble and shed tears, as I sat there in the
   </p>
   <p>
    dark, wondering, as men will wonder at such moments, what this tempest
   </p>
   <p>
    of the soul which music wakes in us can mean: whether it is merely a
   </p>
   <p>
    growth of this our earth-life, or a something added, a divine hunger of
   </p>
   <p>
    the heart which is part of our immortality.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 11
   </p>
   <p>
    It seemed to me now that I had never really lived before so sweet was
   </p>
   <p>
    this new life--so healthy, and free from care and regret. The old life,
   </p>
   <p>
    which I had lived in cities, was less in my thoughts on each succeeding
   </p>
   <p>
    day; it came to me now like the memory of a repulsive dream, which I was
   </p>
   <p>
    only too glad to forget. How I had ever found that listless, worn-out,
   </p>
   <p>
    luxurious, do-nothing existence endurable, seemed a greater mystery
   </p>
   <p>
    every morning, when I went forth to my appointed task in the fields or
   </p>
   <p>
    the workhouse, so natural and so pleasant did it now seem to labor with
   </p>
   <p>
    my own hands, and to eat my bread in the sweat of my face. If there was
   </p>
   <p>
    one kind of work I preferred above all others, it was wood-cutting, and
   </p>
   <p>
    as a great deal of timber was required at this season, I was allowed to
   </p>
   <p>
    follow my own inclination. In the forest, a couple of miles from the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, several tough old giants--chiefly oak, chestnut, elm, and
   </p>
   <p>
    beech--had been marked out for destruction: in some cases because they
   </p>
   <p>
    had been scorched and riven by lightnings, and were an eyesore; in
   </p>
   <p>
    others, because time had robbed them of their glory, withering their
   </p>
   <p>
    long, desolate arms, and bestowing on their crowns that lusterless,
   </p>
   <p>
    scanty foliage which has a mournful meaning, like the thin white hairs
   </p>
   <p>
    on the bowed head of a very old man. At this distance from the house I
   </p>
   <p>
    could freely indulge my propensity for singing, albeit in that coarser
   </p>
   <p>
    tone which had failed to win favor with my new friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    Among the grand trees, out of earshot of them all, I could shout aloud
   </p>
   <p>
    to my heart's content, rejoicing in the boisterous old English ballads,
   </p>
   <p>
    which, like John Peele's view-hallo,
   </p>
   <p>
    "Might awaken the dead
   </p>
   <p>
    Or the fox from his lair in the morning."
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile, with the frantic energy of a Gladstone out of office, I plied
   </p>
   <p>
    my ax, its echoing strokes making fit accompaniment to my strains, until
   </p>
   <p>
    for many yards about me the ground was littered with white and yellow
   </p>
   <p>
    chips; then, exhausted with my efforts, I would sit down to rest and eat
   </p>
   <p>
    my simple midday fare, to admire myself in my deep-green and chocolate
   </p>
   <p>
    working-dress, and, above everything, to think and dream of Yoletta.
   </p>
   <p>
    * * * * *
   </p>
   <p>
    In my walks to and from the forest I cast many a wistful look at a
   </p>
   <p>
    solitary flat-topped hill, almost a mountain in height, which stood two
   </p>
   <p>
    or three miles from the house, north of it, on the other side of the
   </p>
   <p>
    river. From its summit I felt sure that a very extensive view of the
   </p>
   <p>
    surrounding country might be had, and I often wished to pay this hill a
   </p>
   <p>
    visit. One afternoon, while taking my lesson in reading, I mentioned
   </p>
   <p>
    this desire to Yoletta.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Come, then, let us go there now," said she, laying the tablets aside.
   </p>
   <p>
    I joyfully agreed: I had never walked alone with her, nor, in fact, with
   </p>
   <p>
    her at all, since that first day when she had placed her hand in mine;
   </p>
   <p>
    and now we were so much nearer in heart to each other.
   </p>
   <p>
    She led me to a point, half a mile from the house, where the stream
   </p>
   <p>
    rushed noisily over its stony bed and formed numerous deep channels
   </p>
   <p>
    between the rocks, and one could cross over by jumping from rock to
   </p>
   <p>
    rock. Yoletta led the way, leaping airily from stone to stone, while I,
   </p>
   <p>
    anxious to escape a wetting, followed her with caution; but when I was
   </p>
   <p>
    safe over, and thought our delightful walk was about to begin, she
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly started off towards the hill at a swift pace, which quickly
   </p>
   <p>
    left me far behind. Finding that I could not overtake her, I shouted to
   </p>
   <p>
    her to wait for me; then she stood still until I was within three or
   </p>
   <p>
    four yards Of her, when off she fled like the wind once more. At length
   </p>
   <p>
    she reached the foot of the hill, and sat down there until I joined her.
   </p>
   <p>
    "For goodness sake, Yoletta, let us behave like rational beings and walk
   </p>
   <p>
    quietly," I was beginning, when away she went again, dancing up the
   </p>
   <p>
    mountain-side with a tireless energy that amazed as well as exasperated
   </p>
   <p>
    me. "Wait for me just once more," I screamed after her; then, half-way
   </p>
   <p>
    up the side, she stopped and sat down on a stone.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Now my chance has come," thought I, ready to make up for insufficient
   </p>
   <p>
    speed and wind by superior cunning, which would make us equal. "I will
   </p>
   <p>
    go quietly up and catch her napping, and hold her fast by the arm until
   </p>
   <p>
    the walk is finished. So far it has been nothing but a mad chase."
   </p>
   <p>
    Slowly I toiled on, and then, when I got near her and was just about to
   </p>
   <p>
    execute my plan, she started nimbly away, with a merry laugh, and never
   </p>
   <p>
    paused again until the summit was reached. Thoroughly tired and beaten,
   </p>
   <p>
    I sat down to rest; but presently looking up I saw her at the top,
   </p>
   <p>
    standing motionless on a stone, looking like a statue outlined against
   </p>
   <p>
    the clear blue sky. Once more I got up and pressed on until I reached
   </p>
   <p>
    her, and then sank down on the grass, overcome with fatigue.
   </p>
   <p>
    "When you ask me to walk again, Yoletta," I panted, "I shall not move
   </p>
   <p>
    unless I have a rope round your waist to pull you back when you try to
   </p>
   <p>
    rush off in that mad fashion. You have knocked all the wind out of me;
   </p>
   <p>
    and yet I was in pretty good trim."
   </p>
   <p>
    She laughed, and jumping to the ground, sat down at my side on the
   </p>
   <p>
    grass.
   </p>
   <p>
    I caught her hand and held it tight. "Now you shall not escape and run
   </p>
   <p>
    away again," said I.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You may keep my hand," she replied; "it has nothing to do up here."
   </p>
   <p>
    "May I put it to some useful purpose--may I do what I like with it?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, you may," then she added with a smile: "There is no thorn in it
   </p>
   <p>
    now."
   </p>
   <p>
    I kissed it many times on the back, the palm, the wrist then bestowed a
   </p>
   <p>
    separate caress on each finger-tip.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why do you kiss my hand?" she asked.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you not know--can you not guess? Because it is the sweetest thing I
   </p>
   <p>
    can kiss, except one other thing. Shall I tell you----"
   </p>
   <p>
    "My face? And why do you not kiss that?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, may I?" said I, and drawing her to me I kissed her soft cheek. "May
   </p>
   <p>
    I kiss the other cheek now?" I asked. She turned it to me, and when I
   </p>
   <p>
    had kissed it rapturously, I gazed into her eyes, which looked back,
   </p>
   <p>
    bright and unabashed, into mine. "I think--I think I made a slight
   </p>
   <p>
    mistake, Yoletta," I said. "What I meant to ask was, will you let me
   </p>
   <p>
    kiss you where I like--on your chin, for instance, or just where I
   </p>
   <p>
    like?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes; but you are keeping me too long. Kiss me as many times as you
   </p>
   <p>
    like, and then let us admire the prospect."
   </p>
   <p>
    I drew her closer and kissed her mouth, not once nor twice, but clinging
   </p>
   <p>
    to it with all the ardor of passion, as if my lips had become glued to
   </p>
   <p>
    hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly she disengaged herself from me. "Why do you kiss my mouth in
   </p>
   <p>
    that violent way?" she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling, her cheeks
   </p>
   <p>
    flushed. "You seem like some hungry animal that wanted to devour me."
   </p>
   <p>
    That was, oddly enough, just how I felt. "Do you not not know, sweetest,
   </p>
   <p>
    why I kiss you in that way? Because I love you."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I know you do, Smith. I can understand and appreciate your love without
   </p>
   <p>
    having my lips bruised."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And do you love me, Yoletta?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, certainly--did you not know that?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "And is it not sweet to kiss when you love? Do you know what love is,
   </p>
   <p>
    darling? Do you love me a thousand times more than any one else in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "How extravagantly you talk!" she replied. "What strange things you
   </p>
   <p>
    say!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, dear, because love is strange--the strangest, sweetest thing in
   </p>
   <p>
    life. It comes once only to the heart, and the one person loved is
   </p>
   <p>
    infinitely more than all others. Do you not understand that?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh no; what do you mean, Smith?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Is there any other person dearer to your heart than I am?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I love every one in the house, some more than others. Those that are
   </p>
   <p>
    closely related to me I love most."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, please say no more! You love your people with one kind of love, but
   </p>
   <p>
    me with a different love--is it not so?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "There is only one kind of love," said she.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Ah, you say that because you are a child yet, and do not know. You are
   </p>
   <p>
    even younger than I thought, perhaps. How old are you, dear?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Thirty-one years old," she replied, with the utmost gravity.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, Yoletta, what an awful cram! I mean--oh, I beg your pardon for
   </p>
   <p>
    being so rude! But--but don't you think you can draw it mild?
   </p>
   <p>
    Thirty-one--what a joke! Why, I'm an old fellow compared with you, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm not twenty-two yet. Do tell me what you mean, Yoletta?"
   </p>
   <p>
    She was not listening to me, I saw: she had risen from the grass and
   </p>
   <p>
    seated herself again on the stone. For only answer to my question she
   </p>
   <p>
    pointed to the west with her hand, saying: "Look there, Smith."
   </p>
   <p>
    I stood up and looked. The sun was near the horizon now, and partially
   </p>
   <p>
    concealed by low clouds, which were beginning to form--gray, and tinged
   </p>
   <p>
    with purple and red; but their misty edges burned with an intense yellow
   </p>
   <p>
    flame. Above, the sky was clear as blue glass, barred with pale-yellow
   </p>
   <p>
    rays, shot forth by the sinking sun, and resembling the spokes of an
   </p>
   <p>
    immense celestial wheel reaching to the zenith. The billowy earth, with
   </p>
   <p>
    its forests in deep green and many-colored, autumnal foliage, stretched
   </p>
   <p>
    far before us, here in shadow, and there flushed with rich light; while
   </p>
   <p>
    the mountain range, looming near and stupendous on our right, had
   </p>
   <p>
    changed its color from dark blue to violet.
   </p>
   <p>
    The doubts and fears agitating my heart made me indifferent to the
   </p>
   <p>
    surpassing beauty of the scene: I turned impatiently from it to gaze
   </p>
   <p>
    again on her graceful figure, girlish still in its slim proportions; but
   </p>
   <p>
    her face, flushed with sunlight, and crowned with its dark, shining
   </p>
   <p>
    hair, seemed to me like the face of one of the immortals. The expression
   </p>
   <p>
    of rapt devotion on it made me silent, for it seemed as if she too had
   </p>
   <p>
    been touched by nature's magic, like earth and sky, and been
   </p>
   <p>
    transfigured; and waiting for the mood to pass, I stood by her side,
   </p>
   <p>
    resting my hand on her knee. By-and-by she looked down and smiled, and
   </p>
   <p>
    then I returned to the subject of her age.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Surely, Yoletta," said I, "you were only poking fun at me--I mean,
   </p>
   <p>
    amusing yourself at my expense. You can't possibly be more than about
   </p>
   <p>
    fifteen, or sixteen at the very outside."
   </p>
   <p>
    She smiled again and shook her head.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, I know, I can solve the riddle now. Your years are different, of
   </p>
   <p>
    course, like everything else in this latitude. A month is called a year
   </p>
   <p>
    with you, and that would make you, let me see--how much is twelve times
   </p>
   <p>
    thirty-one? Oh, hang it, nearly five hundred, I should think. Why am I
   </p>
   <p>
    such a duffer at mental arithmetic! It is just the contrary--how many
   </p>
   <p>
    twelves in thirty-one? About two and a half in round numbers, and that's
   </p>
   <p>
    absurd, as you are not a baby. Oh, I have it: your seasons are called
   </p>
   <p>
    years, of course--why didn't I see it before! No, that would make you
   </p>
   <p>
    only seven and a half. Ah, yes, I see it now: a year means two years, or
   </p>
   <p>
    two of your years--summer and winter--mean a year; and that just makes
   </p>
   <p>
    you sixteen, exactly what I had imagined. Is it not so, Yoletta?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I do not know what you are talking about, Smith; and I am not
   </p>
   <p>
    listening."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, listen for one moment, and tell me how long does a year last?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "It lasts from the time the leaves fall in the autumn until they fall
   </p>
   <p>
    again; and it lasts from the time the swallows come in spring until they
   </p>
   <p>
    come again."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And seriously, honestly, you are thirty-one years old?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Did I not tell you so? Yes, I am thirty-one years old."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Well, I never heard anything to equal this! Good heavens, what does it
   </p>
   <p>
    mean? I know it is awfully rude to inquire a lady's age, but what am I
   </p>
   <p>
    to do? Will you kindly tell me Edra's age?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Edra? I forget. Oh yes; she is sixty-three."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Sixty-three! I'll be shot if she's a day more than twenty-eight! Idiot
   </p>
   <p>
    that I am, why can't I keep calm! But, Yoletta, how you distress me! It
   </p>
   <p>
    almost frightens me to ask another question, but do tell me how old your
   </p>
   <p>
    father is?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "He is nearly two hundred years old--a hundred and ninety-eight, I
   </p>
   <p>
    think," she replied.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Heavens on earth--I shall go stark, staring mad!" But I could say no
   </p>
   <p>
    more; leaving her side I sat down on a low stone at some distance, with
   </p>
   <p>
    a stunned feeling in my brain, and something like despair in my heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    That she had told me the truth I could no longer doubt for one moment:
   </p>
   <p>
    it was impossible for her crystal nature to be anything but truthful.
   </p>
   <p>
    The number of her years mattered nothing to me; the virgin sweetness of
   </p>
   <p>
    girlhood was on her lips, the freshness and glory of early youth on her
   </p>
   <p>
    forehead; the misery was that she had lived thirty-one years in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world and did not understand the words I had spoken to her--did not know
   </p>
   <p>
    what love, or passion, was! Would it always be so--would my heart
   </p>
   <p>
    consume itself to ashes, and kindle no fire in hers?
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, as I sat there, filled with these despairing thoughts, she came
   </p>
   <p>
    down from her perch, and, dropping on her knees before me, put her arms
   </p>
   <p>
    about my neck and gazed steadily into my face. "Why are you troubled,
   </p>
   <p>
    Smith-have I said anything to hurt you?" said she. "And do you not know
   </p>
   <p>
    that you have offended me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Have I? Tell me how, dearest Yoletta."
   </p>
   <p>
    "By asking questions, and saying wild, meaningless things while I sat
   </p>
   <p>
    there watching the setting sun. It troubled me and spoiled my pleasure;
   </p>
   <p>
    but I will forgive you, Smith, because I love you. Do you not think I
   </p>
   <p>
    love you enough? You are very dear to me--dearer every day." And drawing
   </p>
   <p>
    down my face she kissed my lips.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Darling, you make me happy again," I returned, "for if your love
   </p>
   <p>
    increases every day, the time will perhaps come when you will understand
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and be all I wish to me."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What is it that you wish?" she questioned.
   </p>
   <p>
    "That you should be mine--mine alone, wholly mine--and give yourself to
   </p>
   <p>
    me, body and soul."
   </p>
   <p>
    She continued gazing up into my eyes. "In a sense we do, I suppose, give
   </p>
   <p>
    ourselves, body and soul, to those we love," she said. "And if you are
   </p>
   <p>
    not yet satisfied that I have given myself to you in that way, you must
   </p>
   <p>
    wait patiently, saying and doing nothing willfully to alienate my heart,
   </p>
   <p>
    until the time arrives when my love will be equal to your desire. Come,"
   </p>
   <p>
    she added, and, rising, pulled me up by the hand.
   </p>
   <p>
    Silently, and somewhat pensively, we started hand in hand on our walk
   </p>
   <p>
    down the hill. Presently she dropped on her knees, and opening the grass
   </p>
   <p>
    with her hands, displayed a small, slender bud, on a round, smooth stem,
   </p>
   <p>
    springing without leaves from the soil. "Do you see!" she said, looking
   </p>
   <p>
    up at me with a bright smile.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, dear, I see a bud; but I do not know anything more about it."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, Smith, do you not know that it is a rainbow lily!" And rising, she
   </p>
   <p>
    took my hand and walked on again.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What is the rainbow lily?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "By-and-by, in a few days, it will be in fullest bloom, and the earth
   </p>
   <p>
    will be covered with its glory."
   </p>
   <p>
    "It is so late in the season, Yoletta! Spring is the time to see the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth covered with the glory of flowers."
   </p>
   <p>
    "There is nothing to equal the rainbow lily, which comes when most
   </p>
   <p>
    flowers are dead, or have their bright colors tarnished. Have you lived
   </p>
   <p>
    in the moon, Smith, that I have to tell you these things?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, dear, but in that island where all things, including flowers, were
   </p>
   <p>
    different."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Ah, yes; tell me about the island."
   </p>
   <p>
    Now "that island" was an unfortunate subject, and I was not prepared to
   </p>
   <p>
    break the resolution I had made of prudently holding my tongue about its
   </p>
   <p>
    peculiar institutions. "How can I tell you?--how could you imagine it if
   </p>
   <p>
    I were to tell you?" I said, evading the question. "You have seen the
   </p>
   <p>
    heavens black with tempests, and have felt the lightnings blinding your
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes, and have heard the crash of the thunder: could you imagine all
   </p>
   <p>
    that if you had never witnessed it, and I described it to you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Then it would be useless to tell you. And now tell me about the rainbow
   </p>
   <p>
    lilies, for I am a great lover of flowers."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Are you? Is it strange you should have a taste common to all human
   </p>
   <p>
    beings?" she returned with a pretty smile. "But it is easier to ask
   </p>
   <p>
    questions than to answer them. If you had never seen the sun setting in
   </p>
   <p>
    glory, or the midnight sky shining with myriads of stars, could you
   </p>
   <p>
    imagine these things if I described them to you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No."
   </p>
   <p>
    "That word is an echo, Smith. You must wait for the earth to bring forth
   </p>
   <p>
    her rainbow lilies, and the heart its love."
   </p>
   <p>
    "With or without flowers, the world is a paradise to me, with you at my
   </p>
   <p>
    side, Yoletta. Ah, if you will be my Eve! How sweet it is to walk hand
   </p>
   <p>
    in hand with you in the twilight; but it was not so nice when you were
   </p>
   <p>
    scuttling from me like a wild rabbit. I'm glad to find that you do walk
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, sometimes--on solemn occasions."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes? Tell me about these solemn occasions."
   </p>
   <p>
    "This is not one of them," she replied, suddenly withdrawing her hand
   </p>
   <p>
    from mine; then with a ringing laugh, she sped from me, bounding down
   </p>
   <p>
    the hill-side with the speed and grace of a gazelle.
   </p>
   <p>
    I instantly gave chase; but it was a very vain chase, although I put
   </p>
   <p>
    forth all my powers. Occasionally she would drop on her knees to admire
   </p>
   <p>
    some wild flower, or search for a lily bud; and whenever she came to a
   </p>
   <p>
    large stone, she would spring on to it, and stand for some time
   </p>
   <p>
    motionless, gazing at the rich hues of the afterglow; but always at my
   </p>
   <p>
    approach she would spring lightly away, escaping from me as easily as a
   </p>
   <p>
    wild bird. Tired with running, I at last gave up the hunt, and walked
   </p>
   <p>
    soberly home by myself, wondering whether that conversation on the
   </p>
   <p>
    summit of the hill, and all the curious information I had gathered from
   </p>
   <p>
    it, should make me the most miserable or the most happy being upon
   </p>
   <p>
    earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 12
   </p>
   <p>
    The question whether I had reason to feel happy or the reverse still
   </p>
   <p>
    occupied me after going to bed, and kept me awake far into the night. I
   </p>
   <p>
    put it to myself in a variety of ways, concentrating my faculties on it;
   </p>
   <p>
    but the result still remained doubtful. Mine was a curious position for
   </p>
   <p>
    a man to be in; for here was I, very much in love with Yoletta, who said
   </p>
   <p>
    that her age was thirty-one, and yet who knew of only one kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    love--that sisterly affection which she gave me so unstintingly. Of
   </p>
   <p>
    course I was surrounded with mysteries, being in the house but not of
   </p>
   <p>
    it, to the manner born; and I had already arrived at the conclusion that
   </p>
   <p>
    these mysteries could only be known to me through reading, once that
   </p>
   <p>
    accomplishment was mine. For it seemed rather a dangerous thing to ask
   </p>
   <p>
    questions, since the most innocent interrogatory might be taken as an
   </p>
   <p>
    offense, only to be expiated by solitary confinement and a
   </p>
   <p>
    bread-and-water diet; or, if not punishable in that way, it would
   </p>
   <p>
    probably be regarded as a result of the supposed collision of my head
   </p>
   <p>
    with a stone. To be reticent, observant, and studious was a safe plan;
   </p>
   <p>
    this had served to make me diligent and attentive with my lessons, and
   </p>
   <p>
    my gentle teacher had been much pleased with the progress I had made,
   </p>
   <p>
    even in a few days. Her words on the hill had now, however, filled me
   </p>
   <p>
    with anxiety, and I wanted to go a little below the surface of this
   </p>
   <p>
    strange system of life. Why was this large family--twenty-two members
   </p>
   <p>
    present, besides some absent pilgrims, as they are called--composed only
   </p>
   <p>
    of adults? Again, more curious still, why was the father of the house
   </p>
   <p>
    adorned with a majestic beard, while the other men, of various ages, had
   </p>
   <p>
    smooth faces, or, at any rate, nothing more than a slight down on the
   </p>
   <p>
    upper lip and cheeks? It was plain that they never shaved. And were
   </p>
   <p>
    these people all really brothers and sisters? So far, I had been unable,
   </p>
   <p>
    even with the most jealous watching, to detect anything like love-making
   </p>
   <p>
    or flirting; they all treated each other, as Yoletta treated me, with
   </p>
   <p>
    kindness and affection, and nothing more. And if the head of the house
   </p>
   <p>
    was in fact the father of them all--since in two centuries a man might
   </p>
   <p>
    have an indefinite number of children--who was the mother or mothers? I
   </p>
   <p>
    was never good at guessing, but the result of my cogitations was one
   </p>
   <p>
    happy idea--to ask Yoletta whether she had a living mother or not? She
   </p>
   <p>
    was my teacher, my friend and guardian in the house, and if it should
   </p>
   <p>
    turn out that the question was an unfortunate one, an offense, she would
   </p>
   <p>
    be readier to forgive than another.
   </p>
   <p>
    Accordingly, next day, as soon as we were alone together I put the
   </p>
   <p>
    question to her, although not without a nervous qualm.
   </p>
   <p>
    She looked at me with the greatest surprise. "Do you mean to say," she
   </p>
   <p>
    answered, "that you do not know I have a mother--that there is a mother
   </p>
   <p>
    of the house?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "How should I know, Yoletta?" I returned. "I have not heard you address
   </p>
   <p>
    any one as mother; besides, how is one to know anything in a strange
   </p>
   <p>
    place unless he is told?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "How strange, then, that you never asked till now! There is a mother of
   </p>
   <p>
    the house--the mother of us all, of you since you were made one of us;
   </p>
   <p>
    and it happens, too, that I am her daughter--her only child. You have
   </p>
   <p>
    not seen her because you have never asked to be taken to her; and she is
   </p>
   <p>
    not among us because of her illness. For very long she has been
   </p>
   <p>
    afflicted with a malady from which she cannot recover, and for a whole
   </p>
   <p>
    year she has not left the Mother's Room."
   </p>
   <p>
    She spoke with eyes cast down, in a low and very sad voice. It was only
   </p>
   <p>
    too plain now that in my ignorance I had been guilty of a grave breach
   </p>
   <p>
    of the etiquette or laws of the house; and anxious to repair my fault,
   </p>
   <p>
    also to know more of the one female in this mysterious community who had
   </p>
   <p>
    loved, or at all events had known marriage, I asked if I might see her.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes," she answered, after some hesitation, still standing with eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    cast down. Then suddenly, bursting into tears, she exclaimed: "Oh,
   </p>
   <p>
    Smith, how could you be in the world and not know that there is a mother
   </p>
   <p>
    in every house! How could you travel and not know that when you enter a
   </p>
   <p>
    house, after greeting the father, you first of all ask to be taken to
   </p>
   <p>
    the mother to worship her and feel her hand on your head? Did you not
   </p>
   <p>
    see that we were astonished and grieved at your silence when you came,
   </p>
   <p>
    and we waited in vain for you to speak?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I was dumb with shame at her words. How well I remembered that first
   </p>
   <p>
    evening in the house, when I could not but see that something was
   </p>
   <p>
    expected of me, yet never ventured to ask for enlightment!
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently, recovering from her tears, she went from the room, and, left
   </p>
   <p>
    alone, I was more than ever filled with wonder at what she had told me.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had not imagined that she had come into the world without a mother;
   </p>
   <p>
    nevertheless, the fact that this passionless girl, who had told me that
   </p>
   <p>
    there was only one kind of love, was the daughter of a woman actually
   </p>
   <p>
    living in the house, of whose existence I had never before heard, except
   </p>
   <p>
    in an indirect way which I failed to understand, seemed like a dream to
   </p>
   <p>
    me. Now I was about to see this hidden woman, and the interview would
   </p>
   <p>
    reveal something to me, for I would discover in her face and
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation whether she was in the same mystic state of mind as the
   </p>
   <p>
    others, which made them seem like the dwellers in some better place than
   </p>
   <p>
    this poor old sinful, sorrowful world. My wishes, however, were not to
   </p>
   <p>
    be gratified, for presently Yoletta returned and said that her mother
   </p>
   <p>
    did not desire to see me then. She looked so distressed when she told me
   </p>
   <p>
    this, putting her white arms about my neck as if to console me for my
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointment, that I refrained from pressing her with questions, and
   </p>
   <p>
    for several days nothing more was spoken between us on the subject.
   </p>
   <p>
    At length, one day when our lesson was over, with an expression of
   </p>
   <p>
    mingled pleasure and anxiety on her face, she rose and took my hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    saying, "Come."
   </p>
   <p>
    I knew she was going to take me to her mother, and rose to obey her
   </p>
   <p>
    gladly, for since the conversation I had had with her the desire to know
   </p>
   <p>
    the lady of the house had given me no peace.
   </p>
   <p>
    Leaving the music room, we entered another apartment, of the same
   </p>
   <p>
    nave-like form, but vaster, or, at all events, considerably longer.
   </p>
   <p>
    There I started and stood still, amazed at the scene before me. The
   </p>
   <p>
    light, which found entrance through tall, narrow windows, was dim, but
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficient to show the whole room with everything in it, ending at the
   </p>
   <p>
    further extremity at a flight of broad stone steps. The middle part of
   </p>
   <p>
    the floor, running the entire length of the apartment, was about twenty
   </p>
   <p>
    feet wide, but on either side of this passage, which was covered with
   </p>
   <p>
    mosaic, the floor was raised; and on this higher level I saw, as I
   </p>
   <p>
    imagined, a great company of men and women, singly and in groups,
   </p>
   <p>
    standing or seated on great stone chairs in various positions and
   </p>
   <p>
    attitudes. Presently I perceived that these were not living beings, but
   </p>
   <p>
    life-like effigies of stone, the drapery they were represented as
   </p>
   <p>
    wearing being of many different richly-colored stones, having the
   </p>
   <p>
    appearance of real garments. So natural did the hair look, that only
   </p>
   <p>
    when I ascended the steps and touched the head of one of the statues was
   </p>
   <p>
    I convinced that it was also of stone. Even more wonderful in their
   </p>
   <p>
    resemblance to life were the eyes, which seemed to return my
   </p>
   <p>
    half-fearful glances with a calm, questioning scrutiny I found it hard
   </p>
   <p>
    to endure. I hurried on after my guide without speaking, but when I got
   </p>
   <p>
    to the middle of the room I paused involuntarily once more, so
   </p>
   <p>
    profoundly did one of the statues impress me. It was of a woman of a
   </p>
   <p>
    majestic figure and proud, beautiful face, with an abundance of
   </p>
   <p>
    silvery-white hair. She sat bending forward with her eyes fixed on mine
   </p>
   <p>
    as I advanced, one hand pressed to her bosom, while with the other she
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed in the act of throwing back her white unbound tresses from her
   </p>
   <p>
    forehead. There was, I thought, a look of calm, unbending pride on the
   </p>
   <p>
    face, but on coming closer this expression disappeared, giving place to
   </p>
   <p>
    one so wistful and pleading, so charged with subtle pain, that I stood
   </p>
   <p>
    gazing like one fascinated, until Yoletta took my hand and gently drew
   </p>
   <p>
    me away. Still, in spite of the absorbing nature of the matter on which
   </p>
   <p>
    I was bound, that strange face continued to haunt me, and glancing up
   </p>
   <p>
    and down through that long array of calm-browed, beautiful women, I
   </p>
   <p>
    could see no one that was like it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Arrived at the end of the gallery, we ascended the broad stone steps,
   </p>
   <p>
    and came to a landing twenty or thirty feet above the level of the floor
   </p>
   <p>
    we had traversed. Here Yoletta pushed a glass door aside and ushered me
   </p>
   <p>
    into another apartment--the Mother's Room. It was spacious, and, unlike
   </p>
   <p>
    the gallery, well-lighted; the air in it was also warm and balmy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed charged with a subtle aroma. But now my whole attention was
   </p>
   <p>
    concentrated on a group of persons before me, and chiefly on its central
   </p>
   <p>
    figure--the woman I had so much desired to see. She was seated, leaning
   </p>
   <p>
    back in a somewhat listless attitude, on a very large, low, couch-like
   </p>
   <p>
    seat, covered with a soft, violet-colored material. My very first glance
   </p>
   <p>
    at her face revealed to me that she differed in appearance and
   </p>
   <p>
    expression from other inmates of the house: one reason was that she was
   </p>
   <p>
    extremely pale, and bore on her worn countenance the impress of
   </p>
   <p>
    long-continued suffering; but that was not all. She wore her hair, which
   </p>
   <p>
    fell unbound on her shoulders, longer than the others, and her eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    looked larger, and of a deeper green. There was something wonderfully
   </p>
   <p>
    fascinating to me in that pale, suffering face, for, in spite of
   </p>
   <p>
    suffering, it was beautiful and loving; but dearer than all these things
   </p>
   <p>
    to my mind were the marks of passion it exhibited, the petulant, almost
   </p>
   <p>
    scornful mouth, and the half-eager, half-weary expression of the eyes,
   </p>
   <p>
    for these seemed rather to belong to that imperfect world from which I
   </p>
   <p>
    had been severed, and which was still dear to my unregenerate heart. In
   </p>
   <p>
    other respects also she differed from the rest of the women, her dress
   </p>
   <p>
    being a long, pale-blue robe, embroidered with saffron-colored flowers
   </p>
   <p>
    and foliage down the middle, and also on the neck and the wide sleeves.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the couch at her side sat the father of the house, holding her hand
   </p>
   <p>
    and talking in low tones to her; two of the young women sat at her feet
   </p>
   <p>
    on cushions, engaged on embroidery work, while another stood behind her;
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the young men was also there, and was just now showing her a
   </p>
   <p>
    sketch, and apparently explaining something in it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had expected to find a sick, feeble lady, in a dimly-lighted chamber,
   </p>
   <p>
    with perhaps one attendant at her side; now, coming so unexpectedly
   </p>
   <p>
    before this proud-looking, beautiful woman, with so many about her, I
   </p>
   <p>
    was completely abashed, and, feeling too confused to say anything, stood
   </p>
   <p>
    silent and awkward in her presence.
   </p>
   <p>
    "This is our stranger, Chastel," said the old man to her, at the same
   </p>
   <p>
    time bestowing an encouraging look on me.
   </p>
   <p>
    She turned from the sketch she had been studying, and raising herself
   </p>
   <p>
    slightly from her half-recumbent attitude, fixed her dark eyes on me
   </p>
   <p>
    with some interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I do not see why you were so much impressed," she remarked after a
   </p>
   <p>
    while. "There is nothing very strange in him after all."
   </p>
   <p>
    I felt my face grow hot with shame and anger, for she seemed to look on
   </p>
   <p>
    me and speak of me--not to me--as if I had been some strange, semi-human
   </p>
   <p>
    creature, discovered in the woods, and brought in as a great curiosity.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No; it was not his countenance, only his curious garments and his words
   </p>
   <p>
    that astonished us," said the father in reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    She made no answer to this, but presently, addressing me directly, said:
   </p>
   <p>
    "You were a long time in the house before you expressed a wish to see
   </p>
   <p>
    me."
   </p>
   <p>
    I found my speech then--a wretched, hesitating speech, for which I hated
   </p>
   <p>
    myself--and replied, that I had asked to be allowed to see her as soon
   </p>
   <p>
    as I had been informed of her existence.
   </p>
   <p>
    She turned on the father a look of surprise and inquiry.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You must remember, Chastel," said he, "that he comes to us from some
   </p>
   <p>
    strange, distant island, having customs different from ours--a thing I
   </p>
   <p>
    had never heard of before. I can give you no other explanation."
   </p>
   <p>
    Her lip curled, and then, turning to me, she continued: "If there are
   </p>
   <p>
    houses in your island without mothers in them, it is not so elsewhere in
   </p>
   <p>
    the world. That you went out to travel so poorly provided with knowledge
   </p>
   <p>
    is a marvel to us; and as I have had the pain of telling you this, I
   </p>
   <p>
    must regret that you ever left your own home."
   </p>
   <p>
    I could make no reply to these words, which fell on me like
   </p>
   <p>
    whip-strokes; and looking at the other faces, I could see no sympathy in
   </p>
   <p>
    them for me; as they looked at her--their mother--and listened to her
   </p>
   <p>
    words, the expression they wore was love and devotion to her only,
   </p>
   <p>
    reminding me a little of the angel faces on Guide's canvas of the
   </p>
   <p>
    "Coronation of the Virgin."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Go now," she presently added in a petulant tone; "I am tired, and wish
   </p>
   <p>
    to rest"; and Yoletta, who had been standing silently by me all the
   </p>
   <p>
    time, took my hand and led me from the room.
   </p>
   <p>
    With eyes cast down I passed through the gallery, paying no attention to
   </p>
   <p>
    its strange, stony occupants; and leaving my gentle conductress without
   </p>
   <p>
    a word at the door of the music-room, I hurried away from the house. For
   </p>
   <p>
    I could feel love and compassion in the touch of the dear girl's hand,
   </p>
   <p>
    and it seemed to me that if she had spoken one word, my overcharged
   </p>
   <p>
    heart would have found vent in tears. I only wished to be alone, to
   </p>
   <p>
    brood in secret on my pain and the bitterness of defeat; for it was
   </p>
   <p>
    plain that the woman I had so wished to see, and, since seeing her, so
   </p>
   <p>
    wished to be allowed to love, felt towards me nothing but contempt and
   </p>
   <p>
    aversion, and that from no fault of my own, she, whose friendship I most
   </p>
   <p>
    needed, was become my enemy in the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    My steps took me to the river. Following its banks for about a mile, I
   </p>
   <p>
    came at last to a grove of stately old trees, and there I seated myself
   </p>
   <p>
    on a large twisted root projecting over the water. To this sequestered
   </p>
   <p>
    spot I had come to indulge my resentful feelings; for here I could speak
   </p>
   <p>
    out my bitterness aloud, if I felt so minded, where there were no
   </p>
   <p>
    witnesses to hear me. I had restrained those unmanly tears, so nearly
   </p>
   <p>
    shed in Yoletta's presence, and kept back by dark thoughts on the way;
   </p>
   <p>
    now I was sitting quietly by myself, safe from observation, safe even
   </p>
   <p>
    from that sympathy my bruised spirit could not suffer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Scarcely had I seated myself before a great brown animal, with black
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes, round and fierce, rose to the surface of the stream half a dozen
   </p>
   <p>
    yards from my feet; then quickly catching sight of me, it plunged
   </p>
   <p>
    noisily again under water, breaking the clear image reflected there with
   </p>
   <p>
    a hundred ripples. I waited for the last wavelet to fade away, but when
   </p>
   <p>
    the surface was once more still and smooth as dark glass, I began to be
   </p>
   <p>
    affected by the profounded silence and melancholy of nature, and by a
   </p>
   <p>
    something proceeding from nature--phantom, emanation, essence, I know
   </p>
   <p>
    not what. My soul, not my sense, perceived it, standing with finger on
   </p>
   <p>
    lips, there, close to me; its feet resting on the motionless water,
   </p>
   <p>
    which gave no reflection of its image, the clear amber sunlight passing
   </p>
   <p>
    undimmed through its substance. To my soul its spoken "Hush!" was
   </p>
   <p>
    audible, and again, and yet again, it said "Hush!" until the tumult in
   </p>
   <p>
    me was still, and I could not think my own thoughts. I could thereafter
   </p>
   <p>
    only listen, breathless, straining my senses to catch some natural
   </p>
   <p>
    sound, however faint. Far away in the dim distance, in some blue
   </p>
   <p>
    pasture, a cow was lowing, and the recurring sound passed me like the
   </p>
   <p>
    humming flight of an insect, then fainter still, like an imagined sound,
   </p>
   <p>
    until it ceased. A withered leaf fell from the tree-top; I heard it
   </p>
   <p>
    fluttering downwards, touching other leaves in its fall until the silent
   </p>
   <p>
    grass received it. Then, as I listened for another leaf, suddenly from
   </p>
   <p>
    overhead came the brief gushing melody of some late singer, a robin-like
   </p>
   <p>
    sound, ringing out clear and distinct as a flourish on a clarionet:
   </p>
   <p>
    brilliant, joyous, and unexpected, yet in keeping with that melancholy
   </p>
   <p>
    quiet, affecting the mind like a spray of gold and scarlet embroidery on
   </p>
   <p>
    a pale, neutral ground. The sun went down, and in setting, kindled the
   </p>
   <p>
    boles of the old trees here and there into pillars of red fire, while
   </p>
   <p>
    others in deeper shade looked by contrast like pillars of ebony; and
   </p>
   <p>
    wherever the foliage was thinnest, the level rays shining through
   </p>
   <p>
    imparted to the sere leaves a translucence and splendor that was like
   </p>
   <p>
    the stained glass in the windows of some darkening cathedral. All along
   </p>
   <p>
    the river a white mist began to rise, a slight wind sprang up and the
   </p>
   <p>
    vapor drifted, drowning the reeds and bushes, and wreathing its ghostly
   </p>
   <p>
    arms about the old trees: and watching the mist, and listening to the
   </p>
   <p>
    "hallowed airs and symphonies" whispered by the low wind, I felt that
   </p>
   <p>
    there was no longer any anger in my heart. Nature, and something in and
   </p>
   <p>
    yet more than nature, had imparted her "soft influences" and healed her
   </p>
   <p>
    "wandering and distempered child" until he could no more be a "jarring
   </p>
   <p>
    and discordant thing" in her sweet and sacred presence.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I looked up a change had come over the scene: the round, full moon
   </p>
   <p>
    had risen, silvering the mist, and filling the wide, dim earth with a
   </p>
   <p>
    new mysterious glory. I rose from my seat and returned to the house, and
   </p>
   <p>
    with that new insight and comprehension which had come to me--that
   </p>
   <p>
    message, as I could not but regard it--I now felt nothing but
   </p>
   <p>
    love and sympathy for the suffering woman who had wounded me with her
   </p>
   <p>
    unmerited displeasure, and my only desire was to show my devotion to
   </p>
   <p>
    her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 13
   </p>
   <p>
    As I approached the building, soft strains floating far out into the
   </p>
   <p>
    night-air became audible, and I knew that the sweet spirit of music, to
   </p>
   <p>
    which they were all so devoted, was present with them. After listening
   </p>
   <p>
    for awhile in the shadow of the portico I went in, and, anxious to avoid
   </p>
   <p>
    disturbing the singers, stole away into a dusky corner, where I sat down
   </p>
   <p>
    by myself. Yoletta had, however, seen me enter, for presently she came
   </p>
   <p>
    to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why did you not come in to supper, Smith?" she said. "And why do you
   </p>
   <p>
    look so sad?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you need to ask, Yoletta? Ah, it would have made me so happy if I
   </p>
   <p>
    could have won your mother's affection! If she only knew how much I wish
   </p>
   <p>
    for it, and how much I sympathize with her! But she will never like me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and all I wished to say to her must be left unsaid."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, not so," she said. "Come with me to her now: if you feel like that,
   </p>
   <p>
    she will be kind to you--how should it be otherwise?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I greatly feared that she advised me to take an imprudent step; but she
   </p>
   <p>
    was my guide, my teacher and friend in the house, and I resolved to do
   </p>
   <p>
    as she wished. There were no lights in the long gallery when we entered
   </p>
   <p>
    it again, only the white moonbeams coming through the tall windows here
   </p>
   <p>
    and there lit up a column or a group of statues, which threw long, black
   </p>
   <p>
    shadows on floor and Wall, giving the chamber a weird appearance. Once
   </p>
   <p>
    more, when I reached the middle of the room, I paused, for there before
   </p>
   <p>
    me, ever bending forward, sat that wonderful woman of stone, the
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlight streaming full on her pale, wistful face and silvery hair.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Tell me, Yoletta, who is this?" I whispered. "Is it a statue of some
   </p>
   <p>
    one who lived in this house?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes; you can read about her in the history of the house, and in this
   </p>
   <p>
    inscription on the stone. She was a mother, and her name was Isarte."
   </p>
   <p>
    "But why has she that strange, haunting expression on her face? Was she
   </p>
   <p>
    unhappy?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, can you not see that she was unhappy! She endured many sorrows, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the crowning calamity of her life was the loss of seven loved sons. They
   </p>
   <p>
    were away in the mountains together, and did not return when expected:
   </p>
   <p>
    for many years she waited for tidings of them. It was conjectured that a
   </p>
   <p>
    great rock had fallen on and crushed them beneath it. Grief for her lost
   </p>
   <p>
    children made her hair white, and gave that expression to her face."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And when did this happen?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Over two thousand years ago."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, then it is a very old family tradition. But the statue--when was
   </p>
   <p>
    that made and placed here?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "She had it made and placed here herself. It was her wish that the grief
   </p>
   <p>
    she endured should be remembered in the house for all time, for no one
   </p>
   <p>
    had ever suffered like her; and the inscription, which she caused to be
   </p>
   <p>
    put on the stone, says that if there shall ever come to a mother in the
   </p>
   <p>
    house a sorrow exceeding hers, the statue shall be removed from its
   </p>
   <p>
    place and destroyed, and the fragments buried in the earth with all
   </p>
   <p>
    forgotten things, and the name of Isarte forgotten in the house."
   </p>
   <p>
    It oppressed my mind to think of so long a period of time during which
   </p>
   <p>
    that unutterably sad face had gazed down on so many generations of the
   </p>
   <p>
    living. "It is most strange!" I murmured. "But do you think it right,
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta, that the grief of one person should be perpetuated like that in
   </p>
   <p>
    the house; for who can look on this face without pain, even when it is
   </p>
   <p>
    remembered that the sorrow it expresses ended so many centuries ago?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "But she was a mother, Smith, do you not understand? It would not be
   </p>
   <p>
    right for us to wish to have our griefs remembered for ever, to cause
   </p>
   <p>
    sorrow to those who succeed us; but a mother is different: her wishes
   </p>
   <p>
    are sacred, and what she wills is right."
   </p>
   <p>
    Her words surprised me not a little, for I had heard of infallible men,
   </p>
   <p>
    but never of women; moreover, the woman I was now going to see was also
   </p>
   <p>
    a "mother in the house," a successor to this very Isarte. Fearing that I
   </p>
   <p>
    had touched on a dangerous topic, I said no more, and proceeding on our
   </p>
   <p>
    way, we soon reached the mother's room, the large glass door of which
   </p>
   <p>
    now stood wide open. In the pale light of the moon--for there was no
   </p>
   <p>
    other in the room--we found Chastel on the couch where I had seen her
   </p>
   <p>
    before, but she was lying extended at full length now, and had only one
   </p>
   <p>
    attendant with her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta approached her, and, stooping, touched her lips to the pale,
   </p>
   <p>
    still face. "Mother," she said, "I have brought Smith again; he is
   </p>
   <p>
    anxious to say something to you, if you will hear him."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, I will hear him," she replied. "Let him sit near me; and now go
   </p>
   <p>
    back, for your voice is needed. And you may also leave me now," she
   </p>
   <p>
    added, addressing the other lady.
   </p>
   <p>
    The two then departed together, and I proceeded to seat myself on a
   </p>
   <p>
    cushion beside the couch.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What is it you wish to say to me?" she asked. The words were not very
   </p>
   <p>
    encouraging, but her voice sounded gentler now, and I at once began.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Hush," she said, before I had spoken two words. "Wait until this
   </p>
   <p>
    ends--I am listening to Yoletta's voice."
   </p>
   <p>
    Through the long, dusky gallery and the open doors soft strains of music
   </p>
   <p>
    were floating to us, and now, mingling with the others, a clearer,
   </p>
   <p>
    bell-like voice was heard, which soared to greater heights; but soon
   </p>
   <p>
    this ceased to be distinguishable, and then she sighed and addressed me
   </p>
   <p>
    again. "Where have you been all the evening, for you were not at
   </p>
   <p>
    supper?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Did you know that?" I asked in surprise.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, I know everything that passes in the house. Reading and work of
   </p>
   <p>
    all kinds are a pain and weariness. The only thing left to me is to
   </p>
   <p>
    listen to what others do or say, and to know all their comings and
   </p>
   <p>
    goings. My life is nothing now but a shadow of other people's lives."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Then," I said, "I must tell you how I spent the time after seeing you
   </p>
   <p>
    to-day; for I was alone, and no other person can say what I did. I went
   </p>
   <p>
    away along the river until I came to the grove of great trees on the
   </p>
   <p>
    bank, and there I sat until the moon rose, with my heart full of
   </p>
   <p>
    unspeakable pain and bitterness."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What made you have those feelings?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "When I heard of you, and saw you, my heart was drawn to you, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    wished above all things in the world to be allowed to love and serve
   </p>
   <p>
    you, and to have a share in your affection; but your looks and words
   </p>
   <p>
    expressed only contempt and dislike towards me. Would it not have been
   </p>
   <p>
    strange if I had not felt extremely unhappy?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh," she replied, "now I can understand the reason of the surprise your
   </p>
   <p>
    words have often caused in the house! Your very feelings seem unlike
   </p>
   <p>
    ours. No other person would have experienced the feelings you speak of
   </p>
   <p>
    for such a cause. It is right to repent your faults, and to bear the
   </p>
   <p>
    burden of them quietly; but it is a sign of an undisciplined spirit to
   </p>
   <p>
    feel bitterness, and to wish to cast the blame of your suffering on
   </p>
   <p>
    another. You forget that I had reason to be deeply offended with you.
   </p>
   <p>
    You also forget my continual suffering, which sometimes makes me seem
   </p>
   <p>
    harsh and unkind against my will."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Your words seem only sweet and gracious now," I returned. "They have
   </p>
   <p>
    lifted a great weight from my heart, and I wish I could repay you for
   </p>
   <p>
    them by taking some portion of your suffering on myself."
   </p>
   <p>
    "It is right that you should have that feeling, but idle to express it,"
   </p>
   <p>
    she answered gravely. "If such wishes could be fulfilled my sufferings
   </p>
   <p>
    would have long ceased, since any one of my children would gladly lay
   </p>
   <p>
    down his life to procure me ease."
   </p>
   <p>
    To this speech, which sounded like another rebuke, I made no reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, this is bitterness indeed--a bitterness you cannot know," she
   </p>
   <p>
    resumed after a while. "For you and for others there is always the
   </p>
   <p>
    refuge of death from continued sufferings: the brief pang of
   </p>
   <p>
    dissolution, bravely met, is nothing in comparison with a lingering
   </p>
   <p>
    agony like mine, with its long days and longer nights, extending to
   </p>
   <p>
    years, and that great blackness of the end ever before the mind. This
   </p>
   <p>
    only a mother can know, since the horror of utter darkness, and vain
   </p>
   <p>
    clinging to life, even when it has ceased to have any hope or joy in it,
   </p>
   <p>
    is the penalty she must pay for her higher state."
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not understand all her words, and only murmured in reply: "You
   </p>
   <p>
    are young to speak of death."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, young; that is why it is so bitter to think of. In old age the
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings are not so keen." Then suddenly she put out her hands towards
   </p>
   <p>
    me, and, when I offered mine, caught my fingers with a nervous grasp and
   </p>
   <p>
    drew herself to a sitting position. "Ah, why must I be afflicted with a
   </p>
   <p>
    misery others have not known!" she exclaimed excitedly. "To be lifted
   </p>
   <p>
    above the others, when so young; to have one child only; then after so
   </p>
   <p>
    brief a period of happiness, to be smitten with barrenness, and this
   </p>
   <p>
    lingering malady ever gnawing like a canker at the roots of life! Who
   </p>
   <p>
    has suffered like me in the house? You only, Isarte, among the dead. I
   </p>
   <p>
    will go to you, for my grief is more than I can bear; and it may be that
   </p>
   <p>
    I shall find comfort even in speaking to the dead, and to a stone. Can
   </p>
   <p>
    you bear me in your arms?" she said, clasping me round the neck. "Take
   </p>
   <p>
    me up in your arms and carry me to Isarte."
   </p>
   <p>
    I knew what she meant, having so recently heard the story of Isarte, and
   </p>
   <p>
    in obedience to her command I raised her from the couch. She was tall,
   </p>
   <p>
    and heavier than I had expected, though so greatly emaciated; but the
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that she was Yoletta's mother, and the mother of the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    nerved me to my task, and cautiously moving step by step through the
   </p>
   <p>
    gloom, I carried her safely to that white-haired, moonlit woman of stone
   </p>
   <p>
    in the long gallery. When I had ascended the steps and brought her
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficiently near, she put her arms about the statue, and pressed its
   </p>
   <p>
    stony lips with hers.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Isarte, Isarte, how cold your lips are!" she murmured, in low,
   </p>
   <p>
    desponding tones. "Now, when I look into these eyes, which are yours,
   </p>
   <p>
    and yet not yours, and kiss these stony lips, how sorely does the hunger
   </p>
   <p>
    in my heart tempt me to sin! But suffering has not darkened my reason; I
   </p>
   <p>
    know it is an offense to ask anything of Him who gives us life and all
   </p>
   <p>
    good things freely, and has no pleasure in seeing us miserable. This
   </p>
   <p>
    thought restrains me; else I would cry to Him to turn this stone to
   </p>
   <p>
    flesh, and for one brief hour to bring back to it the vanished spirit of
   </p>
   <p>
    Isarte. For there is no one living that can understand my pain; but you
   </p>
   <p>
    would understand it, and put my tired head against your breast, and
   </p>
   <p>
    cover me with your grief-whitened hair as with a mantle. For your pain
   </p>
   <p>
    was like mine, and exceeded mine, and no soul could measure it,
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore in the hunger of your heart you looked far off into the
   </p>
   <p>
    future, where some one would perhaps have a like affliction, and suffer
   </p>
   <p>
    without hope, as you suffered, and measure your pain, and love your
   </p>
   <p>
    memory, and feel united with you, even over the gulf of long centuries
   </p>
   <p>
    of time. You would speak to me of it all, and tell me that the greatest
   </p>
   <p>
    grief was to go away into darkness, leaving no one with your blood and
   </p>
   <p>
    your spirit to inherit the house. This also is my grief, Isarte, for I
   </p>
   <p>
    am barren and eaten up by death, and must soon go away to be where you
   </p>
   <p>
    are. When I am gone, the father of the house will take no other one to
   </p>
   <p>
    his bosom, for he is old, and his life is nearly complete; and in a
   </p>
   <p>
    little while he will follow me, but with no pain and anguish like mine
   </p>
   <p>
    to cloud his serene spirit. And who will then inherit our place? Ah, my
   </p>
   <p>
    sister, how bitter to think of it! for then a stranger will be the
   </p>
   <p>
    mother of the house, and my one only child will sit at her feet, calling
   </p>
   <p>
    her mother, serving her with her hands, and loving and worshiping her
   </p>
   <p>
    with her heart!"
   </p>
   <p>
    The excitement had now burned itself out: she had dropped her head
   </p>
   <p>
    wearily on my shoulder, and bade me take her back. When I had safely
   </p>
   <p>
    deposited her on the couch again, she remained for some minutes with her
   </p>
   <p>
    face covered, silently weeping.
   </p>
   <p>
    The scene in the gallery had deeply affected me; now, however, while I
   </p>
   <p>
    sat by her, pondering over it, my mind reverted to that vanished world
   </p>
   <p>
    of sorrow and different social conditions in which I had lived, and
   </p>
   <p>
    where the lot of so many poor suffering souls seemed to me so much more
   </p>
   <p>
    desolate than that of this unhappy lady, who had, I imagined, much to
   </p>
   <p>
    console her. It even seemed to me that the grief I had witnessed was
   </p>
   <p>
    somewhat morbid and overstrained; and, thinking that it would perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    divert her mind from brooding too much over her own troubles, I
   </p>
   <p>
    ventured, when she had grown calm again, to tell her some of my
   </p>
   <p>
    memories. I asked her to imagine a state of the world and the human
   </p>
   <p>
    family, in which all women were, in one sense, on an equality--all
   </p>
   <p>
    possessing the same capacity for suffering; and where all were, or would
   </p>
   <p>
    be, wives and mothers, and without any such mysterious remedy against
   </p>
   <p>
    lingering pain as she had spoken of. But I had not proceeded far with my
   </p>
   <p>
    picture before she interrupted me.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do not say more," she said, with an accent of displeasure. "This, I
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose, is another of those grotesque fancies you sometimes give
   </p>
   <p>
    expression to, about which I heard a great deal when you first came to
   </p>
   <p>
    us. That all people should be equal, and all women wives and mothers
   </p>
   <p>
    seems to me a very disordered and a very repulsive idea The one
   </p>
   <p>
    consolation in my pain, the one glory of my life could not exist in such
   </p>
   <p>
    a state as that, and my condition would be pitiable indeed. All others
   </p>
   <p>
    would be equally miserable. The human race would multiply, until the
   </p>
   <p>
    fruits of the soil would be insufficient for its support; and earth
   </p>
   <p>
    would be filled with degenerate beings, starved in body and debased in
   </p>
   <p>
    mind--all clinging to an existence utterly without joy. Life is dark to
   </p>
   <p>
    me, but not to others: these are matters beyond you, and it is
   </p>
   <p>
    presumptuous in one of your condition to attempt to comfort me with idle
   </p>
   <p>
    fancies."
   </p>
   <p>
    After some moments of silence, she resumed: "The father has said to-day
   </p>
   <p>
    that you came to us from an island where even the customs of the people
   </p>
   <p>
    are different from ours; and perhaps one of their unhappy methods is to
   </p>
   <p>
    seek to medicine a real misery by imagining some impossible and
   </p>
   <p>
    immeasurably greater one. In no other way can I account for your strange
   </p>
   <p>
    words to me; for I cannot believe that any race exists so debased as
   </p>
   <p>
    actually to practice the things you speak of. Remember that I do not ask
   </p>
   <p>
    or desire to be informed. We have a different way; for although it is
   </p>
   <p>
    conceivable that present misery might be mitigated, or forgotten for a
   </p>
   <p>
    season, by giving up the soul to delusions, even by summoning before the
   </p>
   <p>
    mind repulsive and horrible images, that would be to put to an unlawful
   </p>
   <p>
    use, and to pervert, the brightest faculties our Father has given us:
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore we seek no other support in all sufferings and calamities but
   </p>
   <p>
    that of reason only. If you wish for my affection, you will not speak of
   </p>
   <p>
    such things again, but will endeavor to purify yourself from a mental
   </p>
   <p>
    vice, which may sometimes, in periods of suffering, give you a false
   </p>
   <p>
    comfort for a brief season, only to degrade you, and sink you later in a
   </p>
   <p>
    deeper misery. You must now leave me."
   </p>
   <p>
    This unexpected and sharp rebuke did not anger me, but it made me very
   </p>
   <p>
    sad; for I now perceived plainly enough that no great advantage would
   </p>
   <p>
    come to me from Chastel's acquaintance, since it was necessary to be so
   </p>
   <p>
    very circumspect with her. Deeply troubled, and in a somewhat confused
   </p>
   <p>
    state of mind, I rose to depart. Then she placed her thin, feverish
   </p>
   <p>
    white hand on mine. "You need not go away again," she said, "to indulge
   </p>
   <p>
    in bitter feelings by yourself because I have said this to you. You may
   </p>
   <p>
    come with the others to see me and talk to me whenever I am able to sit
   </p>
   <p>
    here and bear it. I shall not remember your offense, but shall be glad
   </p>
   <p>
    to know that there is another soul in the house to love and honor me."
   </p>
   <p>
    With such comfort as these words afforded I returned to the music-room,
   </p>
   <p>
    and, finding it empty, went out to the terrace, where the others were
   </p>
   <p>
    now strolling about in knots and couples, conversing and enjoying the
   </p>
   <p>
    lovely moonlight. Wandering a little distance away by myself, I sat down
   </p>
   <p>
    on a bench under a tree, and presently Yoletta came to me there, and
   </p>
   <p>
    closely scrutinized my face.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Have you nothing to tell me?" she asked. "Are you happier now?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, dearest, for I have been spoke to very kindly; and I should have
   </p>
   <p>
    been happier if only--" But I checked myself in time, and said no more
   </p>
   <p>
    to her about my conversation with the mother. To myself I said: "Oh,
   </p>
   <p>
    that island, that island! Why can't I forget its miserable customs, or,
   </p>
   <p>
    at any rate, stick to my own resolution to hold my tongue about them?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 14
   </p>
   <p>
    From that day I was frequently allowed to enter the Mother's Room, but,
   </p>
   <p>
    as I had feared, these visits failed to bring me into any closer
   </p>
   <p>
    relationship with the lady of the house. She had indeed forgotten my
   </p>
   <p>
    offense: I was one of her children, sharing equally with the others in
   </p>
   <p>
    her impartial affection, and privileged to sit at her feet to relate to
   </p>
   <p>
    her the incidents of the day, or describe all I had seen, and sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    to touch her thin white hand with my lips. But the distance separating
   </p>
   <p>
    us was not forgotten. At the two first interviews she had taught me,
   </p>
   <p>
    once for all, that it was for me to love, honor, and serve her, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    anything beyond that--any attempt to win her confidence, to enter into
   </p>
   <p>
    her thoughts, or make her understand my feelings and aspirations--was
   </p>
   <p>
    regarded as pure presumption on my part. The result was that I was less
   </p>
   <p>
    happy than I had been before knowing her: my naturally buoyant and
   </p>
   <p>
    hopeful temper became tinged with melancholy, and that vision of
   </p>
   <p>
    exquisite bliss in the future, which had floated before me, luring me
   </p>
   <p>
    on, now began to look pale, and to seem further and further away.
   </p>
   <p>
    After my walk with Yoletta--if it can be called a walk--I began to look
   </p>
   <p>
    out for the rainbow lilies, and soon discovered that everywhere under
   </p>
   <p>
    the grass they were beginning to sprout from the soil. At first I found
   </p>
   <p>
    them in the moist valley of the river, but very soon they were equally
   </p>
   <p>
    abundant on the higher lands, and even on barren, stony places, where
   </p>
   <p>
    they appeared latest. I felt very curious about these flowers, of which
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta had spoken so enthusiastically, and watched the slow growth of
   </p>
   <p>
    the long, slender buds from day to day with considerable impatience. At
   </p>
   <p>
    length, in a moist hollow of the forest, I was delighted to find the
   </p>
   <p>
    full-blown flower. In shape it resembled a tulip, but was more open, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the color a most vivid orange yellow; it had a slight delicate perfume,
   </p>
   <p>
    and was very pretty, with a peculiar waxy gloss on the thick petals,
   </p>
   <p>
    still, I was rather disappointed, since the name of "rainbow lily," and
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta's words, had led me to expect a many-colored flower of
   </p>
   <p>
    surpassing beauty.
   </p>
   <p>
    I plucked the lily carefully, and was taking it home to present it to
   </p>
   <p>
    her, when all at once I remembered that only on one occasion had I seen
   </p>
   <p>
    flowers in her hand, and in the hands of the others, and that was when
   </p>
   <p>
    they were burying their dead. They never wore a flower, nor had I ever
   </p>
   <p>
    seen one in the house, not even in that room where Chastel was kept a
   </p>
   <p>
    prisoner by her malady, and where her greatest delight was to have
   </p>
   <p>
    nature in all its beauty and fragrance brought to her in the
   </p>
   <p>
    conversation of her children. The only flowers in the house were in
   </p>
   <p>
    their illuminations, and those wrought in metal and carved in wood, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the immortal, stony flowers of many brilliant hues in their mosaics. I
   </p>
   <p>
    began to fear that there was some superstition which made it seem wrong
   </p>
   <p>
    to them to gather flowers, except for funeral ceremonies, and afraid of
   </p>
   <p>
    offending from want of thought, I dropped the lily on the ground, and
   </p>
   <p>
    said nothing about it to any one.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, before any more open lilies were found, an unexpected sorrow came
   </p>
   <p>
    to me. After changing my dress on returning from the fields one
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon, I was taken to the hall of judgment, and at once jumped to
   </p>
   <p>
    the conclusion that I had again unwittingly fallen into disgrace; but on
   </p>
   <p>
    arriving at that uncomfortable apartment I perceived that this was not
   </p>
   <p>
    the case. Looking round at the assembled company I missed Yoletta, and
   </p>
   <p>
    my heart sank in me, and I even wished that my first impression had
   </p>
   <p>
    proved correct. On the great stone table, before which the father was
   </p>
   <p>
    seated, lay an open folio, the leaf displayed being only illuminated at
   </p>
   <p>
    the top and inner margin; the colored part at the top I noticed was
   </p>
   <p>
    torn, the rent extending down to about the middle of the page.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently the dear girl appeared, with tearful eyes and flushed face,
   </p>
   <p>
    and advancing hurriedly to the father, she stood before him with
   </p>
   <p>
    downcast eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    "My daughter, tell me how and why you did this?" he demanded, pointing
   </p>
   <p>
    to the open volume.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, father, look at this," she returned, half-sobbing, and touching the
   </p>
   <p>
    lower end of the colored margin with her finger. "Do you see how badly
   </p>
   <p>
    it is colored? And I had spent three days in altering and retouching it,
   </p>
   <p>
    and still it displeased me. Then, in sudden anger, I pushed the book
   </p>
   <p>
    from me, and seeing it slipping from the stand I caught the leaf to
   </p>
   <p>
    prevent it from falling, and it was torn by the weight of the book. Oh,
   </p>
   <p>
    dear father, will you forgive me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Forgive you, my daughter? Do you not know how it grieves my heart to
   </p>
   <p>
    punish you; but how can this offense to the house be forgiven, which
   </p>
   <p>
    must stand in evidence against us from generation to generation? For we
   </p>
   <p>
    cease to be, but the house remains; and the writing we leave on it,
   </p>
   <p>
    whether it be good or evil, that too remains for ever. An unkind word is
   </p>
   <p>
    an evil thing, an unkind deed a worse, but when these are repented they
   </p>
   <p>
    may be forgiven and forgotten. But an injury done to the house cannot be
   </p>
   <p>
    forgotten, for it is the flaw in the stone that keeps its place, the
   </p>
   <p>
    crude, inharmonious color which cannot be washed out with water.
   </p>
   <p>
    Consider, my daughter, in the long life of the house, how many unborn
   </p>
   <p>
    men will turn the leaves of this book, and coming to this leaf will be
   </p>
   <p>
    offended at so grievous a disfigurement! If we of this generation were
   </p>
   <p>
    destined to live for ever, then it might be written on this page for a
   </p>
   <p>
    punishment and warning:" Yoletta tore it in her anger. "But we must pass
   </p>
   <p>
    away and be nothing to succeeding generations, and it would not be right
   </p>
   <p>
    that Yoletta's name should be remembered for the wrong she did to the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, and all she did for its good forgotten."
   </p>
   <p>
    A painful silence ensued, then, lifting her tear-stained face, she said:
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh father, what must my punishment be?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Dear child, it will be a light one, for we consider your youth and
   </p>
   <p>
    impulsive nature, and also that the wrong you did was partly the result
   </p>
   <p>
    of accident. For thirty days you must live apart from us, subsisting on
   </p>
   <p>
    bread and water, and holding intercourse with one person only, who will
   </p>
   <p>
    assist you with your work and provide you with all things necessary."
   </p>
   <p>
    This seemed to me a harsh, even a cruel punishment for so trivial an
   </p>
   <p>
    offense, or accident, rather; but she was not perhaps of the same mind,
   </p>
   <p>
    for she kissed his hand, as if in gratitude for his leniency.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Tell me, child," he said, putting his hand on her head, and regarding
   </p>
   <p>
    her with misty eyes, "who shall attend you in your seclusion?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Edra," she murmured; and the other, coming forward, took her by the
   </p>
   <p>
    hand and led her away.
   </p>
   <p>
    I gazed eagerly after her as she retired, hungering for one look from
   </p>
   <p>
    her dear eyes before that long separation; but they were filled with
   </p>
   <p>
    tears and bent on the floor, and in a moment she was gone from sight.
   </p>
   <p>
    The succeeding days were to me dreary beyond description. For the first
   </p>
   <p>
    time I became fully conscious of the strength of a passion which had now
   </p>
   <p>
    become a consuming fire in my breast, and could only end in utter
   </p>
   <p>
    misery--perhaps in destruction--or else in a degree of happiness no
   </p>
   <p>
    mortal had ever tasted before. I went about listlessly, like one on whom
   </p>
   <p>
    some heavy calamity has fallen: all interest in my work was lost; my
   </p>
   <p>
    food seemed tasteless; study and conversation had become a weariness;
   </p>
   <p>
    even in those divine concerts, which fitly brought each tranquil day to
   </p>
   <p>
    its close, there was no charm now, since Yoletta's voice, which love had
   </p>
   <p>
    taught my dull ear to distinguish no longer had any part in it. I was
   </p>
   <p>
    not allowed to enter the Mother's Room of an evening now, and the
   </p>
   <p>
    exclusion extended also to the others, Edra only excepted; for at this
   </p>
   <p>
    hour, when it was customary for the family to gather in the music-room,
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta was taken from her lonely chamber to be with her mother. This
   </p>
   <p>
    was told me, and I also elicited, by means of some roundabout
   </p>
   <p>
    questioning, that it was always in the mother's power to have any
   </p>
   <p>
    per-son undergoing punishment taken to her, she being, as it were, above
   </p>
   <p>
    the law. She could even pardon a delinquent and set him free if she felt
   </p>
   <p>
    so minded, although in this case she had not chosen to exercise her
   </p>
   <p>
    prerogative, probably because her "sufferings had not clouded her
   </p>
   <p>
    understanding." They were treating her very hardly--father and mother
   </p>
   <p>
    both--I thought in my bitterness.
   </p>
   <p>
    The gradual opening of the rainbow lilies served only to remind me every
   </p>
   <p>
    hour and every minute of that bright young spirit thus harshly deprived
   </p>
   <p>
    of the pleasure she had so eagerly anticipated. She, above them all,
   </p>
   <p>
    rejoiced in the beauty of this visible world, regarding nature in some
   </p>
   <p>
    of its moods and aspects with a feeling almost bordering on adoration;
   </p>
   <p>
    but, alas! she alone was shut out from this glory which God had spread
   </p>
   <p>
    over the earth for the delight of all his children.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now I knew why these autumnal flowers were called rainbow lilies, and
   </p>
   <p>
    remembered how Yoletta had told me that they gave a beauty to the earth
   </p>
   <p>
    which could not be described or imagined. The flowers were all
   </p>
   <p>
    undoubtedly of one species, having the same shape and perfume, although
   </p>
   <p>
    varying greatly in size, according to the nature of the soil on which
   </p>
   <p>
    they grew. But in different situations they varied in color, one color
   </p>
   <p>
    blending with, or passing by degrees into another, wherever the soil
   </p>
   <p>
    altered its character. Along the valleys, where they first began to
   </p>
   <p>
    bloom, and in all moist situations, the hue was yellow, varying,
   </p>
   <p>
    according to the amount of moisture in different places, from pale
   </p>
   <p>
    primrose to deep orange, this passing again into vivid scarlet and reds
   </p>
   <p>
    of many shades. On the plains the reds prevailed, changing into various
   </p>
   <p>
    purples on hills and mountain slopes; but high on the mountains the
   </p>
   <p>
    color was blue; and this also had many gradations, from the lower deep
   </p>
   <p>
    cornflower blue to a delicate azure on the summits, resembling that of
   </p>
   <p>
    the forget-me-not and hairbell.
   </p>
   <p>
    The weather proved singularly favorable to those who spent their time in
   </p>
   <p>
    admiring the lilies, and this now seemed to be almost the only
   </p>
   <p>
    occupation of the inmates, excepting, of course, sick Chastel,
   </p>
   <p>
    imprisoned Yoletta, and myself--I being too forlorn to admire anything.
   </p>
   <p>
    Calm, bright days without a cloud succeeded each other, as if the very
   </p>
   <p>
    elements held the lilies sacred and ventured not to cast any shadow over
   </p>
   <p>
    their mystic splendor. Each morning one of the men would go out some
   </p>
   <p>
    distance from the house and blow on a horn, which could be heard
   </p>
   <p>
    distinctly two miles away; and presently a number of horses, in couples
   </p>
   <p>
    and troops, would come galloping in, after which they would remain all
   </p>
   <p>
    the morning grazing and gamboling about the house. These horses were now
   </p>
   <p>
    in constant requisition, all the members of the family, male and female,
   </p>
   <p>
    spending several hours every day in careering over the surrounding
   </p>
   <p>
    country, seemingly without any particular object. The contagion did not
   </p>
   <p>
    affect me, however, for, although I had always been a bold rider (in my
   </p>
   <p>
    own country), and excessively fond of horseback exercise, their fashion
   </p>
   <p>
    of riding without bridles, and on diminutive straw saddles, seemed to me
   </p>
   <p>
    neither safe nor pleasant.
   </p>
   <p>
    One morning after breakfasting, I took my ax, and was proceeding slowly,
   </p>
   <p>
    immersed in thought, to the forest, when hearing a slight swishing sound
   </p>
   <p>
    of hoofs on the grass, I turned and beheld the venerable father, mounted
   </p>
   <p>
    on his charger, and rushing away towards the hills at an insanely
   </p>
   <p>
    break-neck pace. His long garment was gathered tightly round his spare
   </p>
   <p>
    form, his feet drawn up and his head bent far forward, while the wind of
   </p>
   <p>
    his speed divided his beard, which flew out in two long streamers
   </p>
   <p>
    behind. All at once he caught sight of me, and, touching the animal's
   </p>
   <p>
    neck, swept gracefully round in narrowing circles, each circle bringing
   </p>
   <p>
    him nearer, until he came to a stand at my side; then his horse began
   </p>
   <p>
    rubbing his nose on my hand, its breath feeling like fire on my skin.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Smith," said he, with a grave smile, "if you cannot be happy unless you
   </p>
   <p>
    are laboring in the forest with your ax you must proceed with your
   </p>
   <p>
    wood-cutting; but I confess it surprises me as much to see you going to
   </p>
   <p>
    work on a day like this, as it would to see you walking inverted on your
   </p>
   <p>
    hands, and dangling your heels in the air."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why?" said I, surprised at this speech.
   </p>
   <p>
    "If you do not know I must tell you. At night we sleep; in the morning
   </p>
   <p>
    we bathe; we eat when we are hungry, converse when we feel inclined, and
   </p>
   <p>
    on most days labor a certain number of hours. But more than these
   </p>
   <p>
    things, which have a certain amount of pleasure in them, are the
   </p>
   <p>
    precious moments when nature reveals herself to us in all her beauty. We
   </p>
   <p>
    give ourselves wholly to her then, and she refreshes us; the splendor
   </p>
   <p>
    fades, but the wealth it brings to the soul remains to gladden us. That
   </p>
   <p>
    must be a dull spirit that cannot suspend its toil when the sun is
   </p>
   <p>
    setting in glory, or the violet rainbow appears on the cloud. Every day
   </p>
   <p>
    brings us special moments to gladden us, just as we have in the house
   </p>
   <p>
    every day our time of melody and recreation. But this supreme and more
   </p>
   <p>
    enduring glory of nature comes only once every year; and while it lasts,
   </p>
   <p>
    all labor, except that which is pressing and necessary, is unseemly, and
   </p>
   <p>
    an offense to the Father of the world." He paused, but I did not know
   </p>
   <p>
    what to say in reply, and presently he resumed: "My son, there are
   </p>
   <p>
    horses waiting for you, and unless you are more unlike us in mind than I
   </p>
   <p>
    ever imagined, you will now take one and ride to the hills, where, owing
   </p>
   <p>
    to the absence of forests, the earth can now be seen at its best."
   </p>
   <p>
    I was about to thank him and turn back, but the thought of Yoletta, to
   </p>
   <p>
    whom each heavy day now seemed a year, oppressed by heart, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    continued standing motionless, with downcast eyes, wishing, yet fearing,
   </p>
   <p>
    to speak.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Why is your mind troubled, my son?" he said kindly.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Father," I answered, that word which I now ventured to use for the
   </p>
   <p>
    first time trembling from my lips, "the beauty of the earth is very much
   </p>
   <p>
    to me, but I cannot help remembering that to Yoletta it is even more,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the thought takes away all my pleasure. The flowers will fade, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she will not see them."
   </p>
   <p>
    "My son, I am glad to hear these words," he answered, somewhat to my
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise, for I had greatly feared that I had adopted too bold a course.
   </p>
   <p>
    "For I see now," he continued, "that this seeming indifference, which
   </p>
   <p>
    gave me some pain, does not proceed from an incapacity on your part to
   </p>
   <p>
    feel as we do, but from a tender love and compassion--that most precious
   </p>
   <p>
    of all our emotions, which will serve to draw you closer to us. I have
   </p>
   <p>
    also thought much of Yoletta during these beautiful days, grieving for
   </p>
   <p>
    her, and this morning I have allowed her to go out into the hills, so
   </p>
   <p>
    that during this day, at least, she will be able to share in our
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasure."
   </p>
   <p>
    Scarcely waiting for another word to be spoken, I flew back to the
   </p>
   <p>
    house, anxious enough for a ride now. The little straw saddle seemed now
   </p>
   <p>
    as comfortable as a couch, nor was the bridle missed; for, nerved with
   </p>
   <p>
    that intense desire to find and speak to my love, I could have ridden
   </p>
   <p>
    securely on the slippery back of a giraffe, charging over rough ground
   </p>
   <p>
    with a pack of lions at its heels. Away I went at a speed never perhaps
   </p>
   <p>
    attained by any winner of the Derby, which made the shining hairs of my
   </p>
   <p>
    horse's mane whistle in the still air; down valleys, up hills, flying
   </p>
   <p>
    like a bird over roaring burns, rocks, and thorny bushes, never pausing
   </p>
   <p>
    until I was far away among those hills where that strange accident had
   </p>
   <p>
    befallen me, and from which I had recovered to find the earth so
   </p>
   <p>
    changed. I then ascended a great green hill, the top of which must have
   </p>
   <p>
    been over a thousand feet above the surrounding country. When I had at
   </p>
   <p>
    length reached this elevation, which I did walking and climbing, my
   </p>
   <p>
    steed docilely scrambling up after me, the richness and novelty of the
   </p>
   <p>
    unimaginable and indescribable scene which opened before me affected me
   </p>
   <p>
    in a strange way, smiting my heart with a pain intense and unfamiliar.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the first time I experienced within myself that miraculous power the
   </p>
   <p>
    mind possesses of reproducing instantaneously, and without perspective,
   </p>
   <p>
    the events, feelings, and thoughts of long years--an experience which
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes comes to a person suddenly confronted with death, and in other
   </p>
   <p>
    moments of supreme agitation. A thousand memories and a thousand
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts were stirring in me: I was conscious now, as I had not been
   </p>
   <p>
    before, of the past and the present, and these two existed in my mind,
   </p>
   <p>
    yet separated by a great gulf of time--a blank and a nothingness which
   </p>
   <p>
    yet oppressed me with its horrible vastness. How aimless and solitary,
   </p>
   <p>
    how awful my position seemed! It was like that of one beneath whose feet
   </p>
   <p>
    the world suddenly crumbles into ashes and dust, and is scattered
   </p>
   <p>
    throughout the illimitable void, while he survives, blown to some far
   </p>
   <p>
    planet whose strange aspect, however beautiful, fills him with an
   </p>
   <p>
    undefinable terror. And I knew, and the knowledge only intensified my
   </p>
   <p>
    pain, that my agitation, the strugglings of my soul to recover that lost
   </p>
   <p>
    life, were like the vain wing-beats of some woodland bird, blown away a
   </p>
   <p>
    thousand miles over the sea, into which it must at last sink down and
   </p>
   <p>
    perish.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such a mental state cannot endure for more than a few moments, and
   </p>
   <p>
    passing away, it left me weary and despondent. With dull, joyless eyes I
   </p>
   <p>
    continued gazing for upwards of an hour on the prospect beneath me; for
   </p>
   <p>
    I had now given up all hopes of seeing Yoletta, not yet having
   </p>
   <p>
    encountered a single person since starting for my ride. All about me the
   </p>
   <p>
    summit was dotted with small lilies of a delicate blue, but at a little
   </p>
   <p>
    distance the sober green of the grass became absorbed, as it were, in
   </p>
   <p>
    the brighter flower-tints, and the neighboring summits all appeared of a
   </p>
   <p>
    pure cerulean hue. Lower down this passed into the purples of the slopes
   </p>
   <p>
    and the reds of the plains, while the valleys, fringed with scarlet,
   </p>
   <p>
    were like rivers of crocus-colored fire. Distance, and the light,
   </p>
   <p>
    autumnal haze, had a subduing and harmonizing effect on the sea of
   </p>
   <p>
    brilliant color, and further away on the immense horizon it all faded
   </p>
   <p>
    into the soft universal blue. Over this flowery paradise my eyes
   </p>
   <p>
    wandered restlessly, for my heart was restless in me, and had lost the
   </p>
   <p>
    power of pleasure. With a slight bitterness I recalled some of the words
   </p>
   <p>
    the father had spoken to me that morning. It was all very well, I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought, for this venerable graybeard to talk about refreshing the soul
   </p>
   <p>
    with the sight of all this beauty; but he seemed to lose sight of the
   </p>
   <p>
    important fact that there was a considerable difference in our
   </p>
   <p>
    respective ages, that the raging hunger of the heart, which he had
   </p>
   <p>
    doubtless experienced at one time of his life, was, like bodily hunger,
   </p>
   <p>
    not to be appeased with splendid sunsets, rainbows and rainbow lilies,
   </p>
   <p>
    however beautiful they might seem to the eye.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently, on a second and lower summit of the long mountain I had
   </p>
   <p>
    ascended, I caught sight of a person on horseback, standing motionless
   </p>
   <p>
    as a figure of stone. At that distance the horse looked no bigger than a
   </p>
   <p>
    greyhound, yet so marvelously transparent was the mountain air, that I
   </p>
   <p>
    distinctly recognized Yoletta in the rider. I started up, and sprang
   </p>
   <p>
    joyfully onto my own horse, and waving my hand to attract her attention,
   </p>
   <p>
    galloped recklessly down the slope; but when I reached the opposing
   </p>
   <p>
    summit she was no longer there, nor anywhere in sight, and it was as if
   </p>
   <p>
    the earth had opened and swallowed her.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 15
   </p>
   <p>
    During Yoletta's seclusion, my education was not allowed to suffer, her
   </p>
   <p>
    place as instructress having been taken by Edra. I was pleased with this
   </p>
   <p>
    arrangement, thinking to derive some benefit from it, beyond what she
   </p>
   <p>
    might teach me; but very soon I was forced to abandon all hope of
   </p>
   <p>
    communicating with the imprisoned girl through her friend and jailer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Edra was much disturbed at the suggestion; for I did venture to suggest
   </p>
   <p>
    it, though in a tentative, roundabout form, not feeling sure of my
   </p>
   <p>
    ground: previous mistakes had made me cautious. Her manner was a
   </p>
   <p>
    sufficient warning; and I did not broach the subject a second time. One
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon, however, I met with a great and unexpected consolation,
   </p>
   <p>
    though even this was mixed with some perplexing matters.
   </p>
   <p>
    One day, after looking long and earnestly into my face, said my gentle
   </p>
   <p>
    teacher to me; "Do you know that you are changed? All your gay spirits
   </p>
   <p>
    have left you, and you are pale and thin and sad. Why is this?"
   </p>
   <p>
    My face crimsoned at this very direct question, for I knew of that
   </p>
   <p>
    change in me, and went about in continual fear that others would
   </p>
   <p>
    presently notice it, and draw their own conclusions. She continued
   </p>
   <p>
    looking at me, until for very shame I turned my face aside; for if I had
   </p>
   <p>
    confessed that separation from Yoletta caused my dejection, she would
   </p>
   <p>
    know what that feeling meant, and I feared that any such premature
   </p>
   <p>
    declaration would be the ruin of my prospects.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I know the reason, though I ask you," she continued, placing a hand on
   </p>
   <p>
    my shoulder. "You are grieving for Yoletta--I saw it from the first. I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall tell her how pale and sad you have grown--how different from what
   </p>
   <p>
    you were. But why do you turn your face from me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I was perplexed, but her sympathy gave me courage, and made me
   </p>
   <p>
    determined to give her my confidence. "If you know," said I, "that I am
   </p>
   <p>
    grieving for Yoletta, can you not also guess why I hesitate and hide my
   </p>
   <p>
    face from you?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No; why is it? You love me also, though not with so great a love; but
   </p>
   <p>
    we do love each other, Smith, and you can confide in me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    I looked into her face now, straight into her transparent eyes, and it
   </p>
   <p>
    was plain to see that she had not yet guessed my meaning.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Dearest Edra," I said, taking her hand, "I love you as much as if one
   </p>
   <p>
    mother had given us birth. But I love Yoletta with a different love--not
   </p>
   <p>
    as one loves a sister. She is more to me than any one else in the world;
   </p>
   <p>
    so much is she that life without her would be a burden. Do you not know
   </p>
   <p>
    what that means?" And then, remembering Yoletta's words on the hills, I
   </p>
   <p>
    added: "Do you not know of more than one kind of love?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No," she answered, still gazing inquiringly into my face. "But I know
   </p>
   <p>
    that your love for her so greatly exceeds all others, that it is like a
   </p>
   <p>
    different feeling. I shall tell her, since it is sweet to be loved, and
   </p>
   <p>
    she will be glad to know it."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And after you have told her, Edra, shall you make known her reply to
   </p>
   <p>
    me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, Smith; it is an offense to suggest, or even to think, such a thing,
   </p>
   <p>
    however much you may love her, for she is not allowed to converse with
   </p>
   <p>
    any one directly or through me. She told me that she saw you on the
   </p>
   <p>
    hills, and that you tried to go to her, and it distressed her very much.
   </p>
   <p>
    But she will forgive you when I have told her how great your love is,
   </p>
   <p>
    that the desire to look on her face made you forget how wrong it was to
   </p>
   <p>
    approach her."
   </p>
   <p>
    How strange and incomprehensible it seemed that Edra had so
   </p>
   <p>
    misinterpreted my feeling! It seemed also to me that they all, from the
   </p>
   <p>
    father of the house downwards, were very blind indeed to set down so
   </p>
   <p>
    strong an emotion to mere brotherly affection. I had wished, yet feared,
   </p>
   <p>
    to remove the scales from their eyes; and now, in an unguarded moment, I
   </p>
   <p>
    had made the attempt, and my gentle confessor had failed to understand
   </p>
   <p>
    me. Nevertheless, I extracted some comfort from this conversation; for
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta would know how greatly my love exceeded that of her own kindred,
   </p>
   <p>
    and I hoped against hope that a responsive emotion would at last awaken
   </p>
   <p>
    in her breast.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the last of those leaden-footed thirty days arrived--the day on
   </p>
   <p>
    which, according to my computation, Yoletta would recover liberty before
   </p>
   <p>
    the sun set--I rose early from the straw pallet where I had tossed all
   </p>
   <p>
    night, prevented from sleeping by the prospect of reunion, and the fever
   </p>
   <p>
    of impatience I was in. The cold river revived me, and when we were
   </p>
   <p>
    assembled in the breakfast-room I observed Edra watching me, with a
   </p>
   <p>
    curious, questioning smile on her lips. I asked her the reason.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You are like a person suddenly recovered from sickness," she replied.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Your eyes sparkle like sunshine on the water, and your cheeks that were
   </p>
   <p>
    so pallid yesterday burn redder than an autumn leaf." Then, smiling, she
   </p>
   <p>
    added these precious words: "Yoletta will be glad to return to us, more
   </p>
   <p>
    on your account than her own."
   </p>
   <p>
    After we had broken our fast, I determined to go to the forest and spend
   </p>
   <p>
    the day there. For many days past I had shirked woodcutting; but now it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed impossible for me to settle down to any quiet, sedentary kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    work, the consuming impatience and boundless energy I felt making me
   </p>
   <p>
    wish for some unusually violent task, such as would exhaust the body and
   </p>
   <p>
    give, perhaps, a rest to the mind. Taking my ax, and the usual small
   </p>
   <p>
    basket of provisions for my noonday meal, I left the house; and on this
   </p>
   <p>
    morning I did not walk, but ran as if for a wager, taking long, flying
   </p>
   <p>
    leaps over bushes and streams that had never tempted me before. Arrived
   </p>
   <p>
    at the scene of action, I selected a large tree which had been marked
   </p>
   <p>
    out for felling, and for hours I hacked at it with an energy almost
   </p>
   <p>
    superhuman; and at last, before I had felt any disposition to rest, the
   </p>
   <p>
    towering old giant, bowing its head and rustling its sere foliage as if
   </p>
   <p>
    in eternal farewell to the skies, came with a mighty crash to the earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    Scarcely was it fallen before I felt that I had labored too long and
   </p>
   <p>
    violently: the dry, fresh breeze stung my burning cheeks like needles of
   </p>
   <p>
    ice, my knees trembled under me, and the whole world seemed to spin
   </p>
   <p>
    round; then, casting myself upon a bed of chips and withered leaves, I
   </p>
   <p>
    lay gasping for breath, with only life enough left in me to wonder
   </p>
   <p>
    whether I had fainted or not. Recovered at length from this exhausted
   </p>
   <p>
    condition, I sat up, and rejoiced to observe that half the day--that
   </p>
   <p>
    last miserable day--had already flown. Then the thoughts of the
   </p>
   <p>
    approaching evening, and all the happiness it would bring, inspired me
   </p>
   <p>
    with fresh zeal and strength, and, starting to my feet, and taking no
   </p>
   <p>
    thought of my food, I picked up the ax and made a fresh onslaught on the
   </p>
   <p>
    fallen tree. I had already accomplished more than a day's work, but the
   </p>
   <p>
    fever in my blood and brain urged me on to the arduous task of lopping
   </p>
   <p>
    off the huge branches; and my exertions did not cease until once more
   </p>
   <p>
    the world, with everything on it, began revolving like a whirligig,
   </p>
   <p>
    compelling me to desist and take a still longer rest. And sitting there
   </p>
   <p>
    I thought only of Yoletta. How would she look after that long seclusion?
   </p>
   <p>
    Pale, and sad too perhaps; and her sweet, soulful eyes--oh, would I now
   </p>
   <p>
    see in them that new light for which I had watched and waited so long?
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, while I thus mused, I heard, not far off, a slight rustling sound,
   </p>
   <p>
    as of a hare startled at seeing me, and bounding away over the withered
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves; and lifting up my eyes from the ground, I beheld Yoletta herself
   </p>
   <p>
    hastening towards me, her face shining with joy. I sprang forward to
   </p>
   <p>
    meet her, and in another moment she was locked in my arms. That one
   </p>
   <p>
    moment of unspeakable happiness seemed to out-weigh a hundred times all
   </p>
   <p>
    the misery I had endured. "Oh, my sweet darling--at last, at last, my
   </p>
   <p>
    pain is ended!" I murmured, while pressing her again and again to my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart, and kissing that dear face, which looked now so much thinner than
   </p>
   <p>
    when I had last seen it.
   </p>
   <p>
    She bent back her head, like Genevieve in the ballad, to look me in the
   </p>
   <p>
    face, her eyes filled with tears--crystal, happy drops, which dimmed not
   </p>
   <p>
    their brightness. But her face was pale, with a pensive pallor like that
   </p>
   <p>
    of the Gloire de Dijon rose; only now excitement had suffused her
   </p>
   <p>
    cheeks with the tints of that same rose--that red so unlike the bloom on
   </p>
   <p>
    other faces in vanished days; so tender and delicate and precious above
   </p>
   <p>
    all tints in nature!
   </p>
   <p>
    "I know," she spoke, "how you were grieving for me, that you were pale
   </p>
   <p>
    and dejected. Oh, how strange you should love me so much!"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Strange, darling--that word again! It is the one sweetness and joy of
   </p>
   <p>
    life. And are you not glad to be loved?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, I cannot tell you how glad; but am I not here in your arms to show
   </p>
   <p>
    it? When I heard that you had gone to the wood I did not wait, but ran
   </p>
   <p>
    here as fast as I could. Do you remember that evening on the hill, when
   </p>
   <p>
    you vexed me with questions, and I could not understand your words? Now,
   </p>
   <p>
    when I love you so much more, I can understand them better. Tell me,
   </p>
   <p>
    have I not done as you wished, and given myself to you, body and soul?
   </p>
   <p>
    How thirty days have changed you! Oh, Smith, do you love me so much?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I love you so much, dear, that if you were to die, there would be no
   </p>
   <p>
    more pleasure in life for me, and I should prefer to lie near you
   </p>
   <p>
    underground. All day long I am thinking of you, and when I sleep you are
   </p>
   <p>
    in all ray dreams."
   </p>
   <p>
    She still continued gazing into my face, those happy tears still shining
   </p>
   <p>
    in her eyes, listening to my words; but alas! on that sweet, beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    face, so full of changeful expression, there was not the expression I
   </p>
   <p>
    sought, and no sign of that maidenly shame which gave to Genevieve in
   </p>
   <p>
    the ballad such an exquisite grace in her lover's eyes.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I also had dreams of you," she answered. "They came to me after Edra
   </p>
   <p>
    had told me how pale and sad you had grown."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Tell me one of your dreams, darling."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I dreamed that I was lying awake on my bed, with the moon shining on
   </p>
   <p>
    me; I was cold, and crying bitterly because I had been left so long
   </p>
   <p>
    alone. All at once I saw you standing at my side in the moonlight. 'Poor
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta,' you said, 'your tears have chilled you like winter rain.' Then
   </p>
   <p>
    you kissed them dry, and when you had put your arms about me, I drew
   </p>
   <p>
    your face against my bosom, and rested warm and happy in your love."
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh, how her delicious words maddened me! Even my tongue and lips
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly became dry as ashes with the fever in me, and could only
   </p>
   <p>
    whisper huskily when I strove to answer. I released her from my arms and
   </p>
   <p>
    sat down on the fallen tree, all my blissful raptures turned to a great
   </p>
   <p>
    despondence. Would it always be thus--would she continue to embrace me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and speak words that simulated passion while no such feeling touched her
   </p>
   <p>
    heart? Such a state of things could not endure, and my passion, mocked
   </p>
   <p>
    and baffled again and again, would rend me to pieces, and hurl me on to
   </p>
   <p>
    madness and self-destruction. For how many men had been driven by love
   </p>
   <p>
    to such an end, and the women they had worshiped, and miserably died
   </p>
   <p>
    for, compared with Yoletta, were like creatures of clay compared with
   </p>
   <p>
    one of the immortals. And was she not a being of a higher order than
   </p>
   <p>
    myself? It was folly to think otherwise. But how had mortals always
   </p>
   <p>
    fared when they aspired to mate with celestials? I tried then to
   </p>
   <p>
    remember something bearing on this important point, but my mind was
   </p>
   <p>
    becoming strangely confused. I closed my eyes to think, and presently
   </p>
   <p>
    opening them again, saw Yoletta kneeling before me, gazing up into my
   </p>
   <p>
    face with an alarmed expression.
   </p>
   <p>
    "What is the matter, Smith, you seem ill?" she said; and then, laying
   </p>
   <p>
    her fresh palm on my forehead, added: "Your head burns like fire."
   </p>
   <p>
    "No wonder," I returned. "I'm worrying my brains trying to remember all
   </p>
   <p>
    about them. What were their names, and what did they do to those who
   </p>
   <p>
    loved them--can't you tell me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, you are ill--you have a fever and may die!" she exclaimed, throwing
   </p>
   <p>
    her arms about my neck and pressing her cheek to mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    I felt a strange imbecility of mind, yet it seemed to anger me to be
   </p>
   <p>
    told that I was ill. "I am not ill," I protested feebly. "I never felt
   </p>
   <p>
    better in my life! But can't you answer me--who were they, and what did
   </p>
   <p>
    they do? Tell me, or I shall go mad."
   </p>
   <p>
    She started up, and taking the small metal whistle hanging at her side,
   </p>
   <p>
    blew a shrill note that seemed to pierce my brain like a steel weapon. I
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to get up from my seat on the trunk, but only slipped down to the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground. A dull mist and gloom seemed to be settling down on everything;
   </p>
   <p>
    daylight, and hope with it, was fast forsaking the world. But something
   </p>
   <p>
    was coming to us--out of that universal mist and darkness closing around
   </p>
   <p>
    us it came bounding swiftly through the wood--a huge gray wolf! No, not
   </p>
   <p>
    a wolf--a wolf was nothing to it! A mighty, roaring lion crashing
   </p>
   <p>
    through the forest; a monster ever increasing in size, vast and of
   </p>
   <p>
    horrible aspect, surpassing all monsters of the imagination--all beasts,
   </p>
   <p>
    gigantic and deformed, that had ever existed in past geologic ages; a
   </p>
   <p>
    lion with teeth like elephants' tusks, its head clothed as with a black
   </p>
   <p>
    thunder-cloud, through which its eyes glared like twin, blood-red suns!
   </p>
   <p>
    And she--my love--with a cry on her lips, was springing forth to meet
   </p>
   <p>
    it--lost, lost for ever! I struggled frantically to rise and fly to her
   </p>
   <p>
    assistance, and rose, after many efforts, to my knees, only to fall
   </p>
   <p>
    again to the earth, insensible.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 16
   </p>
   <p>
    The violent fever into which I had fallen did not abate until the third
   </p>
   <p>
    day, when I fell into a profound slumber, from which I woke refreshed
   </p>
   <p>
    and saved. I did not, on awakening, find myself in my own familiar cell,
   </p>
   <p>
    but in a spacious apartment new to me, on a comfortable bed, beside
   </p>
   <p>
    which Edra was seated. Almost my first feeling was one of disappointment
   </p>
   <p>
    at not seeing Yoletta there, and presently I began to fear that in the
   </p>
   <p>
    ravings of delirium I had spoken things which had plucked the scales
   </p>
   <p>
    from the eyes of my kind friends in a very rough way indeed, and that
   </p>
   <p>
    the being I loved best had been permanently withdrawn from my sight. It
   </p>
   <p>
    was a blessed relief when Edra, in answer to the questions I put with
   </p>
   <p>
    some heart-quakings to her, informed me that I had talked a great deal
   </p>
   <p>
    in my fever, but unintelligibly, continually asking questions about
   </p>
   <p>
    Venus, Diana, Juno, and many other persons whose names had never before
   </p>
   <p>
    been heard in the house. How fortunate that my crazy brain had thus
   </p>
   <p>
    continued vexing itself with this idle question! She also told me that
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta had watched day and night at my side, that at last, when the
   </p>
   <p>
    fever left me, and I had fallen into that cooling slumber, she too, with
   </p>
   <p>
    her hand on mine, had dropped her head on the pillow and fallen asleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, without waking her, they had carried her away to her own room, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Edra had taken her place by my side.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Have you nothing more to ask?" she said at length, with an accent of
   </p>
   <p>
    surprise.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No; nothing more. What you have told me has made me very happy--what
   </p>
   <p>
    more can I wish to know?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "But there is more to tell you, Smith. We know now that your illness is
   </p>
   <p>
    the result of your own imprudence; and as soon as you are well enough to
   </p>
   <p>
    leave your room and bear it, you must suffer the punishment."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What! Punished for being ill!" I exclaimed, sitting bolt upright in my
   </p>
   <p>
    bed. "What do you mean, Edra? I never heard such outrageous nonsense in
   </p>
   <p>
    my life!"
   </p>
   <p>
    She was disturbed at this outburst, but quietly and gravely repeated
   </p>
   <p>
    that I must certainly be punished for my illness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Remembering what their punishments were, I had the prospect of a second
   </p>
   <p>
    long separation from Yoletta, and the thought of such excessive
   </p>
   <p>
    severity, or rather of such cruel injustice, made me wild. "By Heaven, I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall not submit to it!" I exclaimed. "Punished for being ill--who ever
   </p>
   <p>
    heard of such a thing! I suppose that by-and-by it will be discovered
   </p>
   <p>
    that the bridge of my nose is not quite straight, or that I can't see
   </p>
   <p>
    round the corner, and that also will be set down as a crime, to be
   </p>
   <p>
    expiated in solitary confinement, on a bread-and-water diet! No, you
   </p>
   <p>
    shall not punish me; rather than give in to such tyranny I'll walk off
   </p>
   <p>
    and leave the house for ever!"
   </p>
   <p>
    She regarded me with an expression almost approaching to horror on her
   </p>
   <p>
    gentle face, and for some moments made no reply. Then I remembered that
   </p>
   <p>
    if I carried out that insane threat I should indeed lose Yoletta, and
   </p>
   <p>
    the very thought of such a loss was more than I could endure; and for a
   </p>
   <p>
    moment I almost hated the love which made me so helpless and
   </p>
   <p>
    miserable--so powerless to oppose their stupid and barbarous practices.
   </p>
   <p>
    It would have been sweet then to have felt free--free to fling them a
   </p>
   <p>
    curse, and go away, shaking the dust of their house from my shoes,
   </p>
   <p>
    supposing that any dust had adhered to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then Edra began to speak again, and gravely and sorrowfully, but without
   </p>
   <p>
    a touch of austerity in her tone or manner, censured me for making use
   </p>
   <p>
    of such irrational language, and for allowing bitter, resentful thoughts
   </p>
   <p>
    to enter my heart. But the despondence and sullen rage into which I had
   </p>
   <p>
    been thrown made me proof even against the medicine of an admonition
   </p>
   <p>
    imparted so gently, and, turning my face away, I stubbornly refused to
   </p>
   <p>
    make any reply. For a while she was silent, but I misjudged her when I
   </p>
   <p>
    imagined that she would now leave me, offended, to my own reflections.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you not know that you are giving me pain?" she said at last, drawing
   </p>
   <p>
    a little closer to me. "A little while ago you told me that you loved
   </p>
   <p>
    me: has that feeling faded so soon, or do you take any pleasure in
   </p>
   <p>
    wounding those you love?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Her words, and, more than her words, her tender, pleading tone, pierced
   </p>
   <p>
    me with compunction, and I could not resist. "Edra, my sweet sister, do
   </p>
   <p>
    not imagine such a thing!" I said. "I would rather endure many
   </p>
   <p>
    punishments than give you pain. My love for you cannot fade while I have
   </p>
   <p>
    life and understanding. It is in me like greenness in the leaf--that
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful color which can only be changed by sere decay."
   </p>
   <p>
    She smiled forgiveness, and with a humid brightness in her eyes, which
   </p>
   <p>
    somehow made me think of that joy of the angels over one sinner that
   </p>
   <p>
    repenteth, bent down and touched her lips to mine. "How can you love any
   </p>
   <p>
    one more than that, Smith?" she said. "Yet you say that your love for
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta exceeds all others."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, dear, exceeds all others, as the light of the sun exceeds that of
   </p>
   <p>
    the moon and the stars. Can you not understand that--has no man ever
   </p>
   <p>
    loved you with a love like that, my sister?"
   </p>
   <p>
    She shook her head and sighed. Did she not understand my meaning
   </p>
   <p>
    now--had not my words brought back some sweet and sorrowful memory? With
   </p>
   <p>
    her hands folded idly on her lap, and her face half averted, she sat
   </p>
   <p>
    gazing at nothing. It seemed impossible that this woman, so tender and
   </p>
   <p>
    so beautiful, should never have experienced in herself or witnessed in
   </p>
   <p>
    another, the feeling I had questioned her about. But she made no further
   </p>
   <p>
    reply to my words; and as I lay there watching her, the drowsy spirit
   </p>
   <p>
    the fever had left in me overcame my brain, and I slept once more.
   </p>
   <p>
    For several days, which brought me so little strength that I was not
   </p>
   <p>
    permitted to leave the sick-room, I heard nothing further about my
   </p>
   <p>
    punishment, for I purposely refrained from asking any questions, and no
   </p>
   <p>
    person appeared inclined to bring forward so disagreeable a subject. At
   </p>
   <p>
    length I was pronounced well enough to go about the house, although
   </p>
   <p>
    still very feeble, and I was conducted, not to the judgment-room, where
   </p>
   <p>
    I had expected to be taken, but to the Mother's Room; and there I found
   </p>
   <p>
    the father of the house, seated with Chastel, and with them seven or
   </p>
   <p>
    eight of the others. They all welcomed me, and seemed glad to see me out
   </p>
   <p>
    again; but I could not help remarking a certain subdued, almost solemn
   </p>
   <p>
    air about them, which seemed to remind me that I was regarded as an
   </p>
   <p>
    offender already found guilty, who had now been brought up to receive
   </p>
   <p>
    judgment.
   </p>
   <p>
    "My son," said the father, addressing me in a calm, judicial tone which
   </p>
   <p>
    at once put my last remaining hopes to flight, "it is a consolation to
   </p>
   <p>
    us to know that your offense is of such a nature that it cannot diminish
   </p>
   <p>
    our esteem for you, or loosen the bonds of affection which unite you to
   </p>
   <p>
    us. You are still feeble, and perhaps a little confused in mind
   </p>
   <p>
    concerning the events of the last few days: I do not therefore press you
   </p>
   <p>
    to give an account of them, but shall simply state your offense, and if
   </p>
   <p>
    I am mistaken in any particular you shall correct me. The great love you
   </p>
   <p>
    have for Yoletta," he continued--and at this I started and blushed
   </p>
   <p>
    painfully, but the succeeding words served to show that I had only too
   </p>
   <p>
    little cause for alarm--"the great love you have for Yoletta caused you
   </p>
   <p>
    much suffering during her thirty days' seclusion from us, so that you
   </p>
   <p>
    lost all enjoyment of life, and eating little, and being in continual
   </p>
   <p>
    dejection, your strength was much diminished. On the last day you were
   </p>
   <p>
    so much excited at the prospect of reunion with her, that you went to
   </p>
   <p>
    your task in the woods almost fasting, and probably after spending a
   </p>
   <p>
    restless night. Tell me if this is not so?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "I did not sleep that night," I replied, somewhat huskily.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Unrefreshed by sleep and with lessened strength," he continued, "you
   </p>
   <p>
    went to the woods, and in order to allay that excitement in your mind,
   </p>
   <p>
    you labored with such energy that by noon you had accomplished a task
   </p>
   <p>
    which, in another and calmer condition of mind and body, would have
   </p>
   <p>
    occupied you more than one day. In thus acting you had already been
   </p>
   <p>
    guilty of a serious offense against yourself; but even then you might
   </p>
   <p>
    have escaped the consequences if, after finishing your work, you had
   </p>
   <p>
    rested and refreshed yourself with food and drink. This, however, you
   </p>
   <p>
    neglected to do; for when you had fallen insensible to the earth, and
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta had called the dog and sent it to the house to summon
   </p>
   <p>
    assistance, the food you had taken with you was found untasted in the
   </p>
   <p>
    basket. Your life was thus placed in great peril; and although it is
   </p>
   <p>
    good to lay life down when it has become a burden to ourselves and
   </p>
   <p>
    others, being darkened by that failure of power from which there is no
   </p>
   <p>
    recovery, wantonly or carelessly to endanger it in the flower of its
   </p>
   <p>
    strength and beauty is a great folly and a great offense. Consider how
   </p>
   <p>
    deep our grief would have been, especially the grief of Yoletta, if this
   </p>
   <p>
    culpable disregard of your own safety and well-being had ended fatally,
   </p>
   <p>
    as it came so near ending! It is therefore just and righteous that an
   </p>
   <p>
    offense of such a nature should be recompensed; but it is a light
   </p>
   <p>
    offense, not like one committed against the house, or even against
   </p>
   <p>
    another person, and we also remember the occasion of it, since it was no
   </p>
   <p>
    unworthy motive, but exceeding love, which clouded your judgment, and
   </p>
   <p>
    therefore, taking all these things into account, it was my intention to
   </p>
   <p>
    put you away from us for the space of thirteen days."
   </p>
   <p>
    Here he paused, as if expecting me to make some reply. He had reproved
   </p>
   <p>
    me so gently, even approving of the emotion, although still entirely in
   </p>
   <p>
    the dark as to its meaning, which had caused my illness, that I was made
   </p>
   <p>
    to feel very submissive, and even grateful to him.
   </p>
   <p>
    "It is only just," I replied, "that I should suffer for my fault, and
   </p>
   <p>
    you have tempered justice with more mercy than I deserve."
   </p>
   <p>
    "You speak with the wisdom of a chastened spirit, my son," he said,
   </p>
   <p>
    rising and placing his hand on my head; "and your words gladden me all
   </p>
   <p>
    the more for knowing that you were filled with surprise and resentment
   </p>
   <p>
    when told that your offense was one deserving punishment. And now, my
   </p>
   <p>
    son, I have to tell you that you will not be separated from us, for the
   </p>
   <p>
    mother of the house has willed that your offense shall be pardoned."
   </p>
   <p>
    I looked in surprise at Chastel, for this was very unexpected: she was
   </p>
   <p>
    gazing at my face with the light of a strange tenderness in her eyes,
   </p>
   <p>
    never seen there before. She extended her hand, and, kneeling before
   </p>
   <p>
    her, I took it in mine and raised it to my lips, and tried, with poor
   </p>
   <p>
    success, to speak my thanks for this rare and beautiful act of mercy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then the others surrounded me to express their congratulations, the men
   </p>
   <p>
    pressing my hands, but not so the women, for they all freely kissed me;
   </p>
   <p>
    but when Yoletta, coming last, put her white arms about my neck and
   </p>
   <p>
    pressed her lips to mine, the ecstasy I felt was so greatly overbalanced
   </p>
   <p>
    by the pain of my position, and the thought, now almost a conviction,
   </p>
   <p>
    that I was powerless to enlighten them with regard to the nature of the
   </p>
   <p>
    love I felt for her, that I almost shrank from her dear embrace.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 17
   </p>
   <p>
    My attack of illness, although sharp, had passed off so quickly that I
   </p>
   <p>
    confidently looked to complete restoration to my former vigorous state
   </p>
   <p>
    of health in a very short time. Nevertheless, many days went by, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    failed to recover strength, but remained pretty much in that condition
   </p>
   <p>
    of body in which I had quitted the sick-room. This surprised and
   </p>
   <p>
    distressed me at first, but in a little time I began to get reconciled
   </p>
   <p>
    to such a state, and even to discover that it had certain advantages,
   </p>
   <p>
    the chief of which was that the tumult of my mind was over for a season,
   </p>
   <p>
    so that I craved for nothing very eagerly. My friends advised me to do
   </p>
   <p>
    no work; but not wishing to eat the bread of idleness--although the
   </p>
   <p>
    bread was little now, as I had little appetite--I made it a rule to go
   </p>
   <p>
    every morning to the workhouse, and occupy myself for two or three hours
   </p>
   <p>
    with some light, mechanical task which put no strain on me, physical or
   </p>
   <p>
    mental. Even this playing at work fatigued me. Then, after changing my
   </p>
   <p>
    dress, I would repair to the music-room to resume my search after hidden
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge in any books that happened to be there; for I could read now,
   </p>
   <p>
    a result which my sweet schoolmistress had been the first to see, and at
   </p>
   <p>
    once she had abandoned the lessons I had loved so much, leaving me to
   </p>
   <p>
    wander at will, but without a guide, in that wilderness of a strange
   </p>
   <p>
    literature. I had never been to the library, and did not even know in
   </p>
   <p>
    what part of the house it was situated; nor had I ever expressed a wish
   </p>
   <p>
    to see it. And that for two reasons: one was, that I had already
   </p>
   <p>
    half-resolved--my resolutions were usually of that complexion--never to
   </p>
   <p>
    run the risk of appearing desirous of knowing too much; the other and
   </p>
   <p>
    weightier reason was, that I had never loved libraries. They oppress me
   </p>
   <p>
    with a painful sense of my mental inferiority; for all those tens of
   </p>
   <p>
    thousands of volumes, containing so much important but unappreciated
   </p>
   <p>
    matter, seem to have a kind of collective existence, and to look down on
   </p>
   <p>
    me, like a man with great, staring, owlish eyes, as an intruder on
   </p>
   <p>
    sacred ground--a barbarian, whose proper place is in the woods. It is a
   </p>
   <p>
    mere fancy, I know, but it distresses me, and I prefer not to put myself
   </p>
   <p>
    in the way of it. Once in a book I met with a scornful passage about
   </p>
   <p>
    people with "bodily constitutions like those of horses, and small
   </p>
   <p>
    brains," which made me blush painfully; but in the very next passage the
   </p>
   <p>
    writer makes amends, saying that a man ought to think himself well off
   </p>
   <p>
    if, in the lottery of life, he draws the prize of a healthy stomach
   </p>
   <p>
    without a mind, that it is better than a fine intellect with a crazy
   </p>
   <p>
    stomach. I had drawn the healthy stomach--liver, lungs, and heart to
   </p>
   <p>
    match--and had never felt dissatisfied with my prize. Now, however, it
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed expedient that I should give some hours each day to reading; for
   </p>
   <p>
    so far my conversations and close intimacy with the people of the house
   </p>
   <p>
    had not dissipated the cloud of mystery in which their customs were hid;
   </p>
   <p>
    and by customs I here refer to those relating to courtship and matrimony
   </p>
   <p>
    only, for that was to me the main thing. The books I read, or dipped
   </p>
   <p>
    into, were all highly interesting, especially the odd volumes I looked
   </p>
   <p>
    at belonging to that long series on the Houses of the World, for
   </p>
   <p>
    these abounded in marvelous and entertaining matter. There were also
   </p>
   <p>
    histories of the house, and works on arts, agriculture, and various
   </p>
   <p>
    other subjects, but they were not what I wanted. After three or four
   </p>
   <p>
    hours spent in these fruitless researches, I would proceed to the
   </p>
   <p>
    Mother's Room, where I was now permitted to enter freely every
   </p>
   <p>
    afternoon, and when there, to remain as long as I wished. It was so
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant that I soon dropped into the custom of remaining until
   </p>
   <p>
    supper-time compelled me to leave it, Chastel invariably treating me now
   </p>
   <p>
    with a loving tenderness of manner which seemed strange when I recalled
   </p>
   <p>
    the extremely unfavorable impression I had made at our first interview.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was never my nature to be indolent, or to love a quiet, dreamy
   </p>
   <p>
    existence: on the contrary, my fault had lain in the opposite direction,
   </p>
   <p>
    unlimited muscular exercise being as necessary to my well-being as fresh
   </p>
   <p>
    air and good food, and the rougher the exercise the better I liked it.
   </p>
   <p>
    But now, in this novel condition of languor, I experienced a wonderful
   </p>
   <p>
    restfulness both of body and mind, and in the Mother's Room, resting as
   </p>
   <p>
    if some weariness of labor still clung to me, breathing and steeped in
   </p>
   <p>
    that fragrant, summer-like atmosphere, I had long intervals of perfect
   </p>
   <p>
    inactivity and silence, while I sat or reclined, not thinking but in a
   </p>
   <p>
    reverie, while many dreams of pleasures to come drifted in a vague,
   </p>
   <p>
    vaporous manner through my brain. The very character of the room--its
   </p>
   <p>
    delicate richness, the exquisitely harmonious disposition of colors and
   </p>
   <p>
    objects, and the illusions of nature produced on the mind--seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    lend itself to this unaccustomed mood, and to confirm me in it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first impression produced was one of brightness: coming to it by way
   </p>
   <p>
    of the long, dim sculpture gallery was like passing out into the open
   </p>
   <p>
    air, and this effect was partly due to the white and crystal surfaces
   </p>
   <p>
    and the brilliancy of the colors where any color appeared. It was
   </p>
   <p>
    spacious and lofty, and the central arched or domed portion of the roof,
   </p>
   <p>
    which was of a light turquoise blue, rested on graceful columns of
   </p>
   <p>
    polished crystal. The doors were of amber-colored glass set in agate
   </p>
   <p>
    frames; but the windows, eight in number, formed the principal
   </p>
   <p>
    attraction. On the glass, hill and mountain scenery was depicted, the
   </p>
   <p>
    summits in some of them appearing beyond wide, barren plains, whitened
   </p>
   <p>
    with the noonday splendor and heat of midsummer, untempered by a cloud,
   </p>
   <p>
    the soaring peaks showing a pearly luster which seemed to remove them to
   </p>
   <p>
    an infinite distance. To look out, as it were, from the imitation shade
   </p>
   <p>
    of such an arbor, or pavilion, over those far-off, sun-lit expanses
   </p>
   <p>
    where the light appeared to dance and quiver as one gazed, was a
   </p>
   <p>
    never-failing delight. Such was its effect on me, combined with that of
   </p>
   <p>
    the mother's new tender graciousness, resulting I knew not whether from
   </p>
   <p>
    compassion or affection, that I could have wished to remain a permanent
   </p>
   <p>
    invalid in her room.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another cause of the mild kind of happiness I now experienced was the
   </p>
   <p>
    consciousness of a change in my own mental disposition, which made me
   </p>
   <p>
    less of an alien in the house; for I was now able, I imagined, to
   </p>
   <p>
    appreciate the beautiful character of my friends, their crystal purity
   </p>
   <p>
    of heart and the religion they professed. Far back in the old days I had
   </p>
   <p>
    heard, first and last, a great deal about sweetness and light and
   </p>
   <p>
    Philistines, and not quite knowing what this grand question was all
   </p>
   <p>
    about, and hearing from some of my friends that I was without the
   </p>
   <p>
    qualities they valued most, I thereafter proclaimed myself a Philistine,
   </p>
   <p>
    and was satisfied to have the controversy ended in that way, so far as
   </p>
   <p>
    it concerned me personally. Now, however, I was like one to whom some
   </p>
   <p>
    important thing has been told, who, scarcely hearing and straightway
   </p>
   <p>
    forgetting, goes about his affairs; but, lying awake at night in the
   </p>
   <p>
    silence of his chamber, recalls the unheeded words and perceives their
   </p>
   <p>
    full significance. My sojourn with this people--angelic women and
   </p>
   <p>
    mild-eyed men with downy, unrazored lips, so mild in manner yet in their
   </p>
   <p>
    arts "laying broad bases for eternity"--above all the invalid hours
   </p>
   <p>
    spent daily in the Mother's Room, had taught me how unlovely a creature
   </p>
   <p>
    I had been. It would have been strange indeed if, in such an atmosphere,
   </p>
   <p>
    I had not absorbed a little sweetness and light into my system.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this sweet refuge--this slumberous valley where I had been cast up by
   </p>
   <p>
    that swift black current that had borne me to an immeasurable distance
   </p>
   <p>
    on its bosom, and with such a change going on within me--I sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    thought that a little more and I would touch that serene, enduring bliss
   </p>
   <p>
    which seemed to be the normal condition of my fellow-inmates. My passion
   </p>
   <p>
    for Yoletta now burned with a gentle flame, which did not consume, but
   </p>
   <p>
    only imparted an agreeable sense of warmth to the system. When she was
   </p>
   <p>
    there, sitting with me at her mother's feet, sometimes so near that her
   </p>
   <p>
    dark, shining hair brushed against my cheek, and her fragrant breath
   </p>
   <p>
    came on my face; and when she caressed my hand, and gazed full at me
   </p>
   <p>
    with those dear eyes that had no shadow of regret or anxiety in them,
   </p>
   <p>
    but only unfathomable love, I could imagine that our union was already
   </p>
   <p>
    complete, that she was altogether and eternally mine.
   </p>
   <p>
    I knew that this could not continue. Sometimes I could not prevent my
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts from flying away from the present; then suddenly the complexion
   </p>
   <p>
    of my dream would change, darkening like a fair landscape when a cloud
   </p>
   <p>
    obscures the sun. Not forever would the demon of passion slumber and
   </p>
   <p>
    dream in my breast; with recovered strength it would wake again, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    ever increasing in power and ever baffled of its desire, would raise
   </p>
   <p>
    once more that black tempest of that past to overwhelm me. Other darker
   </p>
   <p>
    visions followed: I would see myself as in a magic glass, lying with
   </p>
   <p>
    upturned, ghastly face, with many people about me, hurrying to and fro,
   </p>
   <p>
    wringing their hands and weeping aloud with grief, shuddering at the
   </p>
   <p>
    abhorred sight of blood on their sacred, shining floors; or, worse
   </p>
   <p>
    still, I saw myself shivering in sordid rags and gaunt with long-lasting
   </p>
   <p>
    famine, a fugitive in some wintry, desolate land, far from all human
   </p>
   <p>
    companionship, the very image of Yoletta scorched by madness to formless
   </p>
   <p>
    ashes in my brain; and for all sensations, feelings, memories, thoughts,
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing left to me but a distorted likeness of the visible world, and a
   </p>
   <p>
    terrible unrest urging me, as with a whip of scorpions, ever on and on,
   </p>
   <p>
    to ford yet other black, icy torrents, and tear myself bleeding through
   </p>
   <p>
    yet other thorny thickets, and climb the ramparts of yet other gigantic,
   </p>
   <p>
    barren hills.
   </p>
   <p>
    But these moments of terrible depression, new to my life, were
   </p>
   <p>
    infrequent, and seldom lasted long. Chastel was my good angel; a word, a
   </p>
   <p>
    touch from her hand, and the ugly spirits would vanish. She appeared to
   </p>
   <p>
    possess a mysterious faculty--perhaps only the keen insight and sympathy
   </p>
   <p>
    of a highly spiritualized nature--which informed her of much that was
   </p>
   <p>
    passing in my heart: if a shadow came there when she had no wish or
   </p>
   <p>
    strength to converse, she would make me draw close to her seat, and rest
   </p>
   <p>
    her hand on mine, and the shadow would pass from me.
   </p>
   <p>
    I could not help reflecting often and wonderingly at this great change
   </p>
   <p>
    in her manner towards me. Her eyes dwelt lovingly on me, and her keenest
   </p>
   <p>
    suffering, and the unfortunate blundering expressions I frequently let
   </p>
   <p>
    fall, seemed equally powerless to wring one harsh or impatient word from
   </p>
   <p>
    her. I was not now only one among her children, privileged to come and
   </p>
   <p>
    sit at her feet, to have with them a share in her impartial affection;
   </p>
   <p>
    and remembering that I was a stranger in the house, and compared but
   </p>
   <p>
    poorly with the others, the undisguised preference she showed for me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and the wish to have me almost constantly with her, seemed a great
   </p>
   <p>
    mystery.
   </p>
   <p>
    One afternoon, as I sat alone with her, she made the remark that my
   </p>
   <p>
    reading lessons had ceased.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh yes, I can read perfectly well now," I answered. "May I read to you
   </p>
   <p>
    from this book?" Saying which, I put my hand towards a volume lying on
   </p>
   <p>
    the couch at her side. It differed from the other books I had seen, in
   </p>
   <p>
    its smaller size and blue binding.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, not in this book," she said, with a shade of annoyance in her
   </p>
   <p>
    voice, putting out her hand to prevent my taking it.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Have I made another mistake?" I asked, withdrawing my hand. "I am very
   </p>
   <p>
    ignorant."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, poor boy, you are very ignorant," she returned, placing her hand
   </p>
   <p>
    on my forehead. "You must know that this is a mother's book, and only a
   </p>
   <p>
    mother may read in it."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I am afraid," I said, with a sigh, "that it will be a long time before
   </p>
   <p>
    I cease to offend you with such mistakes."
   </p>
   <p>
    "There is no occasion to say that, for you have not offended me, only
   </p>
   <p>
    you make me feel sorry. Every day when you are with me I try to teach
   </p>
   <p>
    you something, to smooth the path for you; but you must remember, my
   </p>
   <p>
    son, that others cannot feel towards you as I do, and it may come to
   </p>
   <p>
    pass that they will sometimes be offended with you, because their love
   </p>
   <p>
    is less than mine."
   </p>
   <p>
    "But why do you care so much for me?" I asked, emboldened by her words.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Once I thought that you only of all in the house would never love me:
   </p>
   <p>
    what has changed your feelings towards me, for I know that they have
   </p>
   <p>
    changed?" She looked at me, smiling a little sadly, but did not reply.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I think I should be happier for knowing," I resumed, caressing her
   </p>
   <p>
    hand. "Will you not tell me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a strange trouble on her face as her eyes glanced away and
   </p>
   <p>
    then returned to mine again, while her lips quivered, as if with
   </p>
   <p>
    unspoken words. Then she answered: "No, I cannot tell you now. It would
   </p>
   <p>
    make you happy, perhaps, but the proper time has not yet arrived. You
   </p>
   <p>
    must be patient, and learn, for you have much to learn. It is my desire
   </p>
   <p>
    that you should know all those things concerning the family of which you
   </p>
   <p>
    are ignorant, and when I say all, I mean not only those suitable to one
   </p>
   <p>
    in your present condition, as a son of the house, but also those higher
   </p>
   <p>
    matters which belong to the heads of the house--to the father and
   </p>
   <p>
    mother."
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, casting away all caution, I answered: "It is precisely a knowledge
   </p>
   <p>
    of those greater matters concerning the family which I have been
   </p>
   <p>
    hungering after ever since I came into the house."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I know it," she returned. "This hunger you speak of was partly the
   </p>
   <p>
    cause of your fever, and it is in you, keeping you feverish and feeble
   </p>
   <p>
    still; but for this, instead of being a prisoner here, you would now be
   </p>
   <p>
    abroad, feeling the sun and wind on your face."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And if you know that," I pleaded, "why do you not now impart the
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge that can make me whole? For surely, all those lesser
   </p>
   <p>
    matters--those things suitable for one in my condition to know--can be
   </p>
   <p>
    learned afterwards, in due time. For they are not of pressing
   </p>
   <p>
    importance, but the other is to me a matter of life and death, if you
   </p>
   <p>
    only knew it."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I know everything," she returned quickly. But a cloud had come over her
   </p>
   <p>
    face at my concluding words, and a startled look into her eyes. "Life
   </p>
   <p>
    and death! do you know what you are saying?" she exclaimed, fixing her
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes on me with such intense earnestness in them that mine fell abashed
   </p>
   <p>
    before their gaze. Then, after a while, she drew my head down against
   </p>
   <p>
    her knees, and spoke with a strange tenderness. "Do you then find it so
   </p>
   <p>
    hard to exercise a little patience, my son, that you do not acquiesce in
   </p>
   <p>
    what I say to you, and fear to trust your future in my hands? My time is
   </p>
   <p>
    short for all that I have to do, yet I also must be patient and wait,
   </p>
   <p>
    although for me it is hardest. For now your coming, which I did not
   </p>
   <p>
    regard at first, seeing in you only a pilgrim like others--one who
   </p>
   <p>
    through accidents of travel had been cast away and left homeless in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, until we found and gave you shelter--now, it has brought
   </p>
   <p>
    something new into my life: and if this fresh hope, which is only an
   </p>
   <p>
    old, perished hope born again, ever finds fulfillment, then death will
   </p>
   <p>
    lose much of its bitterness. But there are difficulties in the way which
   </p>
   <p>
    only time, and the energy of a soul that centers all its faculties in
   </p>
   <p>
    one desire, one enterprise, can overcome. And the chief difficulty I
   </p>
   <p>
    find is in yourself--in that strange, untoward disposition so often
   </p>
   <p>
    revealed in your conversation, which you have shown even now; for to be
   </p>
   <p>
    thus questioned and pressed, and to have my judgment doubted, would have
   </p>
   <p>
    greatly offended me in another. Remember this, and do not abuse the
   </p>
   <p>
    privilege you enjoy: remember that you must greatly change before I can
   </p>
   <p>
    share with you the secrets of my heart that concern you. And bear in
   </p>
   <p>
    mind, my son, that I am not rebuking you for a want of knowledge; for I
   </p>
   <p>
    know that for many deficiencies you are not blameworthy. I know, for
   </p>
   <p>
    instance, that nature has denied to you that melodious and flexible
   </p>
   <p>
    voice in which it is our custom every day to render homage to the
   </p>
   <p>
    Father, to express all the sacred feelings of our hearts, all our love
   </p>
   <p>
    for each other, the joy we have in life, and even our griefs and
   </p>
   <p>
    sorrows. For grief is like a dark, oppressive cloud, until from lip and
   </p>
   <p>
    hand it breaks in the rain of melody, and we are lightened, so that even
   </p>
   <p>
    the things that are painful give to life a new and chastened glory. And
   </p>
   <p>
    as with music, so with all other arts. There is a twofold pleasure in
   </p>
   <p>
    contemplating our Father's works: in the first and lower kind you share
   </p>
   <p>
    with us; but the second and more noble, springing from the first, is
   </p>
   <p>
    ours through that faculty by means of which the beauty and harmony of
   </p>
   <p>
    the visible world become transmuted in the soul, which is like a pencil
   </p>
   <p>
    of glass receiving the white sunbeam into itself, and changing it to
   </p>
   <p>
    red, green, and violet-colored light: thus nature transmutes itself in
   </p>
   <p>
    our minds, and is expressed in art. But in you this second faculty is
   </p>
   <p>
    wanting, else you would not willingly forego so great a pleasure as its
   </p>
   <p>
    exercise affords, and love nature like one that loves his fellow-man,
   </p>
   <p>
    but has no words to express so sweet a feeling. For the happiness of
   </p>
   <p>
    love with sympathy, when made known and returned, is increased an
   </p>
   <p>
    hundredfold; and in all artistic work we commune not with blind,
   </p>
   <p>
    irrational nature, but with the unseen spirit which is in nature,
   </p>
   <p>
    inspiring our hearts, returning love for love, and rewarding our labor
   </p>
   <p>
    with enduring bliss. Therefore it is your misfortune, not your fault,
   </p>
   <p>
    that you are deprived of this supreme solace and happiness."
   </p>
   <p>
    To this speech, which had a depressing effect on me, I answered sadly:
   </p>
   <p>
    "Every day I feel my deficiencies more keenly, and wish more ardently to
   </p>
   <p>
    lessen the great distance between us; but now--sweet mother, forgive me
   </p>
   <p>
    for saying it!--your words almost make me despond."
   </p>
   <p>
    "And yet, my son, I have spoken only to encourage you. I know your
   </p>
   <p>
    limitations, and expect nothing beyond your powers; nor do your errors
   </p>
   <p>
    greatly trouble me, believing as I do that in time you will be able to
   </p>
   <p>
    dismiss them from your mind. But the temper of your mind must be changed
   </p>
   <p>
    to be worthy of the happiness I have designed for you. Patience must
   </p>
   <p>
    chasten that reckless spirit in you; for feverish diligence, alternating
   </p>
   <p>
    with indifference or despondence, there must be unremitting effort; and
   </p>
   <p>
    for that unsteady flame of hope, which burns so brightly in the morning
   </p>
   <p>
    and in the evening sings so low, there must be a bright, unwavering, and
   </p>
   <p>
    rational hope. It would be strange indeed if after this you were cast
   </p>
   <p>
    down; and, lest you forget anything, I will say again that only by
   </p>
   <p>
    giving you enduring happiness and the desire of your heart can my one
   </p>
   <p>
    hope be fulfilled. Consider how much I say to you in these words; it
   </p>
   <p>
    saddens me to think that so much was necessary. And do not think hardly
   </p>
   <p>
    of me, my son, for wishing to keep you a little longer in this prison
   </p>
   <p>
    with me: for in a little while your weakness will pass away like a
   </p>
   <p>
    morning cloud. But for me there shall come no change, since I must
   </p>
   <p>
    remain day and night here with the shadow of death; and when I am taken
   </p>
   <p>
    forth, and the sunshine falls once more on my face, I shall not feel it,
   </p>
   <p>
    and shall not see it, and I shall lie forgotten when you are in the
   </p>
   <p>
    midst of your happy years."
   </p>
   <p>
    Her words smote on my heart with a keen pain of compassion. "Do not say
   </p>
   <p>
    that you will be forgotten!" I exclaimed passionately; "for should you
   </p>
   <p>
    be taken away, I shall still love and worship your memory, as I worship
   </p>
   <p>
    you now when you are alive."
   </p>
   <p>
    She caressed my hand, but did not speak; and when I looked up, her worn
   </p>
   <p>
    face had dropped on the pillow, and her eyes were closed. "I am
   </p>
   <p>
    tired--tired," she murmured. "Stay with me a little longer, but leave me
   </p>
   <p>
    if I sleep."
   </p>
   <p>
    And in a little while she slept. The light was on her face, resting on
   </p>
   <p>
    the purple pillow, and with the soulful eyes closed, and the lips that
   </p>
   <p>
    had no red color of life in them also closed and motionless, it was like
   </p>
   <p>
    a face carved in ivory of one who had suffered like Isarte in the house
   </p>
   <p>
    and perished long generations ago; and the abundant dark, lusterless
   </p>
   <p>
    hair that framed it, looked dead too, and of the color of wrought iron.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 18
   </p>
   <p>
    Chastel's words sank deep in my heart--deeper than words had ever sunk
   </p>
   <p>
    before into that somewhat unpromising soil; and although she had
   </p>
   <p>
    purposely left me in the dark with regard to many important matters, I
   </p>
   <p>
    now resolved to win her esteem, and bind her yet more closely to me by
   </p>
   <p>
    correcting those faults in my character she had pointed out with so much
   </p>
   <p>
    tenderness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Alas! the very next day was destined to bring me a sore trouble. On
   </p>
   <p>
    entering the breakfast-room I became aware that a shadow had fallen on
   </p>
   <p>
    the house. Among his silent people the father sat with gray, haggard
   </p>
   <p>
    face and troubled eyes; then Yoletta entered, her sweet face looking
   </p>
   <p>
    paler than when I had first seen it after her long punishment, while
   </p>
   <p>
    under her heavy, drooping eyelids her skin was stained with that
   </p>
   <p>
    mournful purple which tells of a long vigil and a heart oppressed with
   </p>
   <p>
    anxiety. I heard with profound concern that Chastel's malady had
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly become aggravated; that she had passed the night in the
   </p>
   <p>
    greatest suffering. What would become of me, and of all those bright
   </p>
   <p>
    dreams of happiness, if she were to die? was my first idea. But at the
   </p>
   <p>
    same time I had the grace to feel ashamed of that selfish thought.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nevertheless, I could not shake off the gloom it had produced in me,
   </p>
   <p>
    and, too distressed in mind to work or read, I repaired to the Mother's
   </p>
   <p>
    Room, to be as near as possible to the sufferer on whose recovery so
   </p>
   <p>
    much now depended. How lonely and desolate it seemed there, now that she
   </p>
   <p>
    was absent! Those mountain landscapes, glowing with the white radiance
   </p>
   <p>
    of mimic sunshine, still made perpetual summer; yet there seemed to be a
   </p>
   <p>
    wintry chill and death-like atmosphere which struck to the heart, and
   </p>
   <p>
    made me shiver with cold. The day dragged slowly to its close, and no
   </p>
   <p>
    rest came to the sufferer, nor sign of improvement to relieve our
   </p>
   <p>
    anxiety. Until past midnight I remained at my post, then retired for
   </p>
   <p>
    three or four miserable, anxious hours, only to return once more when it
   </p>
   <p>
    was scarcely light. Chastel's condition was still unchanged, or, if
   </p>
   <p>
    there had been any change, it was for the worse, for she had not slept.
   </p>
   <p>
    Again I remained, a prey to desponding thoughts, all day in the room;
   </p>
   <p>
    but towards evening Yoletta came to take me to her mother. The summons
   </p>
   <p>
    so terrified me that for some moments I sat trembling and unable to
   </p>
   <p>
    articulate a word; for I could not but think that Chastel's end was
   </p>
   <p>
    approaching. Yoletta, however, divining the cause of my agitation,
   </p>
   <p>
    explained that her mother could not sleep for torturing pains in her
   </p>
   <p>
    head, and wished me to place my hand on her forehead, to try whether
   </p>
   <p>
    that would cause any relief. This seemed to me a not very promising
   </p>
   <p>
    remedy; but she told me that on former occasions they had often
   </p>
   <p>
    succeeded in procuring her ease by placing a hand on her forehead, and
   </p>
   <p>
    that having failed now, Chastel had desired them to call me to her to
   </p>
   <p>
    try my hand. I rose, and for the first time entered that sacred chamber,
   </p>
   <p>
    where Chastel was lying on a low bed placed on a slightly raised
   </p>
   <p>
    platform in the center of the floor. In the dim light her face looked
   </p>
   <p>
    white as the pillow on which it rested, her forehead contracted with
   </p>
   <p>
    sharp pain, while low moans came at short intervals from her twitching
   </p>
   <p>
    lips; but her wide-open eyes were fixed on my face from the moment I
   </p>
   <p>
    entered the room, and to me they seemed to express mental anguish rather
   </p>
   <p>
    than physical suffering. At the head of the bed sat the father, holding
   </p>
   <p>
    her hand in his; but when I entered he rose and made way for me,
   </p>
   <p>
    retiring to the foot of the bed, where two of the women were seated. I
   </p>
   <p>
    knelt beside the bed, and Yoletta raised and tenderly placed my right
   </p>
   <p>
    hand on the mother's forehead, and, after whispering to me to let it
   </p>
   <p>
    rest very gently there, she also withdrew a few paces.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chastel did not speak, but for some minutes continued her low, piteous
   </p>
   <p>
    moanings, only her eyes remained fixed on my face; and at last, becoming
   </p>
   <p>
    uneasy at her scrutiny, I said in a whisper: "Dearest mother, do you
   </p>
   <p>
    wish to say anything to me?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, come nearer," she replied; and when I had bent my cheek close to
   </p>
   <p>
    her face, she continued: "Do not fear, my son; I shall not die. I cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    die until that of which I have spoken to you has been accomplished."
   </p>
   <p>
    I rejoiced at her words, yet, at the same time, they gave me pain; for
   </p>
   <p>
    it seemed as though she knew how much my heart had been troubled by that
   </p>
   <p>
    ignoble fear.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Dear mother, may I say something?" I asked, wishing to tell her of my
   </p>
   <p>
    resolutions.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Not now; I know what you wish to say," she returned. "Be patient and
   </p>
   <p>
    hopeful always, and fear nothing, even though we should be long divided;
   </p>
   <p>
    for it will be many days before I can leave this room to speak with you
   </p>
   <p>
    again."
   </p>
   <p>
    So softly had she whispered, that the others who stood so near were not
   </p>
   <p>
    aware that she had spoken at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    After this brief colloquy she closed her eyes, but for some time the low
   </p>
   <p>
    moans of pain continued. Gradually they sank lower, and became less and
   </p>
   <p>
    less frequent, while the lines of pain faded out of her white,
   </p>
   <p>
    death-like face. And at length Yoletta, stealing softly to my side,
   </p>
   <p>
    whispered, "She is sleeping," and withdrawing my hand, led me away.
   </p>
   <p>
    When we were again in the Mother's Room she threw her arms about my neck
   </p>
   <p>
    and burst into a tempest of tears.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Dearest Yoletta, be comforted," I said, pressing her to my breast; "she
   </p>
   <p>
    will not die."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, Smith, how do you know?" she returned quickly, looking up with her
   </p>
   <p>
    eyes still shining with large drops.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, of Chastel's whispered words to me, I repeated those four, "I
   </p>
   <p>
    shall not die," but nothing more; they were however, a great relief to
   </p>
   <p>
    her, and her sweet, sorrowful face brightened like a drooping flower
   </p>
   <p>
    after rain.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Ah, she knew, then, that the touch of your hand would cause sleep, that
   </p>
   <p>
    sleep would save her," she said, smiling up at me.
   </p>
   <p>
    "And you, my darling, how long is it since you closed those sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    eyelids that seem so heavy?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Not since I slept three nights ago."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Will you sit by me here, resting your head on me, and sleep a little
   </p>
   <p>
    now?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Not there!" she cried quickly. "Not on the mother's couch. But if you
   </p>
   <p>
    will sit here, it will be pleasant if I can sleep for a little while,
   </p>
   <p>
    resting on you."
   </p>
   <p>
    I placed myself on the low seat she led me to, and then, when she had
   </p>
   <p>
    coiled herself up on the cushions, with her arms still round my neck,
   </p>
   <p>
    and her head resting on my bosom, she breathed a long happy sigh, and
   </p>
   <p>
    dropped like a tired child to sleep.
   </p>
   <p>
    How perfect my happiness would have been then, with Yoletta in my arms,
   </p>
   <p>
    clasping her weary little ministering hands in mine, and tenderly
   </p>
   <p>
    kissing her dark, shining hair, but for the fear that some person might
   </p>
   <p>
    come there to notice and disturb me. And pretty soon I was startled to
   </p>
   <p>
    see the father himself coming from Chastel's chamber to us. Catching
   </p>
   <p>
    sight of me he paused, smiling, then advanced, and deliberately sat down
   </p>
   <p>
    by my side.
   </p>
   <p>
    "This one is sleeping also," he said cheerfully, touching the girl's
   </p>
   <p>
    hair with his hand. "But you need not fear, Smith; I think we shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    able to talk very well without waking her."
   </p>
   <p>
    I had feared something quite different, if he had only known it, and
   </p>
   <p>
    felt considerably relieved by his words; nevertheless, I was not
   </p>
   <p>
    over-pleased at the prospect of a conversation just then, and should
   </p>
   <p>
    have preferred being left alone with my precious burden.
   </p>
   <p>
    "My son," he continued, placing a hand on my shoulder, "I sometimes
   </p>
   <p>
    recall, not without a smile, the effect your first appearance produced
   </p>
   <p>
    on us, when we were startled at your somewhat grotesque pilgrim costume.
   </p>
   <p>
    Your attempts at singing, and ignorance of art generally, also impressed
   </p>
   <p>
    me unfavorably, and gave me some concern when I thought about the
   </p>
   <p>
    future--that is, your future; for it seemed to me that you had
   </p>
   <p>
    but slender foundations whereon to build a happy life. These doubts,
   </p>
   <p>
    however, no longer trouble me; for on several occasions you have shown
   </p>
   <p>
    us that you possess abundantly that richest of all gifts and safest
   </p>
   <p>
    guide to happiness--the capacity for deep affection. To this spirit of
   </p>
   <p>
    love in you--this summer of the heart which causes it to blossom with
   </p>
   <p>
    beautiful thoughts and deeds--I attribute your success just now, when
   </p>
   <p>
    the contact of your hand produced the long-desired, refreshing slumber
   </p>
   <p>
    so necessary to the mother at this stage of her malady. I know that this
   </p>
   <p>
    is a mysterious thing; and it is commonly said that in such cases relief
   </p>
   <p>
    is caused by an emanation from the brain through the fingers. Doubtless
   </p>
   <p>
    this is so; and I also choose to believe that only a powerful spirit of
   </p>
   <p>
    love in the heart can rightly direct this subtle energy, that where such
   </p>
   <p>
    a spirit is absent the desired effect cannot be produced."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I do not know," I replied. "Great as my love and devotion is, I cannot
   </p>
   <p>
    suppose it to equal, much less to surpass, that of others who yet failed
   </p>
   <p>
    on this occasion to give relief."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, yes; only that is looking merely at the surface of the matter, and
   </p>
   <p>
    leaving out of sight the unfathomable mysteries of a being compounded of
   </p>
   <p>
    flesh and spirit. There are among our best instruments peculiar to this
   </p>
   <p>
    house, especially those used chiefly in our harvest music, some of such
   </p>
   <p>
    finely-tempered materials, and of so delicate a construction, that the
   </p>
   <p>
    person wishing to perform on them must not only be inspired with the
   </p>
   <p>
    melodious passion, but the entire system--body and soul--must be in the
   </p>
   <p>
    proper mood, the flesh itself elevated into harmony with the exalted
   </p>
   <p>
    spirit, else he will fail to elicit the tones or to give the expression
   </p>
   <p>
    desired. This is a rough and a poor simile, when we consider how
   </p>
   <p>
    wonderful an instrument a human being is, with the body that burns with
   </p>
   <p>
    thought, and the spirit that quivers and cries with pain, and when we
   </p>
   <p>
    think how its innumerable, complex chords may be injured and untuned by
   </p>
   <p>
    suffering. The will may be ours, but something, we know not what,
   </p>
   <p>
    interposes to defeat our best efforts. That you have succeeded in
   </p>
   <p>
    producing so blessed a result, after we had failed, has served to deepen
   </p>
   <p>
    and widen in our hearts the love we already felt for you; for how much
   </p>
   <p>
    more precious is this melody of repose, this sweet interval of relief
   </p>
   <p>
    from cruel pain the mother now experiences, than many melodies from
   </p>
   <p>
    clear voices and trained hands."
   </p>
   <p>
    In my secret heart I believed that he was taking much too lofty a view
   </p>
   <p>
    of the matter; but I had no desire to argue against so flattering a
   </p>
   <p>
    delusion, if it were one, and only wished that I could share it with
   </p>
   <p>
    him.
   </p>
   <p>
    "She is sleeping still," he said presently, "perhaps without pain, like
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta here, and her sleep will now probably last for some hours."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I pray Heaven that she may wake refreshed and free from pain," I
   </p>
   <p>
    remarked.
   </p>
   <p>
    He seemed surprised at my words, and looked searchingly into my face.
   </p>
   <p>
    "My son," he said, "it grieves me, at a moment like the present, to have
   </p>
   <p>
    to point out a great error to you; but it is an error hurtful to
   </p>
   <p>
    yourself and painful to those who see it, and if I were to pass it over
   </p>
   <p>
    in silence, or put off speaking of it to another time, I should not be
   </p>
   <p>
    fulfilling the part of a loving father towards you."
   </p>
   <p>
    Surprised at this speech, I begged him to tell me what I had said that
   </p>
   <p>
    was wrong.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Do you not then know that it is unlawful to entertain such a thought as
   </p>
   <p>
    you have expressed?" he said. "In moments of supreme pain or bitterness
   </p>
   <p>
    or peril we sometimes so far forget ourselves as to cry out to Heaven to
   </p>
   <p>
    save us or to give us ease; but to make any such petition when we are in
   </p>
   <p>
    the full possession of our faculties is unworthy of a reasonable being,
   </p>
   <p>
    and an offense to the Father: for we pray to each other, and are moved
   </p>
   <p>
    by such prayers, remembering that we are fallible, and often err through
   </p>
   <p>
    haste and forgetfulness and imperfect knowledge. But he who freely gave
   </p>
   <p>
    us life and reason and all good gifts, needs not that we should remind
   </p>
   <p>
    him of anything; therefore to ask him to give us the thing we desire is
   </p>
   <p>
    to make him like ourselves, and charge him with an oversight; or worse,
   </p>
   <p>
    we attribute weakness and irresolution to him, since the petitioner
   </p>
   <p>
    thinks my importunity to incline the balance in his favor."
   </p>
   <p>
    I was about to reply that I had always considered prayer to be an
   </p>
   <p>
    essential part of religion, and not of my form of religion only, but of
   </p>
   <p>
    all religions all over the world. Luckily I remembered in time that he
   </p>
   <p>
    probably knew more about matters "all over the world" than I did, and so
   </p>
   <p>
    held my tongue.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Have you any doubts on the subject?" he asked, after a while.
   </p>
   <p>
    "I must confess that I still have some doubts," I replied. "I believe
   </p>
   <p>
    that our Creator and Father desires the happiness of all his creatures
   </p>
   <p>
    and takes no pleasure in seeing us miserable; for it would be impossible
   </p>
   <p>
    not to believe it, seeing how greatly happiness overbalances misery in
   </p>
   <p>
    the world. But he does not come to us in visible form to tell us in an
   </p>
   <p>
    audible voice that to cry out to him in sore pain and distress is
   </p>
   <p>
    unlawful. How, then, do we know this thing? For a child cries to its
   </p>
   <p>
    mother, and a fledgling in the nest to its parent bird; and he is
   </p>
   <p>
    infinitely more to us than parent to child--infinitely stronger to help,
   </p>
   <p>
    and knows our griefs as no fellow-mortal can know them. May we not,
   </p>
   <p>
    then, believe, without hurt to our souls, that the cry of one of his
   </p>
   <p>
    children in affliction may reach him; that in his compassion, and by
   </p>
   <p>
    means of his sovereign power over nature, he may give ease to the racked
   </p>
   <p>
    body, and peace and joy to the desolate mind?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "You ask me, How, then, do we know this thing? and you answer the
   </p>
   <p>
    question yourself, yet fail to perceive that you answer it, when you say
   </p>
   <p>
    that although he does not come in a visible form to teach us this thing
   </p>
   <p>
    and that thing, yet we know that he desires our happiness; and to this
   </p>
   <p>
    you might have added a thousand or ten thousand other things which we
   </p>
   <p>
    know. If the reason he gave us to start with makes it unnecessary that
   </p>
   <p>
    he should come to tell us in an audible voice that he desires our
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness, it must also surely suffice to tell us which are lawful and
   </p>
   <p>
    which unlawful of all the thoughts continually rising in our hearts.
   </p>
   <p>
    That any one should question so evident and universally accepted a
   </p>
   <p>
    truth, the foundation of all religion, seems very surprising to me. If
   </p>
   <p>
    it had consisted with his plan to make these delicate mortal bodies
   </p>
   <p>
    capable of every agreeable sensation in the highest degree, yet not
   </p>
   <p>
    liable to accident, and not subject to misery and pain, he would surely
   </p>
   <p>
    have done this for all of us. But reason and nature show us that such an
   </p>
   <p>
    end did not consist with his plan; therefore to ask him to suspend the
   </p>
   <p>
    operations of nature for the benefit of any individual sufferer, however
   </p>
   <p>
    poignant and unmerited the sufferings may be, is to shut our eyes to the
   </p>
   <p>
    only light he has given us. All our highest and sweetest feelings unite
   </p>
   <p>
    with reason to tell us with one voice that he loves us; and our
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge of nature shows us plainly enough that he also loves all the
   </p>
   <p>
    creatures inferior to man. To us he has given reason for a guide, and
   </p>
   <p>
    for the guidance and protection of the lower kinds he has given
   </p>
   <p>
    instinct: and though they do not know him, it would make us doubt his
   </p>
   <p>
    impartial love for all his creatures, if we, by making use of our
   </p>
   <p>
    reason, higher knowledge, and articulate speech, were able to call down
   </p>
   <p>
    benefits on ourselves, and avert pain and disaster, while the dumb,
   </p>
   <p>
    irrational brutes suffered in silence--the languishing deer that leaves
   </p>
   <p>
    the herd with a festering thorn in its foot; the passage bird blown from
   </p>
   <p>
    its course to perish miserably far out at sea."
   </p>
   <p>
    His conclusions were perhaps more logical than mine; nevertheless,
   </p>
   <p>
    although I could not argue the matter any more with him, I was not yet
   </p>
   <p>
    prepared to abandon this last cherished shred of old beliefs, although
   </p>
   <p>
    perhaps not cherished for its intrinsic worth, but rather because it had
   </p>
   <p>
    been given to me by a sweet woman whose memory was sacred to my
   </p>
   <p>
    heart--my mother before Chastel.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fortunately, it was not necessary to continue the discussion any longer,
   </p>
   <p>
    for at this juncture one of the watchers from the sick-room came to
   </p>
   <p>
    report that the mother was still sleeping peacefully, hearing which, the
   </p>
   <p>
    father rose to seek a little needful rest in an adjoining room. Before
   </p>
   <p>
    going, however, he proposed, with mistaken kindness, to relieve me of my
   </p>
   <p>
    burden, and place the girl without waking her on a couch. But I would
   </p>
   <p>
    not consent to have her disturbed; and finally, to my great delight,
   </p>
   <p>
    they left her still in my arms, the father warmly pressing my hand, and
   </p>
   <p>
    advising me to reflect well on his words concerning prayer.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was growing dark now, and how welcome that obscurity seemed, while
   </p>
   <p>
    with no one nigh to see or hear I kissed her soft tresses a hundred
   </p>
   <p>
    times, and murmured a hundred endearing words in her sleeping ears.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her waking, which gave me a pang at first, afforded me in the end a
   </p>
   <p>
    still greater bliss.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, how dark it is--where am I?" she exclaimed, starting suddenly from
   </p>
   <p>
    repose.
   </p>
   <p>
    "With me, sweetest," I said. "Do you not remember going to sleep on my
   </p>
   <p>
    breast?"
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes; but oh, why did you not wake me sooner? My mother--my mother--"
   </p>
   <p>
    "She is still quietly sleeping, dearest. Ah, I wish you also had
   </p>
   <p>
    continued sleeping! It was such a delight to have you in my arms."
   </p>
   <p>
    "My love!" she said, laying her soft cheek against mine. "How sweet it
   </p>
   <p>
    was to fall asleep in your arms! When we came in here I could scarcely
   </p>
   <p>
    say a word, for my heart was too full for speech; and now I have a
   </p>
   <p>
    hundred things to say. After all, I should only finish by giving you a
   </p>
   <p>
    kiss, which is more eloquent than speech; so I shall kiss you at once,
   </p>
   <p>
    and save myself the trouble of talking so much."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Say one of the hundred things, Yoletta."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, Smith, before this evening I did not think that I could love you
   </p>
   <p>
    more; and sometimes, when I recalled what I once said to you--on the
   </p>
   <p>
    hill, do you remember?--it seemed to me that I already loved you a
   </p>
   <p>
    little too much. But now I am convinced that I was mistaken, for a
   </p>
   <p>
    thousand offenses could not alienate my heart, which is all yours
   </p>
   <p>
    forever."
   </p>
   <p>
    "Mine for ever, without a doubt, darling?" I murmured, holding her
   </p>
   <p>
    against my breast; and in my rapture almost forgetting that this angelic
   </p>
   <p>
    affection she lavished on me would not long satisfy my heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Yes, for ever, for you shall never, never leave the house. Your
   </p>
   <p>
    pilgrimage, from which you derived so little benefit, is over now. And
   </p>
   <p>
    if you ever attempt to go forth again to find out new wonders in the
   </p>
   <p>
    world, I shall clasp you round with my arms, as I do now, and keep you
   </p>
   <p>
    prisoner against your will; and if you say 'Farewell' a hundred times to
   </p>
   <p>
    me, I shall blot out that sad word every time with my lips, and put a
   </p>
   <p>
    better one in its place, until my word conquers yours."
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 19
   </p>
   <p>
    Although deprived for the present of all intercourse with Chastel and
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta, now in constant attendance on her mother, I ought to have been
   </p>
   <p>
    happy, for all things seemed conspiring to make my life precious to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nevertheless, I was far from happy; and, having heard so much said about
   </p>
   <p>
    reason in my late conversations with the father and mother of the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    I began to pay an unusual amount of attention to this faculty in me, in
   </p>
   <p>
    order to discover by its aid the secret of the sadness which continued
   </p>
   <p>
    at all times during this period to oppress my heart. I only discovered,
   </p>
   <p>
    what others have discovered before me, that the practice of
   </p>
   <p>
    introspection has a corrosive effect on the mind, which only serves to
   </p>
   <p>
    aggravate the malady it is intended to cure. During those restful days
   </p>
   <p>
    in the Mother's Room, when I had sat with Chastel, this spirit of
   </p>
   <p>
    melancholy had been with me; but the mother's hallowing presence had
   </p>
   <p>
    given something of a divine color to it, my passions had slumbered, and,
   </p>
   <p>
    except at rare intervals, I had thought of sorrow as of something at an
   </p>
   <p>
    immeasurable distance from me. Then to my spirit
   </p>
   <p>
    "The gushing of the wave
   </p>
   <p>
    Far, far away, did seem to mourn and rave
   </p>
   <p>
    On alien shores";
   </p>
   <p>
    and so sweet had seemed that pause, that I had hoped and prayed for its
   </p>
   <p>
    continuance. No sooner was I separated from her than the charm
   </p>
   <p>
    dissolved, and all my thoughts, like evening clouds that appear luminous
   </p>
   <p>
    and rich in color until the sun has set, began to be darkened with a
   </p>
   <p>
    mysterious gloom. Strive how I might, I was unable to compose my mind to
   </p>
   <p>
    that serene, trustful temper she had desired to see in me, and without
   </p>
   <p>
    which there could be no blissful futurity. After all the admonitions and
   </p>
   <p>
    the comforting assurances I had received, and in spite of reason and all
   </p>
   <p>
    it could say to me, each night I went to my bed with a heavy heart; and
   </p>
   <p>
    each morning when I woke, there, by my pillow, waited that sad phantom,
   </p>
   <p>
    to go with me where I went, to remind me at every pause of an implacable
   </p>
   <p>
    Fate, who held my future in its hands, who was mightier than Chastel,
   </p>
   <p>
    and would shatter all her schemes for my happiness like vessels of
   </p>
   <p>
    brittle glass.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several days--probably about fifteen, for I did not count them--had
   </p>
   <p>
    passed since I had been admitted into the mother's sleeping-room, when
   </p>
   <p>
    there came an exceedingly lovely day, which seemed to bring to me a
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant sensation of returning health, and made me long to escape from
   </p>
   <p>
    morbid dreams and vain cravings. Why should I sit at home and mope, I
   </p>
   <p>
    thought; it was better to be active: sun and wind were full of healing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such a day was in truth one of those captain jewels "that seldom placed
   </p>
   <p>
    are" among the blusterous days of late autumn, with winter already
   </p>
   <p>
    present to speed its parting. For a long time the sky had been overcast
   </p>
   <p>
    with multitudes and endless hurrying processions of wild-looking
   </p>
   <p>
    clouds--torn, wind-chased fugitives, of every mournful shade of color,
   </p>
   <p>
    from palest gray to slatey-black; and storms of rain had been frequent,
   </p>
   <p>
    impetuous, and suddenly intermitted, or passing away phantom-like
   </p>
   <p>
    towards the misty hills, there to lose themselves among other phantoms,
   </p>
   <p>
    ever wandering sorrowfully in that vast, shadowy borderland where earth
   </p>
   <p>
    and heaven mingled; and gusts of wind which, as they roared by over a
   </p>
   <p>
    thousand straining trees and passed off with hoarse, volleying sounds,
   </p>
   <p>
    seemed to mimic the echoing thunder. And the leaves--the millions and
   </p>
   <p>
    myriads of sere, cast-off leaves, heaped ankle-deep under the desolate
   </p>
   <p>
    giants of the wood, and everywhere, in the hollows of the earth, lying
   </p>
   <p>
    silent and motionless, as became dead, fallen things--suddenly catching a
   </p>
   <p>
    mock fantastic life from the wind, how they would all be up and
   </p>
   <p>
    stirring, every leaf with a hiss like a viper, racing, many thousands at
   </p>
   <p>
    a time, over the barren spaces, all hurriedly talking together in their
   </p>
   <p>
    dead-leaf language! until, smitten with a mightier gust, they would rise
   </p>
   <p>
    in flight on flight, in storms and stupendous, eddying columns, whirled
   </p>
   <p>
    up to the clouds, to fall to the earth again in showers, and freckle the
   </p>
   <p>
    grass for roods around. Then for a moment, far off in heavens, there
   </p>
   <p>
    would be a rift, or a thinning of the clouds, and the sunbeams, striking
   </p>
   <p>
    like lightning through their ranks, would illumine the pale blue mist,
   </p>
   <p>
    the slanting rain, the gaunt black boles and branches, glittering with
   </p>
   <p>
    wet, casting a momentary glory over the ocean-like tumult of nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the condition I was in, with a relaxed body and dejected mind, this
   </p>
   <p>
    tempestuous period, which would have only afforded fresh delight to a
   </p>
   <p>
    person in perfect health, had no charm for my spirit; but, on the
   </p>
   <p>
    contrary, it only served to intensify my gloom. And yet day after day it
   </p>
   <p>
    drew me forth, although in my weakness I shivered in the rough gale, and
   </p>
   <p>
    shrank from the touch of the big cold drops the clouds flung down on me.
   </p>
   <p>
    It fascinated me, like the sight of armies contending in battle, or of
   </p>
   <p>
    some tragic action from which the spectator cannot withdraw his gaze.
   </p>
   <p>
    For I had become infected with strange fancies, so persistent and somber
   </p>
   <p>
    that they were like superstitions. It seemed to me that not I but nature
   </p>
   <p>
    had changed, that the familiar light had passed like a kindly expression
   </p>
   <p>
    from her countenance, which was now charged with an awful menacing gloom
   </p>
   <p>
    that frightened my soul. Sometimes, when straying alone, like an unquiet
   </p>
   <p>
    ghost among the leafless trees, when a deeper shadow swept over the
   </p>
   <p>
    earth, I would pause, pale with apprehension, listening to the many
   </p>
   <p>
    dirge-like sounds of the forest, ever prophesying evil, until in my
   </p>
   <p>
    trepidation I would start and tremble, and look to this side and to
   </p>
   <p>
    that, as if considering which way to fly from some unimaginable calamity
   </p>
   <p>
    coming, I knew not from where, to wreck my life for ever.
   </p>
   <p>
    This bright day was better suited to my complaint. The sun shone as in
   </p>
   <p>
    spring; not a stain appeared on the crystal vault of heaven; everywhere
   </p>
   <p>
    the unfailing grass gave rest to the eye with its verdure; and a light
   </p>
   <p>
    wind blew fresh and bracing in my face, making my pulses beat faster,
   </p>
   <p>
    although feebly still. Remembering my happy wood-cutting days, before my
   </p>
   <p>
    trouble had come to me, I got my ax and started to walk to the wood;
   </p>
   <p>
    then seeing Yoletta watching my departure from the terrace, I waved my
   </p>
   <p>
    hand to her. Before I had gone far, however, she came running to me,
   </p>
   <p>
    full of anxiety, to warn me that I was not yet strong enough for such
   </p>
   <p>
    work. I assured her that I had no intention of working hard and tiring
   </p>
   <p>
    myself, then continued my walk, while she returned to attend on her
   </p>
   <p>
    mother.
   </p>
   <p>
    The day was so bright with sunshine that it inspired me with a kind of
   </p>
   <p>
    passing gladness, and I began to hum snatches of old half-remembered
   </p>
   <p>
    songs. They were songs of departing summer, tinged with melancholy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    suggested other verses not meant for singing, which I began repeating.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Rich flowers have perished on the silent earth--
   </p>
   <p>
    Blossoms of valley and of wood that gave
   </p>
   <p>
    A fragrance to the winds."
   </p>
   <p>
    And again:
   </p>
   <p>
    "The blithesome birds have sought a sunnier shore;
   </p>
   <p>
    They lingered till the cold cold winds went in
   </p>
   <p>
    And withered their green homes."
   </p>
   <p>
    And these also were fragments, breathing only of sadness, which made me
   </p>
   <p>
    resolve to dismiss poetry from my mind and think of nothing at all. I
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to interest myself in a flight of buzzard-like hawks, soaring in
   </p>
   <p>
    wide circles at an immense height above me. Gazing up into that far blue
   </p>
   <p>
    vault, under which they moved so serenely, and which seemed so infinite,
   </p>
   <p>
    I remembered how often in former days, when gazing up into such a sky, I
   </p>
   <p>
    had breathed a prayer to the Unseen Spirit; but now I recalled the words
   </p>
   <p>
    the father of the house had spoken to me, and the prayer died unformed
   </p>
   <p>
    in my heart, and a strange feeling of orphanhood saddened me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    brought my eyes to earth again.
   </p>
   <p>
    Half-way to the wood, on an open reach where there were no trees or
   </p>
   <p>
    bushes, I came on a great company of storks, half a thousand of them at
   </p>
   <p>
    least, apparently resting on their travels, for they were all standing
   </p>
   <p>
    motionless, with necks drawn in, as if dozing. They were very stately,
   </p>
   <p>
    handsome birds, clear gray in color, with a black collar on the neck,
   </p>
   <p>
    and red beak and legs. My approach did not disturb them until I was
   </p>
   <p>
    within twenty yards of the nearest--for they were scattered over an acre
   </p>
   <p>
    of ground; then they rose with a loud, rustling noise of wings, only to
   </p>
   <p>
    settle again at a short distance off.
   </p>
   <p>
    Incredible numbers of birds, chiefly waterfowl, had appeared in the
   </p>
   <p>
    neighborhood since the beginning of the wet, boisterous weather; the
   </p>
   <p>
    river too was filled with these new visitors, and I was told that most
   </p>
   <p>
    of them were passengers driven from distant northern regions, which they
   </p>
   <p>
    made their summer home, and were now flying south in search of a warmer
   </p>
   <p>
    climate.
   </p>
   <p>
    All this movement in the feathered world had, during my troubled days,
   </p>
   <p>
    brought me as little pleasure as the other changes going on about me:
   </p>
   <p>
    those winged armies ever hurrying by in broken detachments, wailing and
   </p>
   <p>
    clanging by day and by night in the clouds, white with their own terror,
   </p>
   <p>
    or black-plumed like messengers of doom, to my distempered fancy only
   </p>
   <p>
    added a fresh element of fear to a nature racked with disorders, and
   </p>
   <p>
    full of tremendous signs and omens.
   </p>
   <p>
    The interest with which I now remarked these pilgrim storks seemed to me
   </p>
   <p>
    a pleasant symptom of a return to a saner state of mind, and before
   </p>
   <p>
    continuing my walk I wished that Yoletta had been there with me to see
   </p>
   <p>
    them and tell me their history; for she was curious about such matters,
   </p>
   <p>
    and had a most wonderful affection for the whole feathered race. She had
   </p>
   <p>
    her favorites among the birds at different seasons, and the kind she
   </p>
   <p>
    most esteemed now had been arriving for over a month, their numbers
   </p>
   <p>
    increasing day by day until the woods and fields were alive with their
   </p>
   <p>
    flocks.
   </p>
   <p>
    This kind was named the cloud-bird, on account of its starling-like
   </p>
   <p>
    habit of wheeling about over its feeding-ground, the birds throwing
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves into masses, then scattering and gathering again many times,
   </p>
   <p>
    so that when viewed at a distance a large flock had the appearance of a
   </p>
   <p>
    cloud, growing dark and thin alternately, and continually changing its
   </p>
   <p>
    form. It was somewhat larger than a starling, with a freer flight, and
   </p>
   <p>
    had a richer plumage, its color being deep glossy blue, or blue-black,
   </p>
   <p>
    and underneath bright chestnut. When close at hand and in the bright
   </p>
   <p>
    sunshine, the aerial gambols of a flock were beautiful to witness, as
   </p>
   <p>
    the birds wheeled about and displayed in turn, as if moved by one
   </p>
   <p>
    impulse, first the rich blue, then the bright chestnut surfaces to the
   </p>
   <p>
    eye. The charming effect was increased by the bell-like, chirping notes
   </p>
   <p>
    they all uttered together, and as they swept round or doubled in the air
   </p>
   <p>
    at intervals came these tempests of melodious sound--a most perfect
   </p>
   <p>
    expression of wild jubilant bird-life. Yoletta, discoursing in the most
   </p>
   <p>
    delightful way about her loved cloud-birds, had told me that they spent
   </p>
   <p>
    the summer season in great solitary marshes, where they built their
   </p>
   <p>
    nests in the rushes; but with cold weather they flew abroad, and at such
   </p>
   <p>
    times seemed always to prefer the neighborhood of man, remaining in
   </p>
   <p>
    great flocks near the house until the next spring. On this bright sunny
   </p>
   <p>
    morning I was amazed at the multitudes I saw during my walk: yet it was
   </p>
   <p>
    not strange that birds were so abundant, considering that there were no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer any savages on the earth, with nothing to amuse their vacant
   </p>
   <p>
    minds except killing the feathered creatures with their bows and arrows,
   </p>
   <p>
    and no innumerable company of squaws clamorous for trophies--unchristian
   </p>
   <p>
    women of the woods with painted faces, insolence in their eyes, and for
   </p>
   <p>
    ornaments the feathered skins torn from slain birds on their heads.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I at length arrived at the wood, I went to that spot where I had
   </p>
   <p>
    felled the large tree on the occasion of my last and disastrous visit,
   </p>
   <p>
    and where Yoletta, newly released from confinement, had found me. There
   </p>
   <p>
    lay the rough-barked giant exactly as I had left it, and once more I
   </p>
   <p>
    began to hack at the large branches; but my feeble strokes seemed to
   </p>
   <p>
    make little impression, and becoming tired in a very short time, I
   </p>
   <p>
    concluded that I was not yet equal to such work, and sat myself down to
   </p>
   <p>
    rest. I remembered how, when sitting on that very spot, I had heard a
   </p>
   <p>
    slight rustling of the withered leaves, and looking up beheld Yoletta
   </p>
   <p>
    coming swiftly towards me with outstretched arms, and her face shining
   </p>
   <p>
    with joy. Perhaps she would come again to me to-day: yes, she would
   </p>
   <p>
    surely come when I wished for her so much; for she had followed me out
   </p>
   <p>
    to try to dissuade me from going to the woods, and would be anxiously
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking about me; and she could spare an hour from the sick-room now.
   </p>
   <p>
    The trees and bushes would prevent me from seeing her approach, but I
   </p>
   <p>
    should hear her, as I had heard her before. I sat motionless, scarcely
   </p>
   <p>
    breathing, straining my sense to catch the first faint sound of her
   </p>
   <p>
    light, swift step; and every time a small bird, hopping along the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground, rustled a withered leaf, I started up to greet and embrace her.
   </p>
   <p>
    But she did not come; and at last, sick at heart with hope deferred, I
   </p>
   <p>
    covered my face with my hands, and, weak with misery, cried like a
   </p>
   <p>
    disappointed child.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently something touched me, and, removing my hands from my face, I
   </p>
   <p>
    saw that great silver-gray dog which had come to Yoletta's call when I
   </p>
   <p>
    fainted, sitting before me with his chin resting on my knees. No doubt
   </p>
   <p>
    he remembered that last wood-cutting day very well, and had come to take
   </p>
   <p>
    care of me now.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Welcome, dear old friend!" said I; and in my craving for sympathy of
   </p>
   <p>
    some kind I put my arms over him, and pressed my face against his. Then
   </p>
   <p>
    I sat up again, and gazed into the pair of clear brown eyes watching my
   </p>
   <p>
    face so gravely.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Look here, old fellow," said I, talking audibly to him for want of
   </p>
   <p>
    something in human shape to address, "you didn't lick my face just now
   </p>
   <p>
    when you might have done so with impunity; and when I speak to you, you
   </p>
   <p>
    don't wag that beautiful bushy tail which serves you for ornament. This
   </p>
   <p>
    reminds me that you are not like the dogs I used to know--the dogs that
   </p>
   <p>
    talked with their tails, caressed with their tongues, and were never
   </p>
   <p>
    over-clean or well-behaved. Where are they now--collies, rat-worrying
   </p>
   <p>
    terriers, hounds, spaniels, pointers, retrievers--dogs rough and dogs
   </p>
   <p>
    smooth; big brute boarhounds, St. Bernard's, mastiffs, nearly or quite
   </p>
   <p>
    as big as you are, but not so slender, silky-haired, and sharp-nosed,
   </p>
   <p>
    and without your refined expression of keenness without cunning. And
   </p>
   <p>
    after these canine noblemen of the old regime, whither has
   </p>
   <p>
    vanished the countless rabble of mongrels, curs, and pariah dogs; and
   </p>
   <p>
    last of all--being more degenerate--the corpulent, blear-eyed, wheezy
   </p>
   <p>
    pet dogs of a hundred breeds? They are all dead, no doubt: they have
   </p>
   <p>
    been dead so long that I daresay nature extracted all the valuable salts
   </p>
   <p>
    that were contained in their flesh and bones thousands of years ago, and
   </p>
   <p>
    used it for better things--raindrops, froth of the sea, flowers and
   </p>
   <p>
    fruit, and blades of grass. Yet there was not a beast in all that crew
   </p>
   <p>
    of which its master or mistress was not ready to affirm that it could do
   </p>
   <p>
    everything but talk! No one says that of you, my gentle guardian; for
   </p>
   <p>
    dog-worship, with all the ten thousand fungoid cults that sprang up and
   </p>
   <p>
    flourished exceedingly in the muddy marsh of man's intellect, has
   </p>
   <p>
    withered quite away, and left no seed. Yet in intelligence you are, I
   </p>
   <p>
    fancy, somewhat ahead of your far-off progenitors: long use has also
   </p>
   <p>
    given you something like a conscience. You are a good, sensible beast,
   </p>
   <p>
    that's all. You love and serve your master, according to your lights;
   </p>
   <p>
    night and day, you, with your fellows, guard his flocks and herds, his
   </p>
   <p>
    house and fields. Into his sacred house, however, you do not intrude
   </p>
   <p>
    your comely countenance, knowing your place."
   </p>
   <p>
    "What, then, happened to earth, and how long did that undreaming slumber
   </p>
   <p>
    last from which I woke to find things so altered? I do not know, nor
   </p>
   <p>
    does it matter very much. I only know that there has been a sort of
   </p>
   <p>
    mighty Savonarola bonfire, in which most of the things once valued have
   </p>
   <p>
    been consumed to ashes--politics, religions, systems of philosophy, isms
   </p>
   <p>
    and ologies of all descriptions; schools, churches, prisons, poorhouses;
   </p>
   <p>
    stimulants and tobacco; kings and parliaments; cannon with its hostile
   </p>
   <p>
    roar, and pianos that thundered peacefully; history, the press, vice,
   </p>
   <p>
    political economy, money, and a million things more--all consumed like
   </p>
   <p>
    so much worthless hay and stubble. This being so, why am I not
   </p>
   <p>
    overwhelmed at the thought of it? In that feverish, full age--so full,
   </p>
   <p>
    and yet, my God, how empty!--in the wilderness of every man's soul, was
   </p>
   <p>
    not a voice heard crying out, prophesying the end? I know that a thought
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes came to me, passing through my brain like lightning through
   </p>
   <p>
    the foliage of a tree; and in the quick, blighting fire of that
   </p>
   <p>
    intolerable thought, all hopes, beliefs, dreams, and schemes seemed
   </p>
   <p>
    instantaneously to shrivel up and turn to ashes, and drop from me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    leave me naked and desolate. Sometimes it came when I read a book of
   </p>
   <p>
    philosophy; or listened on a still, hot Sunday to a dull preacher--they
   </p>
   <p>
    were mostly dull--prosing away to a sleepy, fashionable congregation
   </p>
   <p>
    about Daniel in the lions' den, or some other equally remote matter; or
   </p>
   <p>
    when I walked in crowded thoroughfares; or when I heard some great
   </p>
   <p>
    politician out of office--out in the cold, like a miserable working-man
   </p>
   <p>
    with no work to do--hurling anathemas at an iniquitous government; and
   </p>
   <p>
    sometimes also when I lay awake in the silent watches of the night. A
   </p>
   <p>
    little while, the thought said, and all this will be no more; for we
   </p>
   <p>
    have not found out the secret of happiness, and all our toil and effort
   </p>
   <p>
    is misdirected; and those who are seeking for a mechanical equivalent of
   </p>
   <p>
    consciousness, and those who are going about doing good, are alike
   </p>
   <p>
    wasting their lives; and on all our hopes, beliefs, dreams, theories,
   </p>
   <p>
    and enthusiasms, 'Passing away' is written plainly as the Mene, mene,
   </p>
   <p>
    tekel, upharsin seen by Belshazzar on the wall of his palace in
   </p>
   <p>
    Babylon."
   </p>
   <p>
    "That withering thought never comes to me now. 'Passing away' is not
   </p>
   <p>
    written on the earth, which is still God's green footstool; the grass
   </p>
   <p>
    was not greener nor the flowers sweeter when man was first made out of
   </p>
   <p>
    clay, and the breath of life breathed into his nostrils. And the human
   </p>
   <p>
    family and race--outcome of all that dead, unimaginable past--this also
   </p>
   <p>
    appears to have the stamp of everlastingness on it; and in its tranquil
   </p>
   <p>
    power and majesty resembles some vast mountain that lifts its head above
   </p>
   <p>
    the clouds, and has its granite roots deep down in the world's center. A
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling of awe is in me when I gaze on it; but it is vain to ask myself
   </p>
   <p>
    now whether the vanished past, with its manifold troubles and transitory
   </p>
   <p>
    delights, was preferable to this unchanging peaceful present. I care for
   </p>
   <p>
    nothing but Yoletta; and if the old world was consumed to ashes that she
   </p>
   <p>
    might be created, I am pleased that it was so consumed; for nobler than
   </p>
   <p>
    all perished hopes and ambitions is the hope that I may one day wear
   </p>
   <p>
    that bright, consummate flower on my bosom."
   </p>
   <p>
    "I have only one trouble now--a wolf that follows me everywhere, always
   </p>
   <p>
    threatening to rend me to pieces with its black jaws. Not you, old
   </p>
   <p>
    friend--a great, gaunt, man-eating, metaphorical wolf, far more terrible
   </p>
   <p>
    than that beast of the ancients which came to the poor man's door. In
   </p>
   <p>
    the darkness its eyes, glowing like coals, are ever watching me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    even in the bright daylight its shadowy form is ever near me, stealing
   </p>
   <p>
    from bush to bush, or from room to room, always dogging my footsteps.
   </p>
   <p>
    Will it ever vanish, like a mere phantom--a wolf of the brain--or will
   </p>
   <p>
    it come nearer and more near, to spring upon and rend me at the last? If
   </p>
   <p>
    they could only clothe my mind as they have my body, to make me like
   </p>
   <p>
    themselves with no canker at my heart, ever contented and calmly glad!
   </p>
   <p>
    But nothing comes from taking thought. I am sick of thought--I hate it!
   </p>
   <p>
    Away with it! I shall go and look for Yoletta, since she does not come
   </p>
   <p>
    to me. Good-by, old friend, you have been well-behaved and listened with
   </p>
   <p>
    considerable patience to a long discourse. It will benefit you about as
   </p>
   <p>
    much as I have been benefited by many a lecture and many a sermon I was
   </p>
   <p>
    compelled to listen to in the old vanished days."
   </p>
   <p>
    Bestowing another caress on him I got up and went back to the house,
   </p>
   <p>
    thinking sadly as I walked that the bright weather had not yet greatly
   </p>
   <p>
    improved my spirits.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chapter 20
   </p>
   <p>
    Arrived at the house I was again disappointed at not seeing Yoletta; yet
   </p>
   <p>
    without reasonable cause, since it was scarcely past midday, and she
   </p>
   <p>
    came out from attending on her mother only at long intervals--in the
   </p>
   <p>
    morning, and again just before evening--to taste the freshness of nature
   </p>
   <p>
    for a few minutes.
   </p>
   <p>
    The music-room was deserted when I went there; but it was made warm and
   </p>
   <p>
    pleasant by the sun shining brightly in at the doors opening to the
   </p>
   <p>
    south. I went on to the extreme end of the room, remembering now that I
   </p>
   <p>
    had seen some volumes there when I had no time or inclination to look at
   </p>
   <p>
    them, and I wanted something to read; for although I found reading very
   </p>
   <p>
    irksome at this period, there was really little else I could do. I found
   </p>
   <p>
    the books--three volumes--in the lower part of an alcove in the wall;
   </p>
   <p>
    above them, within a niche in the alcove, on a level with my face as I
   </p>
   <p>
    stood there, I observed a bulb-shaped bottle, with a long thin neck,
   </p>
   <p>
    very beautifully colored. I had seen it before, but without paying
   </p>
   <p>
    particular attention to it, there being so many treasures of its kind in
   </p>
   <p>
    the house; now, seeing it so closely, I could not help admiring its
   </p>
   <p>
    exquisite beauty, and feeling puzzled at the scene depicted on it. In
   </p>
   <p>
    the widest part it was encircled with a band, and on it appeared slim
   </p>
   <p>
    youths and maidens, in delicate, rose-colored garments, with butterfly
   </p>
   <p>
    wings on their shoulders, running or hurriedly walking, playing on
   </p>
   <p>
    instruments of various forms, their faces shining with gladness, their
   </p>
   <p>
    golden hair tossed by the wind--a gay procession, without beginning or
   </p>
   <p>
    end. Behind these joyful ones, in pale gray, and half-obscured by the
   </p>
   <p>
    mists that formed the background, appeared a second procession, hurrying
   </p>
   <p>
    in an opposite direction--men and women of all ages, but mostly old,
   </p>
   <p>
    with haggard, woebegone faces; some bowed down, their eyes fixed on the
   </p>
   <p>
    ground; others wringing their hands, or beating their breasts; and all
   </p>
   <p>
    apparently suffering the utmost affliction of mind.
   </p>
   <p>
    Above the bottle there was a deep circular cell in the alcove, about
   </p>
   <p>
    fifteen inches in diameter; fitted in it was a metal ring, to which were
   </p>
   <p>
    attached golden strings, fine as gossamer threads: behind the first ring
   </p>
   <p>
    was a second, and further in still others, all stringed like the first,
   </p>
   <p>
    so that looking into the cell it appeared filled with a mist of golden
   </p>
   <p>
    cobweb.
   </p>
   <p>
    Drawing a cushioned seat to this secluded nook, where no person passing
   </p>
   <p>
    casually through the room would be able to see me, I sat down, and
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling too indolent to get myself a reading-stand, I supported the
   </p>
   <p>
    volume I had taken up to read on my knees. It was entitled Conduct
   </p>
   <p>
    and Ceremonial, and the subject-matter was divided into short
   </p>
   <p>
    sections, each with an appropriate heading. Turning over the leaves, and
   </p>
   <p>
    reading a sentence here and there in different sections, it occurred to
   </p>
   <p>
    me that this might prove a most useful work for me to study, whenever I
   </p>
   <p>
    could bring my mind into the right frame for such a task; for it
   </p>
   <p>
    contained minute instructions upon all points relating to individual
   </p>
   <p>
    conduct in the house--as the entertainment of pilgrims, the dress to be
   </p>
   <p>
    worn, and the conduct to be observed at the various annual festivals,
   </p>
   <p>
    with other matters of the kind. Glancing through it in this rapid way, I
   </p>
   <p>
    soon finished with the first volume, then went through the second in
   </p>
   <p>
    even less time, for many of the concluding sections related to
   </p>
   <p>
    lugubrious subjects which I did not care to linger over; the titles
   </p>
   <p>
    alone were enough to trouble me--Decay through Age, Ailments of Mind and
   </p>
   <p>
    of Body; then Death, and, finally, the Disposal of the Dead. This done I
   </p>
   <p>
    took up the third volume, the last of the series, the first portion of
   </p>
   <p>
    which was headed, Renewal of the Family. This part I began to
   </p>
   <p>
    examine with some attention, and pretty soon discovered that I had now
   </p>
   <p>
    at last accidentally stumbled upon a perfect mine of information of the
   </p>
   <p>
    precise kind I had so long and so vainly been seeking. Struggling to
   </p>
   <p>
    overcome my agitation I read on, hurrying through page after page with
   </p>
   <p>
    the greatest rapidity; for there was here much matter that had no
   </p>
   <p>
    special interest for me, but incidentally the things which concerned me
   </p>
   <p>
    most to know were touched on, and in some cases minutely explained. As I
   </p>
   <p>
    proceeded, the prophetic gloom which had oppressed me all that day, and
   </p>
   <p>
    for so many days before, darkened to the blackness of despair, and
   </p>
   <p>
    suddenly throwing up my arms, the book slipped from my knees and fell
   </p>
   <p>
    with a crash upon the floor. There, face downwards, with its beautiful
   </p>
   <p>
    leaves doubled and broken under its weight, it rested unheeded at my
   </p>
   <p>
    feet. For now the desired knowledge was mine, and that dream of
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness which had illumined my life was over. Now I possessed the
   </p>
   <p>
    secret of that passionless, everlasting calm of beings who had for ever
   </p>
   <p>
    outlived, and left as immeasurably far behind as the instincts of the
   </p>
   <p>
    wolf and ape, the strongest emotion of which my heart was capable. For
   </p>
   <p>
    the children of the house there could be no union by marriage; in body
   </p>
   <p>
    and soul they differed from me: they had no name for that feeling which
   </p>
   <p>
    I had so often and so vainly declared; therefore they had told me again
   </p>
   <p>
    and again that there was only one kind of love, for they, alas! could
   </p>
   <p>
    experience one kind only. I did not, for the moment, seek further in the
   </p>
   <p>
    book, or pause to reflect on that still unexplained mystery, which was
   </p>
   <p>
    the very center and core of the whole mater, namely, the existence of
   </p>
   <p>
    the father and mother in the house, from whose union the family was
   </p>
   <p>
    renewed, and who, fruitful themselves, were yet the parents of a barren
   </p>
   <p>
    race. Nor did I ask who their successors would be: for albeit
   </p>
   <p>
    long-lived, they were mortal like their own passionless children, and in
   </p>
   <p>
    this particular house their lives appeared now to be drawing to an end.
   </p>
   <p>
    These were questions I cared nothing about. It was enough to know that
   </p>
   <p>
    Yoletta could never love me as I loved her--that she could never be
   </p>
   <p>
    mine, body and soul, in my way and not in hers. With unspeakable
   </p>
   <p>
    bitterness I recalled my conversation with Chastel: now all her
   </p>
   <p>
    professions of affection and goodwill, all her schemes for smoothing my
   </p>
   <p>
    way and securing my happiness, seemed to me the veriest mockery, since
   </p>
   <p>
    even she had read my heart no better than the others, and that chill
   </p>
   <p>
    moonlight felicity, beyond which her children were powerless to imagine
   </p>
   <p>
    anything, had no charm for my passion-torn heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently, when I began to recover somewhat from my stupefaction, and to
   </p>
   <p>
    realize the magnitude of my loss, the misery of it almost drove me mad.
   </p>
   <p>
    I wished that I had never made this fatal discovery, that I might have
   </p>
   <p>
    continued still hoping and dreaming, and wearing out my heart with
   </p>
   <p>
    striving after the impossible, since any fate would have been preferable
   </p>
   <p>
    to the blank desolation which now confronted me. I even wished to
   </p>
   <p>
    possess the power of some implacable god or demon, that I might shatter
   </p>
   <p>
    the sacred houses of this later race, and destroy them everlastingly,
   </p>
   <p>
    and repeople the peaceful world with struggling, starving millions, as
   </p>
   <p>
    in the past, so that the beautiful flower of love which had withered in
   </p>
   <p>
    men's hearts might blossom again.
   </p>
   <p>
    While these insane thoughts were passing through my brain I had risen
   </p>
   <p>
    from my seat, and stood leaning against the edge of the alcove, with
   </p>
   <p>
    that curious richly-colored bottle close to my eyes. There were letters
   </p>
   <p>
    on it, noticed now for the first time--minute, hair-like lines beneath
   </p>
   <p>
    the strange-contrasted processionists depicted on the band--and even in
   </p>
   <p>
    my excited condition I was a little startled when these letters, forming
   </p>
   <p>
    the end of a sentence, shaped themselves into the words--and for the
   </p>
   <p>
    old life there shall be a new life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Turning the bottle round I read the whole sentence. When time and
   </p>
   <p>
    disease oppress, and the sun grows cold in heaven, and there is no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer any joy on the earth, and the fire of love grows cold in the
   </p>
   <p>
    heart, drink of me, and for the old life there shall be a new life.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Another important secret!" thought I; "this day has certainly been
   </p>
   <p>
    fruitful in discoveries. A panacea for all diseases, even for the
   </p>
   <p>
    disease of old age, so that a man may live two hundred years, and still
   </p>
   <p>
    find some pleasure in existence. But for me life has lost its savor, and
   </p>
   <p>
    I have no wish to last so long. There is more writing here--another
   </p>
   <p>
    secret perhaps, but I doubt very much that it will give me any comfort."
   </p>
   <p>
    When your soul is darkened, so that it is hard to know evil from
   </p>
   <p>
    good, and the thoughts that are in you lead to madness, drink of me, and
   </p>
   <p>
    be cured.
   </p>
   <p>
    "No, I shall not drink and be cured! Better a thousand times the
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts that lead to madness than this colorless existence without
   </p>
   <p>
    love. I do not wish to recover from so sweet a malady."
   </p>
   <p>
    I took the bottle in my hand and unstopped it. The stopper formed a
   </p>
   <p>
    curious little cup, round the rim of which was written, Drink of
   </p>
   <p>
    me. I poured some of the liquid out into the cup; it was pale yellow
   </p>
   <p>
    in color, and had a faint sickly smell as of honeysuckles. Then I poured
   </p>
   <p>
    it back again and replaced the bottle in its niche.
   </p>
   <p>
    Drink and be cured. No, not yet. Some day, perhaps, my trouble
   </p>
   <p>
    increasing till it might no longer be borne, would drive me to seek such
   </p>
   <p>
    dreary comfort as this cure-all bottle contained. To love without hope
   </p>
   <p>
    was sad enough, but to be without love was even sadder.
   </p>
   <p>
    I had grown calm now: the knowledge that I had it in my power to escape
   </p>
   <p>
    at once and for eyer from that rage of desire, had served to sober my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind, and at last I began to reason about the matter. The nature of my
   </p>
   <p>
    secret feelings could never be suspected, and in the unsubstantial realm
   </p>
   <p>
    of the imagination it would still be in my power to hide myself with my
   </p>
   <p>
    love, and revel in all supreme delight. Would not that be better than
   </p>
   <p>
    this cure--this calm contentment held out to me? And in time also my
   </p>
   <p>
    feelings would lose their present intensity, which often made them an
   </p>
   <p>
    agony, and would come at last to exist only as a gentle rapture stirring
   </p>
   <p>
    in my heart when I clasped my darling to my bosom and pressed her sweet
   </p>
   <p>
    lips with mine. Ah, no! that was a vain dream, I could not be deceived
   </p>
   <p>
    by it; for who can say to the demon of passion in him, thus far shalt
   </p>
   <p>
    thou go and no further?
   </p>
   <p>
    Perplexed in mind and unable to decide which thing was best, my troubled
   </p>
   <p>
    thoughts at length took me back to that far-off dead past, when the
   </p>
   <p>
    passion of love was so much in man's life. It was much; but in that
   </p>
   <p>
    over-populated world it divided the empire of his soul with a great,
   </p>
   <p>
    ever-growing misery--the misery of the hungry ones whose minds were
   </p>
   <p>
    darkened, through long years of decadence, with a sullen rage against
   </p>
   <p>
    God and man; and the misery of those who, wanting nothing, yet feared
   </p>
   <p>
    that the end of all things was coming to them.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the space of half an hour I pondered on these things, then said: "If
   </p>
   <p>
    I were to tell a hundredth part of this black retrospect to Yoletta,
   </p>
   <p>
    would not she bid me drink and forget, and herself pour out the divine
   </p>
   <p>
    liquor, and press it to my lips?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Again I took the bottle with trembling hand, and filled the same small
   </p>
   <p>
    cup to the brim, saying: "For your sake then, Yoletta, let me drink, and
   </p>
   <p>
    be cured; for this is what you desire, and you are more to me than life
   </p>
   <p>
    or passion or happiness. But when this consuming fire has left me--this
   </p>
   <p>
    feeling which until now burns and palpitates in every drop of my blood,
   </p>
   <p>
    every fiber of my being--I know that you shall still be to me a sweet,
   </p>
   <p>
    sacred sister and immaculate bride, worshipped more of my soul than any
   </p>
   <p>
    mother in the house; that loving and being loved by you shall be my one
   </p>
   <p>
    great joy all my life long."
   </p>
   <p>
    I drained the cup deliberately, then stopped the bottle and put it back
   </p>
   <p>
    in its place. The liquor was tasteless, but colder than ice, and made me
   </p>
   <p>
    shiver when I swallowed it. I began to wonder whether I would be
   </p>
   <p>
    conscious of the change it was destined to work in me or not; and then,
   </p>
   <p>
    half regretting what I had done, I wished that Yoletta would come to me,
   </p>
   <p>
    so that I might clasp her in my arms with all the old fervor once more,
   </p>
   <p>
    before that icy-cold liquor had done its work. Finally, I carefully
   </p>
   <p>
    raised the fallen book, and smoothed out its doubled leaves, regretting
   </p>
   <p>
    that I had injured it; and, sitting down again, I held the open volume
   </p>
   <p>
    as before, resting on my knees. Now, however, I perceived that it had
   </p>
   <p>
    opened at a place some pages in advance of the passages which had
   </p>
   <p>
    excited me; but, feeling no desire to go back to resume my reading just
   </p>
   <p>
    where I had left off, my eyes mechanically sought the top of the page
   </p>
   <p>
    before me, and this is what I read:
   </p>
   <p>
    "...make choice of one of the daughters of the house; it is fitting that
   </p>
   <p>
    she should rejoice for that brighter excellence which caused her to be
   </p>
   <p>
    raised to so high a state, and to have authority over all others, since
   </p>
   <p>
    in her, with the father, all the majesty and glory of the house is
   </p>
   <p>
    centered; albeit with a solemn and chastened joy, like that of the
   </p>
   <p>
    pilgrim who, journeying to some distant tropical region of the earth,
   </p>
   <p>
    and seeing the shores of his native country fading from sight, thinks at
   </p>
   <p>
    one and the same time of the unimaginable beauties of nature and art
   </p>
   <p>
    that fire his mind and call him away, and of the wide distance which
   </p>
   <p>
    will hold him for many years divided from all familiar scenes and the
   </p>
   <p>
    beings he loves best, and of the storms and perils of the great
   </p>
   <p>
    wilderness of waves, into which so many have ventured and have not
   </p>
   <p>
    returned. For now a changed body and soul shall separate her forever
   </p>
   <p>
    from those who were one in nature with her; and with that superior
   </p>
   <p>
    happiness destined to be hers there shall be the pains and perils of
   </p>
   <p>
    childbirth, with new griefs and cares unknown to those of humbler
   </p>
   <p>
    condition. But on that lesser gladness had by the children of the house
   </p>
   <p>
    in her exaltation, and because there will be a new mother in the
   </p>
   <p>
    house--one chosen from themselves--there shall be no cloud or shadow;
   </p>
   <p>
    and, taking her by the hand, and kissing her face in token of joy, and
   </p>
   <p>
    of that new filial love and obedience which will be theirs, they shall
   </p>
   <p>
    lead her to the Mother's Room, thereafter to be inhabited by her as long
   </p>
   <p>
    as life lasts. And she shall no longer serve in the house or suffer
   </p>
   <p>
    rebuke; but all shall serve her in love, and hold her in reverence, who
   </p>
   <p>
    is their predestined mother. And for the space of one year she shall be
   </p>
   <p>
    without authority in the house, being one apart, instructing herself in
   </p>
   <p>
    the secret books which it is not lawful for another to read, and
   </p>
   <p>
    observing day by day the directions contained therein, until that new
   </p>
   <p>
    knowledge and practice shall ripen her for that state she has been
   </p>
   <p>
    chosen to fill."
   </p>
   <p>
    * * * * *
   </p>
   <p>
    This passage was a fresh revelation to me. Again I recalled Chastel's
   </p>
   <p>
    words, her repeated assurances that she knew what was passing in my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind, that her eyes saw things more clearly than others could see them,
   </p>
   <p>
    that only by giving me the desire of my heart could the one remaining
   </p>
   <p>
    hope of her life be fulfilled. Now I seemed able to understand these
   </p>
   <p>
    dark sayings, and a new excitement, full of the joy of hope, sprang up
   </p>
   <p>
    in me, making me forget the misery I had so recently experienced, and
   </p>
   <p>
    even that increasing sensation of intense cold caused by the draught
   </p>
   <p>
    from the mysterious bottle.
   </p>
   <p>
    I continued reading, but the above passage was succeeded by minute
   </p>
   <p>
    instructions, extending over several pages, concerning the dress, both
   </p>
   <p>
    for ordinary and extraordinary occasions, to be worn by the chosen
   </p>
   <p>
    daughter during her year of preparation: the conduct to be observed by
   </p>
   <p>
    her towards other members of the family, also towards pilgrims visiting
   </p>
   <p>
    the house in the interval, with many other matters of secondary
   </p>
   <p>
    importance. Impatient to reach the end, I tried to turn the leaves
   </p>
   <p>
    rapidly, but now found that my arm had grown strangely stiff and cold,
   </p>
   <p>
    and seemed like an arm of iron when I raised it, so that the turning
   </p>
   <p>
    over of each leaf was an immense labor. Then I read yet another page,
   </p>
   <p>
    but with the utmost difficulty; for, notwithstanding the eagerness of my
   </p>
   <p>
    mind, my eyes began to remain more and more rigidly fixed on the center
   </p>
   <p>
    of the leaf, so that I could scarcely force them to follow the lines.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here I read that the bride-elect, her year of preparation being over,
   </p>
   <p>
    rises before daylight, and goes out alone to an appointed place at a
   </p>
   <p>
    great distance from the house, there to pass several hours in solitude
   </p>
   <p>
    and silence, communing with her own heart. Meanwhile, in the house all
   </p>
   <p>
    the others array themselves in purple garments, and go out singing at
   </p>
   <p>
    sunrise to gather flowers to adorn their heads; then, proceeding to the
   </p>
   <p>
    appointed spot, they seek for their new mother, and, finding her, lead
   </p>
   <p>
    her home with music and rejoicing.
   </p>
   <p>
    When, reading in this miserable, painful way, I had reached the bottom
   </p>
   <p>
    of the page, and attempted to turn it over, I found that I could no
   </p>
   <p>
    longer move my hand--my arms being now like arms of iron, absolutely
   </p>
   <p>
    devoid of sensation, while my hands, rigidly grasping the book like the
   </p>
   <p>
    hands of a frozen corpse, held it upright and motionless before me. I
   </p>
   <p>
    tried to start up and shake off this strange deadness from my body, but
   </p>
   <p>
    was powerless to move a muscle. What was the meaning of this condition?
   </p>
   <p>
    for I had absolutely no pain, no discomfort even; for the sensation of
   </p>
   <p>
    intense cold had almost ceased, and my mind was active and clear, and I
   </p>
   <p>
    could hear and see, and yet was as powerless as if I had been buried in
   </p>
   <p>
    a marble coffin a thousand fathoms deep in earth.
   </p>
   <p>
    Suddenly I remembered the draught from the bottle, and a terrible doubt
   </p>
   <p>
    shot through my heart. Alas! had I mistaken the meaning of those strange
   </p>
   <p>
    words I had read?--was death the cure which that mysterious
   </p>
   <p>
    vessel promised to those who drank of its contents? "When life becomes a
   </p>
   <p>
    burden, it is good to lay it down"; now too late the words of the
   </p>
   <p>
    father, when reproving me after my fever, came back to my mind in all
   </p>
   <p>
    their awful significance.
   </p>
   <p>
    All at once I heard a voice calling my name, and in a moment the tempest
   </p>
   <p>
    in me was stilled. Yes, it was my darling's voice--she was coming to
   </p>
   <p>
    me--she would save me in this dire extremity. Again and again she
   </p>
   <p>
    called, but the voice now sounded further and further away; and with
   </p>
   <p>
    ineffable anguish I remembered that she would not be able to see me
   </p>
   <p>
    where I sat. I tried to cry out, "Come quick, Yoletta, and save me from
   </p>
   <p>
    death!" but though I mentally repeated the words again and again in an
   </p>
   <p>
    extreme agony of terror, my frozen tongue refused to make a sound.
   </p>
   <p>
    Presently I heard a light, quick step on the floor, then Yoletta's clear
   </p>
   <p>
    voice.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Oh, I have found you at last!" she cried. "I have been seeking you all
   </p>
   <p>
    over the house. I have something glad to tell you--something to make you
   </p>
   <p>
    happier than on that day--do you remember?--when you saw me coming to
   </p>
   <p>
    you in the wood. The mother has left her chamber at last; she is in the
   </p>
   <p>
    Mother's Room again, waiting impatiently to see you. Come, come!"
   </p>
   <p>
    Her words sounded distinctly in my ears, and although I could not lift
   </p>
   <p>
    or turn my rigid eyes to see her, yet I seemed to see her now better
   </p>
   <p>
    than ever before, with some fresh glory, as of a new, unaccustomed
   </p>
   <p>
    gladness or excitement enhancing her unsurpassed loveliness, so clearly
   </p>
   <p>
    at that moment did her image shine in my soul! And not hers only, for
   </p>
   <p>
    now suddenly, by a miracle of the mind, the entire family appeared there
   </p>
   <p>
    before me; and in the midst sat Chastel, my sweet, suffering mother, as
   </p>
   <p>
    on that day after my illness when she had pardoned me, and put out her
   </p>
   <p>
    hand for me to kiss. As on that occasion, now--now she was gazing on me
   </p>
   <p>
    with such divine love and compassion in her eyes, her lips half parted,
   </p>
   <p>
    and a slight color flushing her pale face, recalling to it the bloom and
   </p>
   <p>
    radiance of which cruel disease had robbed her! And in my soul also, at
   </p>
   <p>
    that supreme moment, like a scene starting at the lightning's flash out
   </p>
   <p>
    of thick darkness, shone the image of the house, with all its wide,
   </p>
   <p>
    tranquil rooms rich in art and ancient memories, every stone within them
   </p>
   <p>
    glowing, with everlasting beauty--a house enduring as the green plains
   </p>
   <p>
    and rushing rivers and solemn woods and world-old hills amid which it
   </p>
   <p>
    was set like a sacred gem! O sweet abode of love and peace and purity of
   </p>
   <p>
    heart! O bliss surpassing that of the angels! O rich heritage, must I
   </p>
   <p>
    lose you for ever! Save me from death, Yoletta, my love, my bride--save
   </p>
   <p>
    me--save me--save me!
   </p>
   <p>
    Then something touched or fell on my neck, and at the same moment a
   </p>
   <p>
    deeper shadow passed over the page before me, with all its rich coloring
   </p>
   <p>
    floating formless, like vapors, mingling and separating, or dancing
   </p>
   <p>
    before my vision, like bright-winged insects hovering in the sunlight;
   </p>
   <p>
    and I knew that she was bending over me, her hand on my neck, her loose
   </p>
   <p>
    hair falling on my forehead.
   </p>
   <p>
    In that enforced stillness and silence I waited expectant for some
   </p>
   <p>
    moments.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then a great cry, as of one who suddenly sees a black phantom, rang out
   </p>
   <p>
    loud in the room, jarring my brain with the madness of its terror, and
   </p>
   <p>
    striking as with a hundred passionate hands on all the hidden harps in
   </p>
   <p>
    wall and roof; and the troubled sounds came back to me, now loud and now
   </p>
   <p>
    low, burdened with an infinite anguish and despair, as of voices of
   </p>
   <p>
    innumerable multitudes wandering in the sunless desolations of space,
   </p>
   <p>
    every voice reverberating anguish and despair; and the successive
   </p>
   <p>
    reverberations lifted me like waves and dropped me again, and the waves
   </p>
   <p>
    grew less and the sounds fainter, then fainter still, and died in
   </p>
   <p>
    everlasting silence.
