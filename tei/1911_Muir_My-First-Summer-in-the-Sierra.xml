     THROUGH THE FOOTHILLS WITH A FLOCK OF SHEEP
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_80">
     In the great Central Valley of California there are only two seasons—spring and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_90">
     summer. The spring begins with the first rainstorm, which usually falls in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_100">
     November. In a few months the wonderful flowery vegetation is in full bloom,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_110">
     and by the end of May it is dead and dry and crisp, as if every plant had been
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_120">
     roasted in an oven.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_130">
     Then the lolling, panting flocks and herds are driven to the high, cool, green
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_140">
     pastures of the Sierra. I was longing for the mountains about this time, but
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_150">
     money was scarce and I couldn't see how a bread supply was to be kept up.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_160">
     While I was anxiously brooding on the bread problem, so troublesome to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_170">
     wanderers, and trying to believe that I might learn to live like the wild animals,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_180">
     gleaning nourishment here and there from seeds, berries, etc., sauntering and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_190">
     climbing in joyful independence of money or baggage, Mr. Delaney, a sheepowner, for whom I had worked a few weeks, called on me, and offered to engage
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_200">
     me to go with his shepherd and flock to the headwaters of the Merced and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_210">
     Tuolumne rivers—the very region I had most in mind. I was in the mood to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_220">
     accept work of any kind that would take me into the mountains whose
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_230">
     treasures I had tasted last summer in the Yosemite region. The flock, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_240">
     explained, would be moved gradually higher through the successive forest belts
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_250">
     as the snow melted, stopping for a few weeks at the best places we came to.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_260">
     These I thought would be good centers of observation from which I might be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_270">
     able to make many telling excursions within a radius of eight or ten miles of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_280">
     the camps to learn something of the plants, animals, and rocks; for he assured
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_290">
     me that I should be left perfectly free to follow my studies. I judged, however,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_300">
     that I was in no way the right man for the place, and freely explained my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_310">
     shortcomings, confessing that I was wholly unacquainted with the topography
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_320">
     of the upper mountains, the streams that would have to be crossed, and the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_330">
     wild sheep-eating animals, etc.; in short that, what with bears, coyotes, rivers,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_340">
     cañons, and thorny, bewildering chaparral, I feared that half or more of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_350">
     flock would be lost. Fortunately these shortcom ings seemed insignificant to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_360">
     Mr. Delaney. The main thing, he said, was to have a man about the camp
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_370">
     whom he could trust to see that the shepherd did his duty, and he assured me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_380">
     that the difficulties that seemed so formidable at a distance would vanish as we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_390">
     went on; encouraging me further by saying that the shepherd would do all the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_400">
     herding, that I could study plants and rocks and scenery as much as I liked,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_410">
     and that he would himself accompany us to the first main camp and make
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_420">
     occasional visits to our higher ones to replenish our store of provisions and see
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_430">
     how we prospered. Therefore I concluded to go, though still fearing, when I saw
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_440">
     the silly sheep bouncing one by one through the narrow gate of the home corral
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_450">
     to be counted, that of the two thousand and fifty many would never return.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_460">
     I was fortunate in getting a fine St. Bernard dog for a companion. His master, a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_470">
     hunter with whom I was slightly acquainted, came to me as soon as he heard
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_480">
     that I was going to spend the summer in the Sierra and begged me to take his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_490">
     favorite dog, Carlo, with me, for he feared that if he were compelled to stay all
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_500">
     summer on the plains the fierce heat might be the death of him. "I think I can
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_510">
     trust you to be kind to him," he said, "and I am sure he will be good to you. He
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_520">
     knows all about the moun tain animals, will guard the camp, assist in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_530">
     managing the sheep, and in every way be found able and faithful." Carlo knew
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_540">
     we were talking about him, watched our faces, and listened so attentively that I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_550">
     fancied he understood us. Calling him by name, I asked him if he was willing to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_560">
     go with me. He looked me in the face with eyes expressing wonderful
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_570">
     intelligence, then turned to his master, and after permission was given by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_580">
     wave of the hand toward me and a farewell patting caress, he quietly followed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_590">
     me as if he perfectly understood all that had been said and had known me
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_600">
     always.

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_620">
     were packed on two horses, the flock headed for the tawny foothills, and away
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_630">
     we sauntered in a cloud of dust: Mr. Delaney, bony and tall, with sharply
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_640">
     hacked profile like Don Quixote, leading the pack-horses, Billy, the proud
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_650">
     shepherd, a Chinaman and a Digger Indian to assist in driving for the first few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_660">
     days in the brushy foothills, and myself with notebook tied to my belt.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_670">
     The home ranch from which we set out is on the south side of the Tuolumne
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_680">
     River near French Bar, where the foothills of metamorphic gold-bearing slates
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_690">
     dip below the stratified deposits of the Central Valley. We had not gone more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_700">
     than a mile before some of the old leaders of the flock showed by the eager,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_710">
     inquiring way they ran and looked ahead that they were thinking of the high
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_720">
     pastures they had enjoyed last summer. Soon the whole flock seemed to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_730">
     hopefully excited, the mothers calling their lambs, the lambs replying in tones
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_740">
     wonderfully human, their fondly quavering calls interrupted now and then by
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_750">
     hastily snatched mouthfuls of withered grass. Amid all this seeming babel of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_760">
     baas as they streamed over the hills every mother and child recognized each
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_770">
     other's voice. In case a tired lamb, half asleep in the smothering dust, should
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_780">
     fail to answer, its mother would come running back through the flock toward
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_790">
     the spot whence its last response was heard, and refused to be comforted until
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_800">
     she found it, the one of a thousand, though to our eyes and ears all seemed
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_810">
     alike.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_820">
     The flock traveled at the rate of about a mile an hour, outspread in the form of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_830">
     an irregular triangle, about a hundred yards wide at the base, and a hundred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_840">
     and fifty yards long, with a crooked, ever-changing point made up of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_850">
     strongest foragers, called the "leaders," which, with the most active of those
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_860">
     scattered along the ragged sides of the "main body," hastily explored nooks in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_870">
     the rocks and bushes for grass and leaves; the lambs and feeble old mothers
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_880">
     dawdling in the rear were called the "tail end."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_890">
     Sheep in the Mountains
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_900">
     About noon the heat was hard to bear; the poor sheep panted pitifully and tried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_910">
     to stop in the shade of every tree they came to, while we gazed with eager
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_920">
     longing through the dim burning glare toward the snowy mountains and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_930">
     streams, though not one was in sight. The landscape is only wavering foothills
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_940">
     roughened here and there with bushes and trees and outcropping masses of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_950">
     slate. The trees, mostly the blue oak Quercus Douglasii, are about thirty to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_960">
     forty feet high, with pale blue-green leaves and white bark, sparsely planted on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_970">
     the thinnest soil or in crevices of rocks beyond the reach of grass fires. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_980">
     slates in many places rise abruptly through the tawny grass in sharp lichencovered slabs like tombstones in deserted burying-grounds. With the exception
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_990">
     of the oak and four or five species of manzanita and ceanothus, the vegetation
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1000">
     of the foothills is mostly the same as that of the plains. I saw this region in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1010">
     early spring, when it was a charming landscape garden full of birds and bees
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1020">
     and flowers. Now the scorching weather makes everything dreary. The ground
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1030">
     is full of cracks, lizards glide about on the rocks, and ants in amazing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1040">
     numbers, whose tiny sparks of life only burn the brighter with the heat, fairly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1050">
     quiver with unquenchable energy as they run in long lines to fight and gather
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1060">
     food. How it comes that they do not dry to a crisp in a few seconds' exposure to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1070">
     such sun-fire is marvelous. A few rattlesnakes lie coiled in out-of-the-way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1080">
     places, but are seldom seen. Magpies and crows, usually so noisy, are silent
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1090">
     now, standing in mixed flocks on the ground beneath the best shade trees,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1100">
     with bills wide open and wings drooped, too breathless to speak; the quails also
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1110">
     are trying to keep in the shade about the few tepid alkaline water-holes;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1120">
     cottontail rabbits are running from shade to shade among the ceanothus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1130">
     brush, and occasionally the long-eared hare is seen cantering gracefully across
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1140">
     the wider openings.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1150">
     After a short noon rest in a grove, the poor dust-choked flock was again driven
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1160">
     ahead over the brushy hills, but the dim roadway we had been following faded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1170">
     away just where it was most needed, compelling us to stop to look about us
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1180">
     and get our bearings. The Chinaman seemed to think we were lost, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1190">
     chattered in pidgin English concerning the abundance of "litty stick" chaparral,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1200">
     while the Indian silently scanned the billowy ridges and gulches for openings.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1210">
     Pushing through the thorny jungle, we at length discovered a road trending
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1220">
     toward Coulterville, which we followed until an hour before sunset, when we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1230">
     reached a dry ranch and camped for the night.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1240">
     Camping in the foothills with a flock of sheep is simple and easy, but far from
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1250">
     pleasant. The sheep were allowed to pick what they could find in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1260">
     neighborhood until after sunset, watched by the shepherd, while the others
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1270">
     gathered wood, made a fire, cooked, unpacked and fed the horses, etc. About
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1280">
     dusk the weary sheep were gathered on the highest open spot near camp,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1290">
     where they willingly bunched close together, and after each mother had found
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1300">
     her lamb and suckled it, all lay down and required no attention until morning.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1310">
     Supper was announced by the call, "Grub!" Each with a tin plate helped
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_1320">

     while the climate is so favorable that no winter food supply, shelter-pens, or

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_3530">
     boils a handful of tea, and perhaps fries a few strips of rusty bacon. Usually

     with kings. The oriental shepherd, we read, called his sheep by name; they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_3660">
     knew his voice and followed him. The flocks must have been small and easily

     managed, allowing piping on the hills and ample leisure for reading and

     thinking. But whatever the blessings of sheep-culture in other times and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4200">
     whether Indian or some poacher on his wide domain. His dog Sandy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4210">
     accompanied him everywhere, and well the little hairy mountaineer knew and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4220">
     loved his master and his master's aims. In deer-hunting he had but little to do,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4230">
     trot ting behind his master as he slowly made his way through the wood,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4240">
     careful not to step heavily on dry twigs, scanning open spots in the chaparral,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4250">
     where the game loves to feed in the early morning and towards sunset; peering
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4260">
     cautiously over ridges as new outlooks were reached, and along the meadowy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4270">
     borders of streams. But when bears were hunted, little Sandy became more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4280">
     important, and it was as a bear-hunter that Brown became famous. His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4290">
     hunting method, as described by Mr. Delaney, who had passed many a night
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4300">
     with him in his lonely cabin and learned his stories, was simply to go slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4310">
     and silently through the best bear pastures, with his dog and rifle and a few
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4320">
     pounds of flour, until he found a fresh track and then follow it to the death,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4330">
     paying no heed to the time required. Wherever the bear went he followed, led
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4340">
     by little Sandy, who had a keen nose and never lost the track, however rocky
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4350">
     the ground. When high open points were reached, the likeliest places were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4360">
     carefully scanned. The time of year enabled the hunter to determine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4370">
     approximately where the bear would be found,—in the spring and early
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4380">
     summer on open spots about the banks of streams and springy places eating
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4390">
     grass and clover and lupines, or in dry meadows feasting on strawberries;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4400">
     toward the end of summer, on dry ridges, feasting on manzanita berries,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4410">
     sitting on his haunches, pulling down the laden branches with his paws, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4420">
     pressing them together so as to get good compact mouthfuls however much
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4430">
     mixed with twigs and leaves; in the Indian summer, beneath the pines,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4440">
     chewing the cones cut off by the squirrels, or occasionally climbing a tree to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4450">
     gnaw and break off the fruitful branches. In late autumn, when acorns are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4460">
     ripe, Bruin's favorite feeding-grounds are groves of the California oak in parklike cañon flats. Always the cunning hunter knew where to look, and seldom
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4470">
     came upon Bruin unawares. When the hot scent showed the dangerous game
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4480">
     was nigh, a long halt was made, and the intricacies of the topography and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4490">
     vegetation leisurely scanned to catch a glimpse of the shaggy wanderer, or to at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4500">
     least determine where he was most likely to be.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4510">
     "Whenever," said the hunter, "I saw a bear before it saw me I had no trouble in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4520">
     killing it. I just studied the lay of the land and got to leeward of it no matter
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4530">
     how far around I had to go, and then worked up to within a few hundred yards
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4540">
     or so, at the foot of a tree that I could easily climb, but too small for the bear to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4550">
     climb. Then I looked well to the condition of my rifle, took off my boots so as to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4560">
     climb well if necessary, and waited until the bear turned its side in clear view
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4570">
     when I could make a sure or at least a good shot. In case it showed fight I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4580">
     climbed out of reach. But bears are slow and awkward with their eyes, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4590">
     being to leeward of them they could not scent me, and I often got in a second
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4600">
     shot before they noticed the smoke. Usually, however, they run when wounded
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4610">
     and hide in the brush. I let them run a good safe time before I ventured to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4620">
     follow them, and Sandy was pretty sure to find them dead. If not, he barked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4630">
     and drew their attention, and occasionally rushed in for a distracting bite, so
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4640">
     that I was able to get to a safe distance for a final shot. Oh yes, bear-hunting is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4650">
     safe enough when followed in a safe way, though like every other business it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_4660">
     has its accidents, and little doggie and I have had some close calls. Bears like

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17390">
     sheet of glacier-polished granite, a firm foundation for beds. Saw the tracks of a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17400">
     very large bear on the trail, and the Don talked of bears in general. I said I

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17450">
     catch the scent, showing how fully they have inherited a knowledge of their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17460">
     enemy. Hogs, mules, horses, and cattle are afraid of bears, and are seized with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17470">
     ungovernable terror when they approach, particularly hogs and mules. Hogs
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17480">
     are frequently driven to pastures in the foothills of the Coast Range and Sierra
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17490">
     where acorns are abundant, and are herded in droves of hundreds like sheep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17500">
     When a bear comes to the range they promptly leave it, emigrating in a body,
    </p>

     usually in the night time, the keepers being powerless to prevent; they thus
    </p>

     show more sense than sheep, that simply scatter in the rocks and brush and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17530">
     await their fate. Mules flee like the wind with or without riders when they see a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17540">
     bear, and, if picketed, sometimes break their necks in trying to break their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17550">
     ropes, though I have not heard of bears killing mules or horses. Of hogs they
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17560">
     are said to be particularly fond, bolting small ones, bones and all, without
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17570">
     choice of parts. In particular, Mr. Delaney assured me that all kinds of bears in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17580">
     the Sierra are very shy, and that hunters found far greater difficulty in getting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17590">
     within gunshot of them than of deer or indeed any other animal in the Sierra,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17600">
     and if I was anxious to see much of them I should have to wait and watch with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17610">
     endless Indian patience and pay no attention to anything else.

     nearly silent, it glides with stately gestures, a dense growth of the slender twoleaved pine along its banks, and a fringe of willow, purple spirea, sedges,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17760">
     daisies, lilies, and columbines. Some of the sedges and willow boughs dip into

     washed gravelly sand which seems to have been deposited by some ancient

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_17800">
     more flowers than leaves, forming an even growth, slightly dimpled and ruffled

     breaking back in scores and hundreds, leaving the beauty of the banks sadly

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18300">
     into the water.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18310">
     In a few hours the inclosure was completed, and the silly animals were driven
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18320">
     in and rammed hard against the brink of the ford. Then the Don, forcing a way
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18330">
     through the compacted mass, pitched a few of the terrified unfortunates into
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18340">
     the stream by main strength; but instead of crossing over, they swam about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18350">
     close to the bank, making desperate attempts to get back into the flock. Then a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18360">
     dozen or more were shoved off, and the Don, tall like a crane and a good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18370">
     natural wader, jumped in after them, seized a struggling wether, and dragged it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18380">
     to the opposite shore. But no sooner did he let it go than it jumped into the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18390">
     stream and swam back to its frightened companions in the corral, thus
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18400">
     manifesting sheep-nature as unchangeable as gravitation. Pan with his pipes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18410">
     would have had no better luck, I fear. We were now pretty well baffled. The silly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18420">
     creatures would suffer any sort of death rather than cross that stream. Calling
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18430">
     a council, the dripping Don declared that starvation was now the only likely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18440">
     scheme to try, and that we might as well camp here in comfort and let the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18450">
     besieged flock grow hungry and cool, and come to their senses, if they had any.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18460">
     In a few minutes after being thus let alone, an adventurer in the foremost rank
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18470">
     plunged in and swam bravely to the farther shore. Then suddenly all rushed in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18480">
     pell-mell together, trampling one another under water, while we vainly tried to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18490">
     hold them back. The Don jumped into the thickest of the gasping, gurgling,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18500">
     drowning mass, and shoved them right and left as if each sheep was a piece of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18510">
     floating timber. The current also served to drift them apart; a long bent column
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18520">
     was soon formed, and in a few minutes all were over and began baaing and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18530">
     feeding as if nothing out of the common had happened. That none were
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18540">
     drowned seems wonderful. I fully expected that hundreds would gain the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18550">
     romantic fate of being swept into Yosemite over the highest waterfall in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18560">
     world.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18570">
     As the day was far spent, we camped a little way back from the ford, and let the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18580">
     dripping flock scatter and feed until sundown. The wool is dry now, and calm,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18590">
     cud-chewing peace has fallen on all the comfortable band, leaving no trace of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18600">
     the watery battle. I have seen fish driven out of the water with less ado than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18610">
     was made in driving these animals into it. Sheep brain must surely be poor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18620">
     stuff. Compare today's exhibition with the performances of deer swimming
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18630">
     quietly across broad and rapid rivers, and from island to island in seas and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18640">
     lakes; or with dogs, or even with the squirrels that, as the story goes, cross the

     Mississippi River on selected chips, with tails for sails comfortably trimmed to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18660">
     the breeze. A sheep can hardly be called an animal; an entire flock is required

     July . Followed the Mono Trail up the eastern rim of the basin nearly to its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18700">
     summit, then turned off southward to a small shallow valley that extends to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18710">
     the edge of the Yosemite, which we reached about noon, and encamped. After
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18720">
     luncheon I made haste to high ground, and from the top of the ridge on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18730">
     west side of Indian Cañon gained the noblest view of the summit peaks I have
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18740">
     ever yet enjoyed. Nearly all the upper basin of the Merced was displayed, with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18750">
     its sublime domes and cañons, dark upsweeping forests, and glorious array of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18760">
     white peaks deep in the sky, every feature glowing, radiating beauty that pours
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18770">
     into our flesh and bones like heat rays from fire. Sunshine over all; no breath
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18780">
     of wind to stir the brooding calm. Never before had I seen so glorious a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18790">
     landscape, so boundless an affluence of sublime mountain beauty. The most
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18800">
     extravagant description I might give of this view to any one who has not seen
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18810">
     similar landscapes with his own eyes would not so much as hint its grandeur
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18820">
     and the spiritual glow that covered it. I shouted and gestic ulated in a wild
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18830">
     burst of ecstasy, much to the astonishment of St. Bernard Carlo, who came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18840">
     running up to me, manifesting in his intelligent eyes a puzzled concern that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18850">
     was very ludicrous, which had the effect of bringing me to my senses. A brown
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18860">
     bear, too, it would seem, had been a spectator of the show I had made of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18870">
     myself, for I had gone but a few yards when I started one from a thicket of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18880">
     brush. He evidently considered me dangerous, for he ran away very fast,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18890">
     tumbling over the tops of the tangled manzanita bushes in his haste. Carlo
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18900">
     drew back, with his ears depressed as if afraid, and kept looking me in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18910">
     face, as if expecting me to pursue and shoot, for he had seen many a bear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18920">
     battle in his day.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18930">
     Following the ridge, which made a gradual descent to the south, I came at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18940">
     length to the brow of that massive cliff that stands between Indian Cañon and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18950">
     Yosemite Falls, and here the far-famed valley came suddenly into view
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18960">
     throughout almost its whole extent. The noble walls—sculptured into endless
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18970">
     variety of domes and gables, spires and battlements and plain mural
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18980">
     precipices—all a-tremble with the thunder tones of the falling water. The level
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_18990">
     bottom seemed to be dressed like a garden—sunny meadows here and there,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19000">
     and groves of pine and oak; the river of Mercy sweeping in majesty through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19010">
     midst of them and flashing back the sunbeams. The great Tissiack, or HalfDome, rising at the upper end of the valley to a height of nearly a mile, is nobly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19020">
     proportioned and life-like, the most impressive of all the rocks, holding the eye
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19030">
     in devout admiration, calling it back again and again from falls or meadows, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19040">
     even the mountains beyond,—marvelous cliffs, marvelous in sheer dizzy depth
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19050">
     and sculpture, types of endurance. Thousands of years have they stood in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19060">
     sky exposed to rain, snow, frost, earthquake and avalanche, yet they still wear
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19070">
     the bloom of youth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19080">
     I rambled along the valley rim to the westward; most of it is rounded off on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19090">
     very brink, so that it is not easy to find places where one may look clear down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19100">
     the face of the wall to the bottom. When such places were found, and I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19110">
     cautiously set my feet and drawn my body erect, I could not help fearing a little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19120">
     that the rock might split off and let me down, and what a down!—more than
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19130">
     three thousand feet. Still my limbs did not tremble, nor did I feel the least
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19140">
     uncertainty as to the reliance to be placed on them. My only fear was that a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19150">
     flake of the granite, which in some places showed joints more or less open and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19160">
     running parallel with the face of the cliff, might give way. After withdrawing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19170">
     from such places, excited with the view I had got, I would say to myself, "Now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19180">
     don't go out on the verge again." But in the face of Yosemite scenery cautious
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19190">
     remonstrance is vain; under its spell one's body seems to go where it likes with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19200">
     a will over which we seem to have scarce any control.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19210">
     After a mile or so of this memorable cliff work I approached Yosemite Creek,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19220">
     admiring its easy, graceful, confident gestures as it comes bravely forward in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19230">
     its narrow channel, singing the last of its mountain songs on its way to its
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19240">
     fate—a few rods more over the shining granite, then down half a mile in showy
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19250">
     foam to another world, to be lost in the Merced, where climate, vegetation,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19260">
     inhabitants, all are different. Emerging from its last gorge, it glides in wide
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19270">
     lace-like rapids down a smooth incline into a pool where it seems to rest and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19280">
     compose its gray, agitated waters before taking the grand plunge, then slowly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19290">
     slipping over the lip of the pool basin, it descends another glossy slope with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19300">
     rapidly accelerated speed to the brink of the tremendous cliff, and with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19310">
     sublime, fateful confidence springs out free in the air.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19320">
     I took off my shoes and stockings and worked my way cautiously down
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19330">
     alongside the rushing flood, keeping my feet and hands pressed firmly on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19340">
     polished rock. The booming, roaring water, rushing past close to my head, was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19350">
     very exciting. I had expected that the sloping apron would terminate with the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19360">
     perpendicular wall of the valley, and that from the foot of it, where it is less
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19370">
     steeply inclined, I should be able to lean far enough out to see the forms and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19380">
     behavior of the fall all the way down to the bottom. But I found that there was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19390">
     yet another small brow over which I could not see, and which appeared to be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19400">
     too steep for mortal feet. Scanning it keenly, I discovered a narrow shelf about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19410">
     three inches wide on the very brink, just wide enough for a rest for one's heels.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19420">
     But there seemed to be no way of reaching it over so steep a brow. At length,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19430">
     after careful scrutiny of the surface, I found an irregular edge of a flake of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19440">
     rock some distance back from the margin of the torrent. If I was to get down to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19450">
     the brink at all that rough edge, which might offer slight finger-holds, was the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19460">
     only way. But the slope beside it looked dangerously smooth and steep, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19470">
     the swift roaring flood beneath, overhead, and beside me was very nerve-trying.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19480">
     I therefore concluded not to venture farther, but did nevertheless. Tufts of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19490">
     artemisia were growing in clefts of the rock near by, and I filled my mouth with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19500">
     the bitter leaves, hoping they might help to prevent giddiness. Then, with a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19510">
     caution not known in ordinary cir cumstances, I crept down safely to the little
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19520">
     ledge, got my heels well planted on it, then shuffled in a horizontal direction
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19530">
     twenty or thirty feet until close to the outplunging current, which, by the time
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19540">
     it had descended thus far, was already white. Here I obtained a perfectly free
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19550">
     view down into the heart of the snowy, chanting throng of comet-like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19560">
     streamers, into which the body of the fall soon separates.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19570">
     While perched on that narrow niche I was not distinctly conscious of danger.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19580">
     The tremendous grandeur of the fall in form and sound and motion, acting at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19590">
     close range, smothered the sense of fear, and in such places one's body takes
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19600">
     keen care for safety on its own account. How long I remained down there, or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19610">
     how I returned, I can hardly tell. Anyhow I had a glorious time, and got back to

     camp about dark, enjoying triumphant exhilaration soon followed by dull

     July . My enjoyments yesterday afternoon, especially at the head of the fall,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19700">
     were too great for good sleep. Kept starting up last night in a nervous tremor,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_19710">
     half awake, fancying that the foundation of the mountain we were camped on
    </p>

     avalanche of water and rocks. One time, springing to my feet, I said, "This time

     We were pelted about noon by a short, heavy rainstorm, sublime thunder

     reverberating among the mountains and cañons,—some strokes near, crashing,

     ringing in the tense crisp air with startling keenness, while the distant peaks
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_20040">

     July . Slept pretty well; the valley walls did not seem to fall, though I still
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_20120">
     fancied myself at the brink, alongside the white, plunging flood, especially
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_20130">

     clanging notes gradually fading into low bass rolling and muttering in the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_20200">
     then hail; some of the hailstones an inch in diameter, hard, icy, and irregular

     intelligent astonishment as they came pelting and thrashing through the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_20230">
     quivering branches of the trees. The cloud scenery sublime. Afternoon calm,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_22370">
     played his part, harmonizing in bulk and color and shaggy hair with the trunks

     of the trees and lush vegetation, as natural a feature as any other in the

     inquiringly forward, the long shaggy hair on his broad chest, the stiff, erect

     running. On the contrary, he stood his ground ready to fight and defend

     jumped up full of the idea of meeting him, with almost as much startling

     named no meeting-place, and gave no directions as to the course he would

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29710">
     whatever else it may be called, was true; for, strange to say, he had just

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29720">
     entered the valley by way of the Coulterville Trail and was coming up the valley

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29750">
     me jump up from my work and run toward him. This seems the one welldefined marvel of my life of the kind called supernatural; for, absorbed in glad

     two years among strangers; got on a clean pair of overalls, a cashmere shirt,

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29830">
     and a sort of jacket,—the best my camp wardrobe afforded,—tied my notebook

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29840">
     on my belt, and strode away on my strange journey, followed by Carlo. I made
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29850">
     my way though the gap discovered last evening, which proved to be Indian

     Cañon. There was no trail in it, and the rocks and brush were so rough that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29870">
     Carlo frequently called me back to help him down precipitous places. Emerging
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29880">
     from the cañon shadows, I found a man making hay on one of the meadows,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29890">
     and asked him whether Professor Butler was in the valley. "I don't know," he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29900">
     replied; "but you can easily find out at the hotel. There are but few visitors in

     the valley just now. A small party came in yesterday afternoon, and I heard

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29920">
     some one called Professor Butler, or Butterfield, or some name like that."

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29960">
     dropping down through the trees from the clouds, mostly, I suppose, on
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29970">
     account of my strange garb. Inquiring for the office, I was told it was locked,

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_29990">
     in the parlor. I entered in a sad state of embarrassment, and after I had waited
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30000">
     in the big, empty room and knocked at several doors the landlady at length

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30030">
     office. Among the names of the last arrivals I soon discovered the Professor's
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30040">
     familiar handwriting, at the sight of which bashfulness vanished; and having
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30050">
     learned that his party had gone up the valley,—probably to the Vernal and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30070">
     less than an hour I reached the head of the Nevada Cañon at the Vernal Fall,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30080">
     and just outside of the spray discovered a distinguished-looking gentleman,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30090">
     who, like everybody else I have seen to-day, regarded me curiously as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30100">
     approached. When I made bold to inquire if he knew where Professor Butler
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30110">
     was, he seemed yet more curious to know what could possibly have happened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30120">
     that required a messenger for the Professor, and instead of answering my
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30130">
     question he asked with military sharpness, "Who wants him?" "I want him," I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30140">
     replied with equal sharp ness. "Why? Do you know him?" "Yes," I said. "Do you
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30150">
     know him?" Astonished that any one in the mountains could possibly know
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30160">
     Professor Butler and find him as soon as he had reached the valley, he came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30170">
     down to meet the strange mountaineer on equal terms, and courteously
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30180">
     replied, "Yes, I know Professor Butler very well. I am General Alvord, and we
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30190">
     were fellow students in Rutland, Vermont, long ago, when we were both
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30200">
     young." "But where is he now?" I persisted, cutting short his story. "He has
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30210">
     gone beyond the falls with a companion, to try to climb that big rock, the top of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30220">
     which you see from here." His guide now volunteered the information that it
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30230">
     was the Liberty Cap Professor Butler and his companion had gone to climb,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30240">
     and that if I waited at the head of the fall I should be sure to find them on their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30250">
     way down. I therefore climbed the ladders alongside the Vernal Fall, and was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30260">
     pushing forward, determined to go to the top of Liberty Cap rock in my hurry,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30270">
     rather than wait, if I should not meet my friend sooner. So heart-hungry at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30280">
     times may one be to see a friend in the flesh, however happily full and care-free
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30290">
     one's life may be. I had gone but a short distance, however, above the brow of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30300">
     the Vernal Fall when I caught sight of him in the brush and rocks, half erect,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30310">
     groping his way, his sleeves rolled up, vest open, hat in his hand, evidently
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30320">
     very hot and tired. When he saw me coming he sat down on a boulder to wipe
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30330">
     the perspiration from his brow and neck, and taking me for one of the valley
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30340">
     guides, he inquired the way to the fall ladders. I pointed out the path marked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30350">
     with little piles of stones, on seeing which he called his companion, saying that
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30360">
     the way was found; but he did not yet recognize me. Then I stood directly in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30370">
     front of him, looked him in the face, and held out my hand. He thought I was
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30380">
     offering to assist him in rising. "Never mind," he said. Then I said, "Professor
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30390">
     Butler, don't you know me?" "I think not," he replied; but catching my eye,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30400">
     sudden recognition followed, and astonishment that I should have found him
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30410">
     just when he was lost in the brush and did not know that I was within
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30420">
     hundreds of miles of him. "John Muir, John Muir, where have you come from?"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30430">
     Then I told him the story of my feeling his presence when he entered the valley
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30440">
     last evening, when he was four or five miles distant, as I sat sketching on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30450">
     North Dome. This, of course, only made him wonder the more. Below the foot of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30460">
     the Vernal Fall the guide was waiting with his saddle-horse, and I walked along
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30470">
     the trail, chatting all the way back to the hotel, talking of school days, friends
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30480">
     in Madison, of the students, how each had prospered, etc., ever and anon
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30490">
     gazing at the stupendous rocks about us, now growing indistinct in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30500">
     gloaming, and again quoting from the poets—a rare ramble.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30510">
     It was late ere we reached the hotel, and General Alvord was waiting the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30520">
     Professor's arrival for dinner. When I was introduced he seemed yet more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30530">
     astonished than the Professor at my descent from cloudland and going straight
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30540">
     to my friend without knowing in any ordinary way that he was even in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30550">
     California. They had come on direct from the East, had not yet visited any of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30560">
     their friends in the state, and considered themselves undiscoverable. As we sat
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30570">
     at dinner, the General leaned back in his chair, and looking down the table,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30580">
     thus introduced me to the dozen guests or so, including the staring fisherman
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30590">
     mentioned above: "This man, you know, came down out of these huge,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30600">
     trackless mountains, you know, to find his friend Professor Butler here, the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30610">
     very day he arrived; and how did he know he was here? He just felt him, he
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30620">
     says. This is the queerest case of Scotch farsightedness I ever heard of," etc.,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30630">
     etc. While my friend quoted Shakespeare: "More things in heaven and earth,

     Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philos ophy," "As the sun, ere he has risen,

     precede the events, and in to-day already walks to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30670">
     Had a long conversation, after dinner, over Madison days. The Professor wants
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30680">
     me to promise to go with him, sometime, on a camping trip in the Hawaiian
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30690">
     Islands, while I tried to get him to go back with me to camp in the high Sierra.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30700">
     But he says, "Not now." He must not leave the General; and I was surprised to

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_30710">
     learn they are to leave the valley to-morrow or next day. I'm glad I'm not great

    </p>

     part, and invited me to visit him in Omaha. Calling Carlo, I scrambled home

     through the Indian Cañon gate, rejoicing, pitying the poor Professor and

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_31680">
     up, Carlo and I groped our way through the woods, guided by the rustling

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_31690">
     sound made by fragments of the flock, not fearing the bear, for I knew that the

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_31730">
     to the westward, we traced another band of fugitives and got them back to the
    </p>

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_31840">
     hundred yards or so back from the corral, and eaten their fill. After breakfast I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_31850">
     set out to seek more of the lost, and found seventy-five at a considerable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_31860">
     distance from camp. In the afternoon I succeeded, with Carlo's help, in getting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_31870">
     them back to the flock. I don't know whether all are together again or not. I

     On my return after sunset to the Portuguese camp I found the shepherds
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34580">
     greatly excited over the behavior of the bears that have learned to like mutton.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34620">
     driving the flock toward camp half an hour before sunset, a hungry bear came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34630">
     out of the chaparral within a few yards of them and shuffled deliberately
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34640">
     toward the flock. "Portuguese Joe," who always carried a gun loaded with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34650">
     buckshot, fired excitedly, threw down his gun, fled to the nearest suitable tree,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34660">
     and climbed to a safe height without waiting to see the effect of his shot. His
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34670">
     companion also ran, but said that he saw the bear rise on its hind legs and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34680">
     throw out its arms as if feeling for somebody, and then go into the brush as if
    </p>

     wounded.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34700">
     At another of their camps in this neighborhood, a bear with two cubs attacked
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34710">
     the flock before sunset, just as they were approaching the corral. Joe promptly
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34720">
     climbed a tree out of danger, while Antone, rebuking his companion for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34730">
     cowardice in abandoning his charge, said that he was not going to let bears
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34740">
     "eat up his sheeps" in daylight, and rushed towards the bears, shouting and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34750">
     setting his dog on them. The frightened cubs climbed a tree, but the mother
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34760">
     ran to meet the shepherd and seemed anxious to fight. Antone stood
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34770">
     astonished for a moment, eyeing the oncoming bear, then turned and fled,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34780">
     closely pursued. Unable to reach a suitable tree for climbing, he ran to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34790">
     camp and scrambled up to the roof of the little cabin; the bear followed, but did
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34800">
     not climb to the roof,—only stood glaring up at him for a few minutes,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34810">
     threatening him and holding him in mortal terror, then went to her cubs, called
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34820">
     them down, went to the flock, caught a sheep for supper, and vanished in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34830">
     brush. As soon as the bear left the cabin, the trembling Antone begged Joe to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34840">
     show him a good safe tree, up which he climbed like a sailor climbing a mast,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34850">
     and remained as long as he could hold on, the tree being almost branchless.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34860">
     After these disastrous experiences the two shepherds chopped and gathered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34870">
     large piles of dry wood and made a ring of fire around the corral every night,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34880">
     while one with a gun kept watch from a comfortable stage built on a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34890">
     neighboring pine that commanded a view of the corral. This evening the show
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34900">
     made by the circle of fire was very fine, bringing out the surrounding trees in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34910">
     most impressive relief, and making the thousands of sheep eyes glow like a

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34940">
     expected the shaggy freebooters every minute. They did not come till near
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34950">
     midnight, when a pair walked boldly to the corral between two of the great
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34960">
     fires, climbed in, killed two sheep and smothered ten, while the frightened
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34970">
     watcher in the tree did not fire a single shot, saying that he was afraid he might
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34980">
     kill some of the sheep, for the bears got into the corral before he got a good
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_34990">
     clear view of them. I told the shepherds they should at once move the flock to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35000">
     another camp. "Oh, no use, no use," they lamented; "where we go, the bears go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35010">
     too. See my poor dead sheeps—soon all dead. No use try another camp. We go
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35020">
     down to the plains." And as I afterwards learned, they were driven out of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35030">
     mountains a month before the usual time. Were bears much more numerous
    </p>

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35180">
     that ever spread a wing.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35190">
     On the way back to our Tuolumne camp, I enjoyed the scenery if possible more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35200">
     than when it first came to view. Every feature already seems familiar as if I had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35210">
     lived here always. I never weary gazing at the wonderful Cathedral. It has more
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35220">
     individual character than any other rock or mountain I ever saw, excepting
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35230">
     perhaps the Yosemite South Dome. The forests, too, seem kindly familiar, and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35240">
     the lakes and meadows and glad singing streams. I should like to dwell with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35250">
     them forever. Here with bread and water I should be content. Even if not
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35260">
     allowed to roam and climb, tethered to a stake or tree in some meadow or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35270">
     grove, even then I should be con tent forever. Bathed in such beauty, watching,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35280">
     the expressions ever varying on the faces of the mountains, watching the stars,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35290">
     which here have a glory that the lowlander never dreams of, watching the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35300">
     circling seasons, listening to the songs of the waters and winds and birds,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35310">
     would be endless pleasure. And what glorious cloudlands I should see, storms
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35320">
     and calms,—a new heaven and a new earth every day, aye and new

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35330">
     inhabitants. And how many visitors I should have. I feel sure I should not have

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35340">
     one dull moment. And why should this appear extravagant? It is only common
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35350">

     endless Godful play, and what speeches and music and acting and scenery and

     one of those remarkable California men who have been overflowed and
    </p>

     denuded and remodeled by the excitements of the gold fields, like the Sierra

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35500">
     I ought to go through Bloody Cañon, for he was sure I should find it wild
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35510">
     enough. He had not been there himself, he said, but had heard many of his
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35520">
     mining friends speak of it as the wildest of all the Sierra passes. Of course I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35530">
     was glad to go. It lies just to the east of our camp and swoops down from the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35540">
     summit of the range to the edge of the Mono Desert, making a descent of about
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35550">
     four thousand feet in a distance of about four miles. It was known and traveled
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35560">
     as a pass by wild animals and the Indians long before its discovery by white

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35590">
     metamorphic slates in which the cañon abounds, or by the blood stains on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35600">
     rocks from the unfortunate animals that were compelled to slide and shuffle
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35610">
     over the sharp-angled boulders.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35620">
     Early in the morning I tied my notebook and some bread to my belt, and strode
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35630">
     away full of eager hope, feeling that I was going to have a glorious revel. The
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35640">
     glacier meadows that lay along my way served to soothe my morning speed, for
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35650">
     the sod was full of blue gentians and daisies, kalmia and dwarf vaccinium,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35660">
     calling for recognition as old friends, and I had to stop many times to examine
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35670">
     the shining rocks over which the ancient glacier had passed with tremendous
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35680">
     pressure, polishing them so well that they reflected the sunlight like glass in
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35690">
     some places, while fine striæ, seen clearly through a lens, indicated the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35700">
     direction in which the ice had flowed. On some of the sloping polished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35710">
     pavements abrupt steps occur, showing that occasionally large masses of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35720">
     rock had given way before the glacial pressure, as well as small particles;
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35730">
     moraines, too, some scattered, others regular like long curving embankments
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35740">
     and dams, occur here and there, giving the general surface of the region a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35750">
     young, new-made appearance. I watched the gradual dwarfing of the pines as I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35760">
     ascended, and the corresponding dwarfing of nearly all the rest of the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35770">
     vegetation. On the slopes of Mammoth Mountain, to the south of the pass, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35780">
     saw many gaps in the woods reaching from the upper edge of the timber-line
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35790">
     down to the level meadows, where avalanches of snow had descended,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35800">
     sweeping away every tree in their paths as well as the soil they were growing in,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35810">
     leaving the bedrock bare. The trees are nearly all uprooted, but a few that had
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35820">
     been extremely well anchored in clefts of the rock were broken off near the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35830">
     ground. It seems strange at first sight that trees that had been allowed to grow
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35840">
     for a century or more undisturbed should in their old age be thus swished
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35850">
     away at a stroke. Such avalanches can only occur under rare conditions of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35860">
     weather and snowfall. No doubt on some positions of the mountain slopes the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35870">
     inclination and smoothness of the surface is such that avalanches must occur
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35880">
     every winter, or even after every heavy snowstorm, and of course no trees or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35890">
     even bushes can grow in their channels. I noticed a few clean-swept slopes of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35900">
     this kind. The uprooted trees that had grown in the pathway of what might be
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35910">
     called "century avalanches" were piled in windrows, and tucked snugly against
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35920">
     the wall-trees of the gaps, heads downward, excepting a few that were carried
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35930">
     out into the open ground of the meadows, where the heads of the avalanches
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35940">
     had stopped. Young pines, mostly the two-leaved and the white-barked, are
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35950">
     already springing up in these cleared gaps. It would be interesting to ascertain
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35960">
     the age of these saplings, for thus we should gain a fair approximation to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35970">
     year that the great avalanches occurred. Perhaps most or all of them occurred
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35980">
     the same winter. How glad I should be if free to pursue such studies!
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_35990">
     Near the summit at the head of the pass I found a species of dwarf willow lying
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36000">
     perfectly flat on the ground, making a nice, soft, silky gray carpet, not a single
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36010">
     stem or branch more than three inches high; but the catkins, which are now
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36020">
     nearly ripe, stand erect and make a close, nearly regular gray growth, being
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36030">
     larger than all the rest of the plants. Some of these interesting dwarfs have only
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36040">
     one catkin —willow bushes reduced to their lowest terms. I found patches of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36050">
     dwarf vaccinium also forming smooth carpets, closely pressed to the ground or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36060">
     against the sides of stones, and covered with round pink flowers in lavish
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36070">
     abundance as if they had fallen from the sky like hail. A little higher, almost at
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36080">
     the very head of the pass, I found the blue arctic daisy and purple-flowered
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36090">
     bryanthus, the mountain's own darlings, gentle mountaineers face to face with
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36100">
     the sky, kept safe and warm by a thousand miracles, seeming always the finer
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36110">
     and purer the wilder and stormier their homes. The trees, tough and resiny,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36120">
     seem unable to go a step farther; but up and up, far above the tree-line, these
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36130">
     tender plants climb, cheerily spreading their gray and pink carpets right up to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36140">
     the very edges of the snow-banks in deep hollows and shadows. Here, too, is
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36150">
     the familiar robin, tripping on the flowery lawns, bravely singing the same
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36160">
     cheery song I first heard when a boy in Wisconsin newly arrived from old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36170">
     Scotland. In this fine company sauntering enchanted, taking no heed of time, I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36180">
     at length entered the gate of the pass, and the huge rocks began to close
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36190">
     around me in all their mysterious impressiveness. Just then I was startled by a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36200">
     lot of queer, hairy, muffled creatures coming shuffling, shambling, wallow ing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36210">
     toward me as if they had no bones in their bodies. Had I discovered them while
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36220">
     they were yet a good way off, I should have tried to avoid them. What a picture
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36230">
     they made contrasted with the others I had just been admiring. When I came
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36240">
     up to them, I found that they were only a band of Indians from Mono on their
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36250">
     way to Yosemite for a load of acorns. They were wrapped in blankets made of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36260">
     the skins of sage-rabbits. The dirt on some of the faces seemed almost old
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36270">
     enough and thick enough to have a geological significance; some were strangely
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36280">
     blurred and divided into sections by seams and wrinkles that looked like
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36290">
     cleavage joints, and had a worn abraded look as if they had lain exposed to the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36300">
     weather for ages. I tried to pass them without stopping, but they wouldn't let
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36310">
     me; forming a dismal circle about me, I was closely besieged while they begged
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36320">
     whiskey or tobacco, and it was hard to convince them that I hadn't any. How
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36330">
     glad I was to get away from the gray, grim crowd and see them vanish down the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36340">
     trail! Yet it seems sad to feel such desperate repulsion from one's fellow beings,
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36350">
     however degraded. To prefer the society of squirrels and woodchucks to that of
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36360">
     our own species must surely be unnatural. So with a fresh breeze and a hill or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36370">
     mountain between us I must wish them Godspeed and try to pray and sing
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36380">
     with Burns, "It's coming yet, for a' that, that man to man, the warld o'er, shall
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36390">
     brothers be for a' that."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36400">
     How the day passed I hardly know. By the map I have come only about ten or
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36410">
     twelve miles, though the sun is already low in the west, showing how long I
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36420">
     must have lingered, observing, sketching, taking notes among the glaciated
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36430">
     rocks and moraines and Alpine flower-beds.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36440">
     At sundown the somber crags and peaks were inspired with the ineffable
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36450">
     beauty of the alpenglow, and a solemn, awful stillness hushed everything in the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36460">
     landscape. Then I crept into a hollow by the side of a small lake near the head
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36470">
     of the cañon, smoothed a sheltered spot, and gathered a few pine tassels for a
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36480">
     bed. After the short twilight began to fade I kindled a sunny fire, made a tin
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36490">
     cupful of tea, and lay down to watch the stars. Soon the night-wind began to
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36500">
     flow from the snowy peaks overhead, at first only a gentle breathing, then
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36510">
     gaining strength, in less than an hour rumbled in massive volume something
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36520">
     like a boisterous stream in a boulder-choked channel, roaring and moaning
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36530">
     down the cañon as if the work it had to do was tremendously important and
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36540">
     fateful; and mingled with these storm tones were those of the waterfalls on the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36550">
     north side of the cañon, now sounding distinctly, now smothered by the
    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36560">

     the cañon wall, her face apparently filled with eager concern, which had a
    </p>

     gaze on me alone, like a person entering one's bedroom. It was hard to realize

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36740">

    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36770">

    </p>
    <p xml:id="eco_en_000068_36780">
     marvelously impressive and made me forget the Indians, the great black rocks

     the tremendous walls of red slates savagely hacked and scarred and apparently

     to buck and run like a grown deer, jumping high above the fallen trunks, and
    </p>

     was soon out of sight. Possibly its mother may have called it, but I did not hear
