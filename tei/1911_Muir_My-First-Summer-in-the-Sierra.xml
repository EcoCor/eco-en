    <p>
     THROUGH THE FOOTHILLS WITH A FLOCK OF SHEEP
    </p>
    <p>
     In the great Central Valley of California there are only two seasons—spring and
    </p>
    <p>
     summer. The spring begins with the first rainstorm, which usually falls in
    </p>
    <p>
     November. In a few months the wonderful flowery vegetation is in full bloom,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by the end of May it is dead and dry and crisp, as if every plant had been
    </p>
    <p>
     roasted in an oven.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the lolling, panting flocks and herds are driven to the high, cool, green
    </p>
    <p>
     pastures of the Sierra. I was longing for the mountains about this time, but
    </p>
    <p>
     money was scarce and I couldn't see how a bread supply was to be kept up.
    </p>
    <p>
     While I was anxiously brooding on the bread problem, so troublesome to
    </p>
    <p>
     wanderers, and trying to believe that I might learn to live like the wild animals,
    </p>
    <p>
     gleaning nourishment here and there from seeds, berries, etc., sauntering and
    </p>
    <p>
     climbing in joyful independence of money or baggage, Mr. Delaney, a sheepowner, for whom I had worked a few weeks, called on me, and offered to engage
    </p>
    <p>
     me to go with his shepherd and flock to the headwaters of the Merced and
    </p>
    <p>
     Tuolumne rivers—the very region I had most in mind. I was in the mood to
    </p>
    <p>
     accept work of any kind that would take me into the mountains whose
    </p>
    <p>
     treasures I had tasted last summer in the Yosemite region. The flock, he
    </p>
    <p>
     explained, would be moved gradually higher through the successive forest belts
    </p>
    <p>
     as the snow melted, stopping for a few weeks at the best places we came to.
    </p>
    <p>
     These I thought would be good centers of observation from which I might be
    </p>
    <p>
     able to make many telling excursions within a radius of eight or ten miles of
    </p>
    <p>
     the camps to learn something of the plants, animals, and rocks; for he assured
    </p>
    <p>
     me that I should be left perfectly free to follow my studies. I judged, however,
    </p>
    <p>
     that I was in no way the right man for the place, and freely explained my
    </p>
    <p>
     shortcomings, confessing that I was wholly unacquainted with the topography
    </p>
    <p>
     of the upper mountains, the streams that would have to be crossed, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     wild sheep-eating animals, etc.; in short that, what with bears, coyotes, rivers,
    </p>
    <p>
     cañons, and thorny, bewildering chaparral, I feared that half or more of his
    </p>
    <p>
     flock would be lost. Fortunately these shortcom ings seemed insignificant to
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Delaney. The main thing, he said, was to have a man about the camp
    </p>
    <p>
     whom he could trust to see that the shepherd did his duty, and he assured me
    </p>
    <p>
     that the difficulties that seemed so formidable at a distance would vanish as we
    </p>
    <p>
     went on; encouraging me further by saying that the shepherd would do all the
    </p>
    <p>
     herding, that I could study plants and rocks and scenery as much as I liked,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that he would himself accompany us to the first main camp and make
    </p>
    <p>
     occasional visits to our higher ones to replenish our store of provisions and see
    </p>
    <p>
     how we prospered. Therefore I concluded to go, though still fearing, when I saw
    </p>
    <p>
     the silly sheep bouncing one by one through the narrow gate of the home corral
    </p>
    <p>
     to be counted, that of the two thousand and fifty many would never return.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was fortunate in getting a fine St. Bernard dog for a companion. His master, a
    </p>
    <p>
     hunter with whom I was slightly acquainted, came to me as soon as he heard
    </p>
    <p>
     that I was going to spend the summer in the Sierra and begged me to take his
    </p>
    <p>
     favorite dog, Carlo, with me, for he feared that if he were compelled to stay all
    </p>
    <p>
     summer on the plains the fierce heat might be the death of him. "I think I can
    </p>
    <p>
     trust you to be kind to him," he said, "and I am sure he will be good to you. He
    </p>
    <p>
     knows all about the moun tain animals, will guard the camp, assist in
    </p>
    <p>
     managing the sheep, and in every way be found able and faithful." Carlo knew
    </p>
    <p>
     we were talking about him, watched our faces, and listened so attentively that I
    </p>
    <p>
     fancied he understood us. Calling him by name, I asked him if he was willing to
    </p>
    <p>
     go with me. He looked me in the face with eyes expressing wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence, then turned to his master, and after permission was given by a
    </p>
    <p>
     wave of the hand toward me and a farewell patting caress, he quietly followed
    </p>
    <p>
     me as if he perfectly understood all that had been said and had known me
    </p>
    <p>
     always.
    </p>
    <p>
     June , . This morning provisions, camp-kettles, blankets, plant-press, etc.,
    </p>
    <p>
     were packed on two horses, the flock headed for the tawny foothills, and away
    </p>
    <p>
     we sauntered in a cloud of dust: Mr. Delaney, bony and tall, with sharply
    </p>
    <p>
     hacked profile like Don Quixote, leading the pack-horses, Billy, the proud
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherd, a Chinaman and a Digger Indian to assist in driving for the first few
    </p>
    <p>
     days in the brushy foothills, and myself with notebook tied to my belt.
    </p>
    <p>
     The home ranch from which we set out is on the south side of the Tuolumne
    </p>
    <p>
     River near French Bar, where the foothills of metamorphic gold-bearing slates
    </p>
    <p>
     dip below the stratified deposits of the Central Valley. We had not gone more
    </p>
    <p>
     than a mile before some of the old leaders of the flock showed by the eager,
    </p>
    <p>
     inquiring way they ran and looked ahead that they were thinking of the high
    </p>
    <p>
     pastures they had enjoyed last summer. Soon the whole flock seemed to be
    </p>
    <p>
     hopefully excited, the mothers calling their lambs, the lambs replying in tones
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderfully human, their fondly quavering calls interrupted now and then by
    </p>
    <p>
     hastily snatched mouthfuls of withered grass. Amid all this seeming babel of
    </p>
    <p>
     baas as they streamed over the hills every mother and child recognized each
    </p>
    <p>
     other's voice. In case a tired lamb, half asleep in the smothering dust, should
    </p>
    <p>
     fail to answer, its mother would come running back through the flock toward
    </p>
    <p>
     the spot whence its last response was heard, and refused to be comforted until
    </p>
    <p>
     she found it, the one of a thousand, though to our eyes and ears all seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     alike.
    </p>
    <p>
     The flock traveled at the rate of about a mile an hour, outspread in the form of
    </p>
    <p>
     an irregular triangle, about a hundred yards wide at the base, and a hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     and fifty yards long, with a crooked, ever-changing point made up of the
    </p>
    <p>
     strongest foragers, called the "leaders," which, with the most active of those
    </p>
    <p>
     scattered along the ragged sides of the "main body," hastily explored nooks in
    </p>
    <p>
     the rocks and bushes for grass and leaves; the lambs and feeble old mothers
    </p>
    <p>
     dawdling in the rear were called the "tail end."
    </p>
    <p>
     Sheep in the Mountains
    </p>
    <p>
     About noon the heat was hard to bear; the poor sheep panted pitifully and tried
    </p>
    <p>
     to stop in the shade of every tree they came to, while we gazed with eager
    </p>
    <p>
     longing through the dim burning glare toward the snowy mountains and
    </p>
    <p>
     streams, though not one was in sight. The landscape is only wavering foothills
    </p>
    <p>
     roughened here and there with bushes and trees and outcropping masses of
    </p>
    <p>
     slate. The trees, mostly the blue oak Quercus Douglasii, are about thirty to
    </p>
    <p>
     forty feet high, with pale blue-green leaves and white bark, sparsely planted on
    </p>
    <p>
     the thinnest soil or in crevices of rocks beyond the reach of grass fires. The
    </p>
    <p>
     slates in many places rise abruptly through the tawny grass in sharp lichencovered slabs like tombstones in deserted burying-grounds. With the exception
    </p>
    <p>
     of the oak and four or five species of manzanita and ceanothus, the vegetation
    </p>
    <p>
     of the foothills is mostly the same as that of the plains. I saw this region in the
    </p>
    <p>
     early spring, when it was a charming landscape garden full of birds and bees
    </p>
    <p>
     and flowers. Now the scorching weather makes everything dreary. The ground
    </p>
    <p>
     is full of cracks, lizards glide about on the rocks, and ants in amazing
    </p>
    <p>
     numbers, whose tiny sparks of life only burn the brighter with the heat, fairly
    </p>
    <p>
     quiver with unquenchable energy as they run in long lines to fight and gather
    </p>
    <p>
     food. How it comes that they do not dry to a crisp in a few seconds' exposure to
    </p>
    <p>
     such sun-fire is marvelous. A few rattlesnakes lie coiled in out-of-the-way
    </p>
    <p>
     places, but are seldom seen. Magpies and crows, usually so noisy, are silent
    </p>
    <p>
     now, standing in mixed flocks on the ground beneath the best shade trees,
    </p>
    <p>
     with bills wide open and wings drooped, too breathless to speak; the quails also
    </p>
    <p>
     are trying to keep in the shade about the few tepid alkaline water-holes;
    </p>
    <p>
     cottontail rabbits are running from shade to shade among the ceanothus
    </p>
    <p>
     brush, and occasionally the long-eared hare is seen cantering gracefully across
    </p>
    <p>
     the wider openings.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a short noon rest in a grove, the poor dust-choked flock was again driven
    </p>
    <p>
     ahead over the brushy hills, but the dim roadway we had been following faded
    </p>
    <p>
     away just where it was most needed, compelling us to stop to look about us
    </p>
    <p>
     and get our bearings. The Chinaman seemed to think we were lost, and
    </p>
    <p>
     chattered in pidgin English concerning the abundance of "litty stick" chaparral,
    </p>
    <p>
     while the Indian silently scanned the billowy ridges and gulches for openings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pushing through the thorny jungle, we at length discovered a road trending
    </p>
    <p>
     toward Coulterville, which we followed until an hour before sunset, when we
    </p>
    <p>
     reached a dry ranch and camped for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Camping in the foothills with a flock of sheep is simple and easy, but far from
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasant. The sheep were allowed to pick what they could find in the
    </p>
    <p>
     neighborhood until after sunset, watched by the shepherd, while the others
    </p>
    <p>
     gathered wood, made a fire, cooked, unpacked and fed the horses, etc. About
    </p>
    <p>
     dusk the weary sheep were gathered on the highest open spot near camp,
    </p>
    <p>
     where they willingly bunched close together, and after each mother had found
    </p>
    <p>
     her lamb and suckled it, all lay down and required no attention until morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Supper was announced by the call, "Grub!" Each with a tin plate helped
    </p>
    <p>
     himself direct from the pots and pans while chatting about such camp studies
    </p>
    <p>
     as sheep-feed, mines, coyotes, bears, or adventures during the memorable gold
    </p>
    <p>
     days of pay dirt. The Indian kept in the background, saying never a word, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     he belonged to another species. The meal finished, the dogs were fed, the
    </p>
    <p>
     smokers smoked by the fire, and under the influences of fullness and tobacco
    </p>
    <p>
     the calm that settled on their faces seemed almost divine, something like the
    </p>
    <p>
     mellow meditative glow portrayed on the countenances of saints. Then
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly, as if awakening from a dream, each with a sigh or a grunt knocked
    </p>
    <p>
     the ashes out of his pipe, yawned, gazed at the fire a few moments, said, "Well,
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe I'll turn in," and straightway vanished beneath his blankets. The fire
    </p>
    <p>
     smouldered and flickered an hour or two longer; the stars shone brighter;
    </p>
    <p>
     coons, coyotes, and owls stirred the silence here and there, while crickets and
    </p>
    <p>
     hylas made a cheerful, continuous music, so fitting and full that it seemed a
    </p>
    <p>
     part of the very body of the night. The only discordance came from a snoring
    </p>
    <p>
     sleeper, and the coughing sheep with dust in their throats. In the starlight the
    </p>
    <p>
     flock looked like a big gray blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . The camp was astir at daybreak; coffee, bacon, and beans formed the
    </p>
    <p>
     breakfast, followed by quick dish-washing and packing. A general bleating
    </p>
    <p>
     began about sunrise. As soon as a mother ewe arose, her lamb came bounding
    </p>
    <p>
     and bunting for its breakfast, and after the thousand youngsters had been
    </p>
    <p>
     suckled the flock began to nibble and spread. The restless wethers with
    </p>
    <p>
     ravenous appetites were the first to move, but dared not go far from the main
    </p>
    <p>
     body. Billy and the Indian and the Chinaman kept them headed along the
    </p>
    <p>
     weary road, and allowed them to pick up what little they could find on a
    </p>
    <p>
     breadth of about a quarter of a mile. But as several flocks had already gone
    </p>
    <p>
     ahead of us, scarce a leaf, green or dry, was left; therefore the starving flock
    </p>
    <p>
     had to be hurried on over the bare, hot hills to the nearest of the green
    </p>
    <p>
     pastures, about twenty or thirty miles from here.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pack-animals were led by Don Quixote, a heavy rifle over his shoulder
    </p>
    <p>
     intended for bears and wolves. This day has been as hot and dusty as the first,
    </p>
    <p>
     leading over gently sloping brown hills, with mostly the same vegetation,
    </p>
    <p>
     excepting the strange-looking Sabine pine Pinus Sabiniana, which here forms
    </p>
    <p>
     small groves or is scattered among the blue oaks. The trunk divides at a height
    </p>
    <p>
     of fifteen or twenty feet into two or more stems, outleaning or nearly upright,
    </p>
    <p>
     with many straggling branches and long gray needles, casting but little shade.
    </p>
    <p>
     In general appearance this tree looks more like a palm than a pine. The cones
    </p>
    <p>
     are about six or seven inches long, about five in diameter, very heavy, and last
    </p>
    <p>
     long after they fall, so that the ground beneath the trees is covered with them.
    </p>
    <p>
     They make fine resiny, light-giving camp-fires, next to ears of Indian corn the
    </p>
    <p>
     most beautiful fuel I've ever seen. The nuts, the Don tells me, are gathered in
    </p>
    <p>
     large quantities by the Digger Indians for food. They are about as large and
    </p>
    <p>
     hard-shelled as hazelnuts—food and fire fit for the gods from the same fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . This morning a few hours after setting out with the crawling sheepcloud, we gained the summit of the first well-defined bench on the mountainflank at Pino Blanco. The Sabine pines interest me greatly. They are so airy and
    </p>
    <p>
     strangely palm-like I was eager to sketch them, and was in a fever of
    </p>
    <p>
     excitement without accomplishing much. I managed to halt long enough,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, to make a tolerably fair sketch of Pino Blanco peak from the
    </p>
    <p>
     southwest side, where there is a small field and vineyard irrigated by a stream
    </p>
    <p>
     that makes a pretty fall on its way down a gorge by the roadside.
    </p>
    <p>
     After gaining the open summit of this first bench, feeling the natural
    </p>
    <p>
     exhilaration due to the slight elevation of a thousand feet or so, and the hopes
    </p>
    <p>
     excited concerning the outlook to be obtained, a magnificent section of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Merced Valley at what is called Horseshoe Bend came full in sight—a glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     wilderness that seemed to be calling with a thousand songful voices. Bold,
    </p>
    <p>
     down-sweeping slopes, feathered with pines and clumps of manzanita with
    </p>
    <p>
     sunny, open spaces between them, make up most of the foreground; the middle
    </p>
    <p>
     and background present fold beyond fold of finely modeled hills and ridges
    </p>
    <p>
     rising into mountain-like masses in the dis tance, all covered with a shaggy
    </p>
    <p>
     growth of chaparral, mostly adenostoma, planted so marvelously close and
    </p>
    <p>
     even that it looks like soft, rich plush without a single tree or bare spot. As far
    </p>
    <p>
     as the eye can reach it extends, a heaving, swelling sea of green as regular and
    </p>
    <p>
     continuous as that produced by the heaths of Scotland. The sculpture of the
    </p>
    <p>
     landscape is as striking in its main lines as in its lavish richness of detail; a
    </p>
    <p>
     grand congregation of massive heights with the river shining between, each
    </p>
    <p>
     carved into smooth, graceful folds without leaving a single rocky angle exposed,
    </p>
    <p>
     as if the delicate fluting and ridging fashioned out of metamorphic slates had
    </p>
    <p>
     been carefully sandpapered. The whole landscape showed design, like man's
    </p>
    <p>
     noblest sculptures. How wonderful the power of its beauty! Gazing awestricken, I might have left everything for it. Glad, endless work would then be
    </p>
    <p>
     mine tracing the forces that have brought forth its features, its rocks and
    </p>
    <p>
     plants and animals and glorious weather. Beauty beyond thought everywhere,
    </p>
    <p>
     beneath, above, made and being made forever. I gazed and gazed and longed
    </p>
    <p>
     and admired until the dusty sheep and packs were far out of sight, made
    </p>
    <p>
     hurried notes and a sketch, though there was no need of either, for the colors
    </p>
    <p>
     and lines and expression of this di vine landscape-countenance are so burned
    </p>
    <p>
     into mind and heart they surely can never grow dim.
    </p>
    <p>
     ON SECOND BENCH. EDGE OF THE MAIN FOREST BELT ABOVE
    </p>
    <p>
     COULTERVILLE, NEAR GREELEY'S MILL
    </p>
    <p>
     The evening of this charmed day is cool, calm, cloudless, and full of a kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     lightning I have never seen before—white glowing cloud-shaped masses down
    </p>
    <p>
     among the trees and bushes, like quick-throbbing fireflies in the Wisconsin
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows rather than the so-called "wild fire." The spreading hairs of the
    </p>
    <p>
     horses' tails and sparks from our blankets show how highly charged the air is.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . We are now on what may be called the second bench or plateau of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Range, after making many small ups and downs over belts of hill-waves, with,
    </p>
    <p>
     of course, corresponding changes in the vegetation. In open spots many of the
    </p>
    <p>
     lowland compositæ are still to be found, and some of the Mariposa tulips and
    </p>
    <p>
     other conspicuous members of the lily family; but the characteristic blue oak of
    </p>
    <p>
     the foothills is left below, and its place is taken by a fine large species Quercus
    </p>
    <p>
     Californica with deeply lobed deciduous leaves, picturesquely divided trunk,
    </p>
    <p>
     and broad, massy, finely lobed and modeled head. Here also at a height of
    </p>
    <p>
     about twenty-five hundred feet we come to the edge of the great coniferous
    </p>
    <p>
     forest, made up mostly of yellow pine with just a few sugar pines. We are now
    </p>
    <p>
     in the mountains and they are in us, kindling enthusiasm, making every nerve
    </p>
    <p>
     quiver, filling every pore and cell of us. Our flesh-and-bone tabernacle seems
    </p>
    <p>
     transparent as glass to the beauty about us, as if truly an inseparable part of
    </p>
    <p>
     it, thrilling with the air and trees, streams and rocks, in the waves of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sun,—a part of all nature, neither old nor young, sick nor well, but immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just now I can hardly conceive of any bodily condition dependent on food or
    </p>
    <p>
     breath any more than the ground or the sky. How glorious a conversion, so
    </p>
    <p>
     complete and wholesome it is, scarce memory enough of old bondage days left
    </p>
    <p>
     as a standpoint to view it from! In this newness of life we seem to have been so
    </p>
    <p>
     always.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through a meadow opening in the pine woods I see snowy peaks about the
    </p>
    <p>
     headwaters of the Merced above Yosemite. How near they seem and how clear
    </p>
    <p>
     their outlines on the blue air, or rather in the blue air; for they seem to be
    </p>
    <p>
     saturated with it. How consuming strong the invitation they extend! Shall I be
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed to go to them? Night and day I'll pray that I may, but it seems too good
    </p>
    <p>
     to be true. Some one worthy will go, able for the Godful work, yet as far as I
    </p>
    <p>
     can I must drift about these love-monument mountains, glad to be a servant of
    </p>
    <p>
     servants in so holy a wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Found a lovely lily Calochortus albus in a shady adenostoma thicket near
    </p>
    <p>
     Coulterville, in company with Adiantum Chilense. It is white with a faint
    </p>
    <p>
     purplish tinge inside at the base of the petals, a most impressive plant, pure as
    </p>
    <p>
     a snow crystal, one of the plant saints that all must love and be made so much
    </p>
    <p>
     the purer by it every time it is seen. It puts the roughest mountaineer on his
    </p>
    <p>
     good behavior. With this plant the whole world would seem rich though none
    </p>
    <p>
     other existed. It is not easy to keep on with the camp cloud while such plant
    </p>
    <p>
     people are standing preaching by the wayside.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the afternoon we passed a fine meadow bounded by stately pines,
    </p>
    <p>
     mostly the arrowy yellow pine, with here and there a noble sugar pine, its
    </p>
    <p>
     feathery arms outspread above the spires of its companion species in marked
    </p>
    <p>
     contrast; a glorious tree, its cones fifteen to twenty inches long, swinging like
    </p>
    <p>
     tassels at the ends of the branches with superb ornamental effect. Saw some
    </p>
    <p>
     logs of this species at the Greeley Mill. They are round and regular as if turned
    </p>
    <p>
     in a lathe, excepting the butt cuts, which have a few buttressing projections.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fragrance of the sugary sap is delicious and scents the mill and lumber
    </p>
    <p>
     yard. How beautiful the ground be neath this pine thickly strewn with slender
    </p>
    <p>
     needles and grand cones, and the piles of cone-scales, seed-wings and shells
    </p>
    <p>
     around the instep of each tree where the squirrels have been feasting! They get
    </p>
    <p>
     the seeds by cutting off the scales at the base in regular order, following their
    </p>
    <p>
     spiral arrangement, and the two seeds at the base of each scale, a hundred or
    </p>
    <p>
     two in a cone, must make a good meal. The yellow pine cones and those of
    </p>
    <p>
     most other species and genera are held upside down on the ground by the
    </p>
    <p>
     Douglas squirrel, and turned around gradually until stripped, while he sits
    </p>
    <p>
     usually with his back to a tree, probably for safety. Strange to say, he never
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to get himself smeared with gum, not even his paws or whiskers—and
    </p>
    <p>
     how cleanly and beautiful in color the cone-litter kitchen-middens he makes.
    </p>
    <p>
     We are now approaching the region of clouds and cool streams. Magnificent
    </p>
    <p>
     white cumuli appeared about noon above the Yosemite region,—floating
    </p>
    <p>
     fountains refreshing the glorious wilderness,—sky mountains in whose pearly
    </p>
    <p>
     hills and dales the streams take their rise,—blessing with cooling shadows and
    </p>
    <p>
     rain. No rock landscape is more varied in sculpture, none more delicately
    </p>
    <p>
     modeled than these landscapes of the sky; domes and peaks rising, swelling,
    </p>
    <p>
     white as finest marble and firmly outlined, a most impressive manifestation of
    </p>
    <p>
     world building. Every rain-cloud, however fleeting, leaves its mark, not only on
    </p>
    <p>
     trees and flowers whose pulses are quickened, and on the replenished streams
    </p>
    <p>
     and lakes, but also on the rocks are its marks engraved whether we can see
    </p>
    <p>
     them or not.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have been examining the curious and influential shrub Adenostoma
    </p>
    <p>
     fasciculata, first noticed about Horseshoe Bend. It is very abundant on the
    </p>
    <p>
     lower slopes of the second plateau near Coulterville, forming a dense, almost
    </p>
    <p>
     impenetrable growth that looks dark in the distance. It belongs to the rose
    </p>
    <p>
     family, is about six or eight feet high, has small white flowers in racemes eight
    </p>
    <p>
     to twelve inches long, round needle-like leaves, and reddish bark that becomes
    </p>
    <p>
     shreddy when old. It grows on sun-beaten slopes, and like grass is often swept
    </p>
    <p>
     away by running fires, but is quickly renewed from the roots. Any trees that
    </p>
    <p>
     may have established themselves in its midst are at length killed by these fires,
    </p>
    <p>
     and this no doubt is the secret of the unbroken character of its broad belts. A
    </p>
    <p>
     few manzanitas, which also rise again from the root after consuming fires,
    </p>
    <p>
     make out to dwell with it, also a few bush compositæ—baccharis and linosyris,
    </p>
    <p>
     and some liliaceous plants, mostly calochortus and brodiæa, with deepset
    </p>
    <p>
     bulbs safe from fire. A multitude of birds and "wee, sleekit, cow'rin', tim'rous
    </p>
    <p>
     beasties" find good homes in its deepest thickets, and the open bays and lanes
    </p>
    <p>
     that fringe the margins of its main belts offer shelter and food to the deer when
    </p>
    <p>
     winter storms drive them down from their high mountain pastures. A most
    </p>
    <p>
     admirable plant! It is now in bloom, and I like to wear its pretty fragrant
    </p>
    <p>
     racemes in my buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Azalea occidentalis, another charming shrub, grows beside cool streams
    </p>
    <p>
     hereabouts and much higher in the Yosemite region. We found it this evening
    </p>
    <p>
     in bloom a few miles above Greeley's Mill, where we are camped for the night. It
    </p>
    <p>
     is closely related to the rhododendrons, is very showy and fragrant, and
    </p>
    <p>
     everybody must like it not only for itself but for the shady alders and willows,
    </p>
    <p>
     ferny meadows, and living water associated with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another conifer was met to-day,—incense cedar Libocedrus decurrens, a large
    </p>
    <p>
     tree with warm yellow-green foliage in flat plumes like those of arborvitæ, bark
    </p>
    <p>
     cinnamon-colored, and as the boles of the old trees are without limbs they
    </p>
    <p>
     make striking pillars in the woods where the sun chances to shine on them—a
    </p>
    <p>
     worthy companion of the kingly sugar and yellow pines. I feel strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     attracted to this tree. The brown close-grained wood, as well as the small scalelike leaves, is fragrant, and the flat overlapping plumes make fine beds, and
    </p>
    <p>
     must shed the rain well. It would be delightful to be storm-bound beneath one
    </p>
    <p>
     of these noble, hospitable, inviting old trees, its broad sheltering arms bent
    </p>
    <p>
     down like a tent, incense rising from the fire made from its dry fallen branches,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a hearty wind chanting overhead. But the weather is calm to-night, and
    </p>
    <p>
     our camp is only a sheep camp. We are near the North Fork of the Merced. The
    </p>
    <p>
     night wind is telling the wonders of the upper mountains, their snow fountains
    </p>
    <p>
     and gardens, forests and groves; even their topography is in its tones. And the
    </p>
    <p>
     stars, the everlasting sky lilies, how bright they are now that we have climbed
    </p>
    <p>
     above the lowland dust! The horizon is bounded and adorned by a spiry wall of
    </p>
    <p>
     pines, every tree harmoniously related to every other; definite symbols, divine
    </p>
    <p>
     hieroglyphics written with sunbeams. Would I could understand them! The
    </p>
    <p>
     stream flowing past the camp through ferns and lilies and alders makes sweet
    </p>
    <p>
     music to the ear, but the pines marshaled around the edge of the sky make a
    </p>
    <p>
     yet sweeter music to the eye. Divine beauty all. Here I could stay tethered
    </p>
    <p>
     forever with just bread and water, nor would I be lonely; loved friends and
    </p>
    <p>
     neighbors, as love for everything increased, would seem all the nearer however
    </p>
    <p>
     many the miles and mountains between us.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . The sheep were sick last night, and many of them are still far from well,
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly able to leave camp, coughing, groaning, looking wretched and pitiful, all
    </p>
    <p>
     from eating the leaves of the blessed azalea. So at least say the shepherd and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Don. Having had but little grass since they left the plains, they are starving,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so eat anything green they can get. "Sheep men" call azalea "sheeppoison," and wonder what the Creator was thinking about when he made it,—
    </p>
    <p>
     so desperately does sheep business blind and degrade, though supposed to
    </p>
    <p>
     have a refining influence in the good old days we read of. The California sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     owner is in haste to get rich, and often does, now that pasturage costs nothing,
    </p>
    <p>
     while the climate is so favorable that no winter food supply, shelter-pens, or
    </p>
    <p>
     barns are required. Therefore large flocks may be kept at slight expense, and
    </p>
    <p>
     large profits realized, the money invested doubling, it is claimed, every other
    </p>
    <p>
     year. This quickly acquired wealth usually creates desire for more. Then indeed
    </p>
    <p>
     the wool is drawn close down over the poor fellow's eyes, dimming or shutting
    </p>
    <p>
     out almost everything worth seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for the shepherd, his case is still worse, especially in winter when he lives
    </p>
    <p>
     alone in a cabin. For, though stimulated at times by hopes of one day owning a
    </p>
    <p>
     flock and getting rich like his boss, he at the same time is likely to be degraded
    </p>
    <p>
     by the life he leads, and seldom reaches the dignity or advantage—or
    </p>
    <p>
     disadvantage—of ownership. The degradation in his case has for cause one not
    </p>
    <p>
     far to seek. He is solitary most of the year, and solitude to most people seems
    </p>
    <p>
     hard to bear. He seldom has much good mental work or recreation in the way
    </p>
    <p>
     of books. Coming into his dingy hovel-cabin at night, stupidly weary, he finds
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing to balance and level his life with the universe. No, after his dull drag all
    </p>
    <p>
     day after the sheep, he must get his supper; he is likely to slight this task and
    </p>
    <p>
     try to satisfy his hunger with whatever comes handy. Perhaps no bread is
    </p>
    <p>
     baked; then he just makes a few grimy flapjacks in his unwashed frying-pan,
    </p>
    <p>
     boils a handful of tea, and perhaps fries a few strips of rusty bacon. Usually
    </p>
    <p>
     there are dried peaches or apples in the cabin, but he hates to be bothered
    </p>
    <p>
     with the cooking of them, just swallows the bacon and flapjacks, and depends
    </p>
    <p>
     on the genial stupefaction of tobacco for the rest. Then to bed, often without
    </p>
    <p>
     removing the clothing worn during the day. Of course his health suffers,
    </p>
    <p>
     reacting on his mind; and seeing nobody for weeks or months, he finally
    </p>
    <p>
     becomes semi-insane or wholly so.
    </p>
    <p>
     The shepherd in Scotland seldom thinks of being anything but a shepherd. He
    </p>
    <p>
     has probably descended from a race of shepherds and inherited a love and
    </p>
    <p>
     aptitude for the business almost as marked as that of his collie. He has but a
    </p>
    <p>
     small flock to look after, sees his family and neighbors, has time for reading in
    </p>
    <p>
     fine weather, and often carries books to the fields with which he may converse
    </p>
    <p>
     with kings. The oriental shepherd, we read, called his sheep by name; they
    </p>
    <p>
     knew his voice and followed him. The flocks must have been small and easily
    </p>
    <p>
     managed, allowing piping on the hills and ample leisure for reading and
    </p>
    <p>
     thinking. But whatever the blessings of sheep-culture in other times and
    </p>
    <p>
     countries, the California shepherd, as far as I've seen or heard, is never quite
    </p>
    <p>
     sane for any considerable time. Of all Nature's voices baa is about all he hears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the howls and ki-yis of coyotes might be blessings if well heard, but he
    </p>
    <p>
     hears them only through a blur of mutton and wool, and they do him no good.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sick sheep are getting well, and the shepherd is discoursing on the various
    </p>
    <p>
     poisons lurking in these high pastures—azalea, kalmia, alkali. After crossing
    </p>
    <p>
     the North Fork of the Merced we turned to the left toward Pilot Peak, and made
    </p>
    <p>
     a considerable ascent on a rocky, brush-covered ridge to Brown's Flat, where
    </p>
    <p>
     for the first time since leaving the plains the flock is enjoying plenty of green
    </p>
    <p>
     grass. Mr. Delaney intends to seek a permanent camp somewhere in the
    </p>
    <p>
     neighborhood, to last several weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before noon we passed Bower Cave, a delightful marble palace, not dark and
    </p>
    <p>
     dripping, but filled with sunshine, which pours into it through its wide-open
    </p>
    <p>
     mouth facing the south. It has a fine, deep, clear little lake with mossy banks
    </p>
    <p>
     embowered with broad-leaved maples, all under ground, wholly unlike
    </p>
    <p>
     anything I have seen in the cave line even in Kentucky, where a large part of
    </p>
    <p>
     the State is honeycombed with caves. This curious specimen of subterranean
    </p>
    <p>
     scenery is located on a belt of marble that is said to extend from the north end
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Range to the extreme south. Many other caves occur on the belt, but
    </p>
    <p>
     none like this, as far as I have learned, combining as it does sunny outdoor
    </p>
    <p>
     brightness and vegetation with the crystalline beauty of the under world. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     claimed by a Frenchman, who has fenced and locked it, placed a boat on the
    </p>
    <p>
     lakelet and seats on the mossy bank under the maple trees, and charges a
    </p>
    <p>
     dollar admission fee. Being on one of the ways to the Yosemite Valley, a good
    </p>
    <p>
     many tourists visit it during the travel months of summer, regarding it as an
    </p>
    <p>
     interesting addition to their Yosemite wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Poison oak or poison ivy Rhus diversiloba, both as a bush and a scrambler up
    </p>
    <p>
     trees and rocks, is common throughout the foothill region up to a height of at
    </p>
    <p>
     least three thousand feet above the sea. It is somewhat troublesome to most
    </p>
    <p>
     travelers, inflaming the skin and eyes, but blends harmoniously with its
    </p>
    <p>
     companion plants, and many a charming flower leans confidingly upon it for
    </p>
    <p>
     protection and shade. I have oftentimes found the curious twining lily
    </p>
    <p>
     Stropholirion Californicum climbing its branches, showing no fear but rather
    </p>
    <p>
     congenial companionship. Sheep eat it without apparent ill effects; so do
    </p>
    <p>
     horses to some extent, though not fond of it, and to many persons it is
    </p>
    <p>
     harmless. Like most other things not apparently useful to man, it has few
    </p>
    <p>
     friends, and the blind question, "Why was it made?" goes on and on with never
    </p>
    <p>
     a guess that first of all it might have been made for itself.

    <p>
     Brown's Flat is a shallow fertile valley on the top of the divide between the
    </p>
    <p>
     North Fork of the Merced and Bull Creek, commanding magnificent views in
    </p>
    <p>
     every direction. Here the adventurous pioneer David Brown made his
    </p>
    <p>
     headquarters for many years, dividing his time between gold-hunting and bearhunting. Where could lonely hunter find a better solitude? Game in the woods,
    </p>
    <p>
     gold in the rocks, health and exhilaration in the air, while the colors and cloud
    </p>
    <p>
     furniture of the sky are ever inspiring through all sorts of weather. Though
    </p>
    <p>
     sternly practical, like most pioneers, old David seems to have been
    </p>
    <p>
     uncommonly fond of scenery. Mr. Delaney, who knew him well, tells me that he
    </p>
    <p>
     dearly loved to climb to the summit of a commanding ridge to gaze abroad over
    </p>
    <p>
     the forest to the snow-clad peaks and sources of the rivers, and over the
    </p>
    <p>
     foreground valleys and gulches to note where miners were at work or claims
    </p>
    <p>
     were abandoned, judging by smoke from cabins and camp-fires, the sounds of
    </p>
    <p>
     axes, etc.; and when a rifle-shot was heard, to guess who was the hunter,
    </p>
    <p>
     whether Indian or some poacher on his wide domain. His dog Sandy
    </p>
    <p>
     accompanied him everywhere, and well the little hairy mountaineer knew and
    </p>
    <p>
     loved his master and his master's aims. In deer-hunting he had but little to do,
    </p>
    <p>
     trot ting behind his master as he slowly made his way through the wood,
    </p>
    <p>
     careful not to step heavily on dry twigs, scanning open spots in the chaparral,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the game loves to feed in the early morning and towards sunset; peering
    </p>
    <p>
     cautiously over ridges as new outlooks were reached, and along the meadowy
    </p>
    <p>
     borders of streams. But when bears were hunted, little Sandy became more
    </p>
    <p>
     important, and it was as a bear-hunter that Brown became famous. His
    </p>
    <p>
     hunting method, as described by Mr. Delaney, who had passed many a night
    </p>
    <p>
     with him in his lonely cabin and learned his stories, was simply to go slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     and silently through the best bear pastures, with his dog and rifle and a few
    </p>
    <p>
     pounds of flour, until he found a fresh track and then follow it to the death,
    </p>
    <p>
     paying no heed to the time required. Wherever the bear went he followed, led
    </p>
    <p>
     by little Sandy, who had a keen nose and never lost the track, however rocky
    </p>
    <p>
     the ground. When high open points were reached, the likeliest places were
    </p>
    <p>
     carefully scanned. The time of year enabled the hunter to determine
    </p>
    <p>
     approximately where the bear would be found,—in the spring and early
    </p>
    <p>
     summer on open spots about the banks of streams and springy places eating
    </p>
    <p>
     grass and clover and lupines, or in dry meadows feasting on strawberries;
    </p>
    <p>
     toward the end of summer, on dry ridges, feasting on manzanita berries,
    </p>
    <p>
     sitting on his haunches, pulling down the laden branches with his paws, and
    </p>
    <p>
     pressing them together so as to get good compact mouthfuls however much
    </p>
    <p>
     mixed with twigs and leaves; in the Indian summer, beneath the pines,
    </p>
    <p>
     chewing the cones cut off by the squirrels, or occasionally climbing a tree to
    </p>
    <p>
     gnaw and break off the fruitful branches. In late autumn, when acorns are
    </p>
    <p>
     ripe, Bruin's favorite feeding-grounds are groves of the California oak in parklike cañon flats. Always the cunning hunter knew where to look, and seldom
    </p>
    <p>
     came upon Bruin unawares. When the hot scent showed the dangerous game
    </p>
    <p>
     was nigh, a long halt was made, and the intricacies of the topography and
    </p>
    <p>
     vegetation leisurely scanned to catch a glimpse of the shaggy wanderer, or to at
    </p>
    <p>
     least determine where he was most likely to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Whenever," said the hunter, "I saw a bear before it saw me I had no trouble in
    </p>
    <p>
     killing it. I just studied the lay of the land and got to leeward of it no matter
    </p>
    <p>
     how far around I had to go, and then worked up to within a few hundred yards
    </p>
    <p>
     or so, at the foot of a tree that I could easily climb, but too small for the bear to
    </p>
    <p>
     climb. Then I looked well to the condition of my rifle, took off my boots so as to
    </p>
    <p>
     climb well if necessary, and waited until the bear turned its side in clear view
    </p>
    <p>
     when I could make a sure or at least a good shot. In case it showed fight I
    </p>
    <p>
     climbed out of reach. But bears are slow and awkward with their eyes, and
    </p>
    <p>
     being to leeward of them they could not scent me, and I often got in a second
    </p>
    <p>
     shot before they noticed the smoke. Usually, however, they run when wounded
    </p>
    <p>
     and hide in the brush. I let them run a good safe time before I ventured to
    </p>
    <p>
     follow them, and Sandy was pretty sure to find them dead. If not, he barked
    </p>
    <p>
     and drew their attention, and occasionally rushed in for a distracting bite, so
    </p>
    <p>
     that I was able to get to a safe distance for a final shot. Oh yes, bear-hunting is
    </p>
    <p>
     safe enough when followed in a safe way, though like every other business it
    </p>
    <p>
     has its accidents, and little doggie and I have had some close calls. Bears like
    </p>
    <p>
     to keep out of the way of men as a general thing, but if an old, lean, hungry
    </p>
    <p>
     mother with cubs met a man on her own ground she would, in my opinion, try
    </p>
    <p>
     to catch and eat him. This would be only fair play anyhow, for we eat them, but
    </p>
    <p>
     nobody hereabout has been used for bear grub that I know of."
    </p>
    <p>
     Brown had left his mountain home ere we arrived, but a considerable number
    </p>
    <p>
     of Digger Indians still linger in their cedar-bark huts on the edge of the flat.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were attracted in the first place by the white hunter whom they had
    </p>
    <p>
     learned to respect, and to whom they looked for guidance and protection
    </p>
    <p>
     against their enemies the Pah Utes, who sometimes made raids across from the
    </p>
    <p>
     east side of the Range to plunder the stores of the comparatively feeble Diggers
    </p>
    <p>
     and steal their wives.

     CHAPTER II
    </head>
    <p>
     IN CAMP ON THE NORTH FORK OF THE MERCED
    </p>
    <p>
     June . The sheep, now grassy and good-natured, slowly nibbled their way down
    </p>
    <p>
     into the valley of the North Fork of the Merced at the foot of Pilot Peak Ridge to
    </p>
    <p>
     the place selected by the Don for our first central camp, a picturesque hoppershaped hollow formed by converging hill slopes at a bend of the river. Here
    </p>
    <p>
     racks for dishes and provisions were made in the shade of the river-bank trees,
    </p>
    <p>
     and beds of fern fronds, cedar plumes, and various flowers, each to the taste of
    </p>
    <p>
     its owner, and a corral back on the open flat for the wool.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . How deep our sleep last night in the mountain's heart, beneath the trees
    </p>
    <p>
     and stars, hushed by solemn-sounding waterfalls and many small soothing
    </p>
    <p>
     voices in sweet accord whispering peace! And our first pure mountain day,
    </p>
    <p>
     warm, calm, cloudless,—how immeasurable it seems, how serenely wild! I can
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely remember its beginning. Along the river, over the hills, in the ground,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the sky, spring work is going on with joyful enthusiasm, new life, new
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty, unfolding, unrolling in glorious exuberant extravagance, —new birds in
    </p>
    <p>
     their nests, new winged creatures in the air, and new leaves, new flowers,
    </p>
    <p>
     spreading, shining, rejoicing everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     The trees about the camp stand close, giving ample shade for ferns and lilies,
    </p>
    <p>
     while back from the bank most of the sunshine reaches the ground, calling up
    </p>
    <p>
     the grasses and flowers in glorious array, tall bromus waving like bamboos,
    </p>
    <p>
     starry compositæ, monardella, Mariposa tulips, lupines, gilias, violets, glad
    </p>
    <p>
     children of light. Soon every fern frond will be unrolled, great beds of common
    </p>
    <p>
     pteris and woodwardia along the river, wreaths and rosettes of pellæa and
    </p>
    <p>
     cheilanthes on sunny rocks. Some of the woodwardia fronds are already six
    </p>
    <p>
     feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
     A handsome little shrub, Chamæbatia foliolosa, belonging to the rose family,
    </p>
    <p>
     spreads a yellow-green mantle beneath the sugar pines for miles without a
    </p>
    <p>
     break, not mixed or roughened with other plants. Only here and there a
    </p>
    <p>
     Washington lily may be seen nodding above its even surface, or a bunch or two
    </p>
    <p>
     of tall bromus as if for ornament. This fine carpet shrub begins to appear at,
    </p>
    <p>
     say, twenty-five hundred or three thousand feet above sea level, is about knee
    </p>
    <p>
     high or less, has brown branches, and the largest stems are only about half an
    </p>
    <p>
     inch in diameter. The leaves, light yellow green, thrice pinnate and finely cut,
    </p>
    <p>
     give them a rich ferny appearance, and they are dotted with minute glands that
    </p>
    <p>
     secrete wax with a peculiar pleasant odor that blends finely with the spicy
    </p>
    <p>
     fragrance of the pines. The flowers are white, five eighths of an inch in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter, and look like those of the strawberry. Am delighted with this little
    </p>
    <p>
     bush. It is the only true carpet shrub of this part of the Sierra. The manzanita,
    </p>
    <p>
     rhamnus, and most of the species of ceanothus make shaggy rugs and border
    </p>
    <p>
     fringes rather than carpets or mantles.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sheep do not take kindly to their new pastures, perhaps from being too
    </p>
    <p>
     closely hemmed in by the hills. They are never fully at rest. Last night they
    </p>
    <p>
     were frightened, probably by bears or coyotes prowling and planning for a
    </p>
    <p>
     share of the grand mass of mutton.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Very warm. We get water for the camp from a rock basin at the foot of a
    </p>
    <p>
     picturesque cascading reach of the river where it is well stirred and made lively
    </p>
    <p>
     without being beaten into dusty foam. The rock here is black metamorphic
    </p>
    <p>
     slate, worn into smooth knobs in the stream channels, contrasting with the
    </p>
    <p>
     fine gray and white cascading water as it glides and glances and falls in lacelike sheets and braided overfolding currents. Tufts of sedge growing on the
    </p>
    <p>
     rock knobs that rise above the surface produce a charming effect, the long
    </p>
    <p>
     elastic leaves arching over in every direction, the tips of the longest drooping
    </p>
    <p>
     into the current, which dividing against the projecting rocks makes still finer
    </p>
    <p>
     lines, uniting with the sedges to see how beautiful the happy stream can be
    </p>
    <p>
     made. Nor is this all, for the giant saxifrage also is growing on some of the knob
    </p>
    <p>
     rock islets, firmly anchored and displaying their broad, round, umbrella-like
    </p>
    <p>
     leaves in showy groups by themselves, or above the sedge tufts. The flowers of
    </p>
    <p>
     this species Saxifraga peltata are purple, and form tall glandular racemes that
    </p>
    <p>
     are in bloom before the appearance of the leaves. The fleshy root-stocks grip
    </p>
    <p>
     the rock in cracks and hollows, and thus enable the plant to hold on against
    </p>
    <p>
     occasional floods,—a marked species employed by Nature to make yet more
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful the most interesting portions of these cool clear streams. Near camp
    </p>
    <p>
     the trees arch over from bank to bank, making a leafy tunnel full of soft
    </p>
    <p>
     subdued light, through which the young river sings and shines like a happy
    </p>
    <p>
     living creature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heard a few peals of thunder from the upper Sierra, and saw firm white bossy
    </p>
    <p>
     cumuli rising back of the pines. This was about noon.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . On one of the eastern branches of the river discovered some charming
    </p>
    <p>
     cascades with a pool at the foot of each of them. White dashing water, a few
    </p>
    <p>
     bushes and tufts of carex on ledges leaning over with fine effect, and large
    </p>
    <p>
     orange lilies assembled in superb groups on fertile soil-beds beside the pools.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are no large meadows or grassy plains near camp to supply lasting
    </p>
    <p>
     pasture for our thousands of busy nibblers. The main dependence is ceanothus
    </p>
    <p>
     brush on the hills and tufted grass patches here and there, with lupines and
    </p>
    <p>
     pea-vines among the flowers on sunny open spaces. Large areas have already
    </p>
    <p>
     been stripped bare, or nearly so, compelling the poor hungry wool bundles to
    </p>
    <p>
     scatter far and wide, keeping the shepherds and dogs at the top of their speed
    </p>
    <p>
     to hold them within bounds. Mr. Delaney has gone back to the plains, taking
    </p>
    <p>
     the Indian and Chinaman with him, leaving instruction to keep the flock here
    </p>
    <p>
     or hereabouts until his return, which he promised would not be long delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
     How fine the weather is! Nothing more celestial can I conceive. How gently the
    </p>
    <p>
     winds blow! Scarce can these tranquil air-currents be called winds. They seem
    </p>
    <p>
     the very breath of Nature, whispering peace to every living thing. Down in the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp dell there is no swaying of tree-tops; most of the time not a leaf moves. I
    </p>
    <p>
     don't remember having seen a single lily swinging on its stalk, though they are
    </p>
    <p>
     so tall the least breeze would rock them. What grand bells these lilies have!
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of them big enough for children's bonnets. I have been sketching them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and would fain draw every leaf of their wide shining whorls and every curved
    </p>
    <p>
     and spotted petal. More beautiful, better kept gardens cannot be imagined. The
    </p>
    <p>
     species is Lilium pardalinum, five to six feet high, leaf-whorls a foot wide,
    </p>
    <p>
     flowers about six inches wide, bright orange, purple spotted in the throat,
    </p>
    <p>
     segments revolute—a majestic plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . A slight sprinkle of rain—large drops far apart, falling with hearty pat
    </p>
    <p>
     and plash on leaves and stones and into the mouths of the flowers. Cumuli
    </p>
    <p>
     rising to the eastward. How beautiful their pearly bosses! How well they
    </p>
    <p>
     harmonize with the upswelling rocks beneath them. Mountains of the sky,
    </p>
    <p>
     solid-looking, finely sculptured, their richly varied topography wonderfully
    </p>
    <p>
     defined. Never before have I seen clouds so substantial looking in form and
    </p>
    <p>
     texture. Nearly every day toward noon they rise with visible swelling motion as
    </p>
    <p>
     if new worlds were being created. And how fondly they brood and hover over
    </p>
    <p>
     the gardens and forests with their cooling shadows and showers, keeping every
    </p>
    <p>
     petal and leaf in glad health and heart. One may fancy the clouds themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     are plants, springing up in the sky-fields at the call of the sun, growing in
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty until they reach their prime, scattering rain and hail like berries and
    </p>
    <p>
     seeds, then wilting and dying.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mountain live oak, common here and a thousand feet or so higher, is like
    </p>
    <p>
     the live oak of Florida, not only in general appearance, foliage, bark, and widebranching habit, but in its tough, knotty, unwedgeable wood. Standing alone
    </p>
    <p>
     with plenty of elbow room, the largest trees are about seven to eight feet in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter near the ground, sixty feet high, and as wide or wider across the
    </p>
    <p>
     head. The leaves are small and undivided, mostly without teeth or wavy edging,
    </p>
    <p>
     though on young shoots some are sharply serrated, both kinds being found on
    </p>
    <p>
     the same tree. The cups of the medium-sized acorns are shallow, thick walled,
    </p>
    <p>
     and covered with a golden dust of minute hairs. Some of the trees have hardly
    </p>
    <p>
     any main trunk, dividing near the ground into large wide-spreading limbs, and
    </p>
    <p>
     these, dividing again and again, terminate in long, drooping, cord-like
    </p>
    <p>
     branchlets, many of which reach nearly to the ground, while a dense canopy of
    </p>
    <p>
     short, shining, leafy branchlets forms a round head which looks something
    </p>
    <p>
     like a cumulus cloud when the sunshine is pouring over it.
    </p>
    <p>
     MOUNTAIN LIVE OAK Quercus chrysolepis, EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER
    </p>
    <p>
     A marked plant is the bush poppy Dendromecon rigidum, found on the hot
    </p>
    <p>
     hillsides near camp, the only woody member of the order I have yet met in all
    </p>
    <p>
     my walks. Its flowers are bright orange yellow, an inch to two inches wide,
    </p>
    <p>
     fruit-pods three or four inches long, slender and curving,—height of bushes
    </p>
    <p>
     about four feet, made up of many slim, straight branches, radiating from the
    </p>
    <p>
     root,—a companion of the manzanita and other sun-loving chaparral shrubs.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Another glorious Sierra day in which one seems to be dissolved and
    </p>
    <p>
     absorbed and sent pulsing onward we know not where. Life seems neither long
    </p>
    <p>
     nor short, and we take no more heed to save time or make haste than do the
    </p>
    <p>
     trees and stars. This is true freedom, a good practical sort of immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yonder rises another white skyland. How sharply the yellow pine spires and the
    </p>
    <p>
     palm-like crowns of the sugar pines are outlined on its smooth white domes.
    </p>
    <p>
     And hark! the grand thunder billows booming, rolling from ridge to ridge,
    </p>
    <p>
     followed by the faithful shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     A good many herbaceous plants come thus far up the mountains from the
    </p>
    <p>
     plains, and are now in flower, two months later than their low land relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Saw a few columbines to-day. Most of the ferns are in their prime,—rock ferns
    </p>
    <p>
     on the sunny hillsides, cheilanthes, pellæa, gymnogramme; woodwardia,
    </p>
    <p>
     aspidium, woodsia along the stream banks, and the common Pteris aquilina on
    </p>
    <p>
     sandy flats. This last, however common, is here making shows of strong,
    </p>
    <p>
     exuberant, abounding beauty to set the botanist wild with admiration. I
    </p>
    <p>
     measured some scarce full grown that are more than seven feet high. Though
    </p>
    <p>
     the commonest and most widely distributed of all the ferns, I might almost say
    </p>
    <p>
     that I never saw it before. The broad-shouldered fronds held high on smooth
    </p>
    <p>
     stout stalks growing close together, overleaning and overlapping, make a
    </p>
    <p>
     complete ceiling, beneath which one may walk erect over several acres without
    </p>
    <p>
     being seen, as if beneath a roof. And how soft and lovely the light streaming
    </p>
    <p>
     through this living ceiling, revealing the arching branching ribs and veins of
    </p>
    <p>
     the fronds as the framework of countless panes of pale green and yellow plantglass nicely fitted together—a fairyland created out of the commonest fernstuff.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smaller animals wander about as if in a tropical forest. I saw the entire
    </p>
    <p>
     flock of sheep vanish at one side of a patch and reappear a hundred yards
    </p>
    <p>
     farther on at the other, their progress betrayed only by the jerking and
    </p>
    <p>
     trembling of the fronds; and strange to say very few of the stout woody stalks
    </p>
    <p>
     were broken. I sat a long time beneath the tallest fronds, and never enjoyed
    </p>
    <p>
     anything in the way of a bower of wild leaves more strangely impressive. Only
    </p>
    <p>
     spread a fern frond over a man's head and worldly cares are cast out, and
    </p>
    <p>
     freedom and beauty and peace come in. The waving of a pine tree on the top of
    </p>
    <p>
     a mountain,—a magic wand in Nature's hand,—every devout mountaineer
    </p>
    <p>
     knows its power; but the marvelous beauty value of what the Scotch call a
    </p>
    <p>
     breckan in a still dell, what poet has sung this? It would seem impossible that
    </p>
    <p>
     any one, however incrusted with care, could escape the Godful influence of
    </p>
    <p>
     these sacred fern forests. Yet this very day I saw a shepherd pass through one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the finest of them without betraying more feeling than his sheep. "What do
    </p>
    <p>
     you think of these grand ferns?" I asked. "Oh, they're only d——d big brakes,"
    </p>
    <p>
     he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lizards of every temper, style, and color dwell here, seemingly as happy and
    </p>
    <p>
     companionable as the birds and squirrels. Lowly, gentle fellow mortals,
    </p>
    <p>
     enjoying God's sunshine, and doing the best they can in getting a living, I like
    </p>
    <p>
     to watch them at their work and play. They bear acquaintance well, and one
    </p>
    <p>
     likes them the better the longer one looks into their beautiful, innocent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     They are easily tamed, and one soon learns to love them, as they dart about on
    </p>
    <p>
     the hot rocks, swift as dragon-flies. The eye can hardly follow them; but they
    </p>
    <p>
     never make long-sustained runs, usually only about ten or twelve feet, then a
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden stop, and as sudden a start again; going all their journeys by quick,
    </p>
    <p>
     jerking impulses. These many stops I find are necessary as rests, for they are
    </p>
    <p>
     short-winded, and when pursued steadily are soon out of breath, pant pitifully,
    </p>
    <p>
     and are easily caught. Their bodies are more than half tail, but these tails are
    </p>
    <p>
     well managed, never heavily dragged nor curved up as if hard to carry; on the
    </p>
    <p>
     contrary, they seem to follow the body lightly of their own will. Some are
    </p>
    <p>
     colored like the sky, bright as bluebirds, others gray like the lichened rocks on
    </p>
    <p>
     which they hunt and bask. Even the horned toad of the plains is a mild,
    </p>
    <p>
     harmless creature, and so are the snake-like species which glide in curves with
    </p>
    <p>
     true snake motion, while their small, undeveloped limbs drag as useless
    </p>
    <p>
     appendages. One specimen fourteen inches long which I observed closely made
    </p>
    <p>
     no use whatever of its tender, sprouting limbs, but glided with all the soft, sly
    </p>
    <p>
     ease and grace of a snake. Here comes a little, gray, dusty fellow who seems to
    </p>
    <p>
     know and trust me, running about my feet, and looking up cunningly into my
    </p>
    <p>
     face. Carlo is watching, makes a quick pounce on him, for the fun of the thing I
    </p>
    <p>
     suppose; but Liz has shot away from his paws like an arrow, and is safe in the
    </p>
    <p>
     recesses of a clump of chaparral. Gentle saurians, dragons, descendants of an
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient and mighty race, Heaven bless you all and make your virtues known!
    </p>
    <p>
     for few of us know as yet that scales may cover fellow creatures as gentle and
    </p>
    <p>
     lovable as feathers, or hair, or cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mastodons and elephants used to live here no great geological time ago, as
    </p>
    <p>
     shown by their bones, often discovered by miners in washing gold-gravel. And
    </p>
    <p>
     bears of at least two species are here now, besides the California lion or
    </p>
    <p>
     panther, and wild cats, wolves, foxes, snakes, scorpions, wasps, tarantulas;
    </p>
    <p>
     but one is almost tempted at times to regard a small savage black ant as the
    </p>
    <p>
     master existence of this vast mountain world. These fearless, restless,
    </p>
    <p>
     wandering imps, though only about a quarter of an inch long, are fonder of
    </p>
    <p>
     fighting and biting than any beast I know. They attack every living thing
    </p>
    <p>
     around their homes, often without cause as far as I can see. Their bodies are
    </p>
    <p>
     mostly jaws curved like ice-hooks, and to get work for these weapons seems to
    </p>
    <p>
     be their chief aim and pleasure. Most of their colonies are established in living
    </p>
    <p>
     oaks somewhat decayed or hollowed, in which they can conveniently build their
    </p>
    <p>
     cells. These are chosen probably because of their strength as opposed to the
    </p>
    <p>
     attacks of animals and storms. They work both day and night, creep into dark
    </p>
    <p>
     caves, climb the highest trees, wander and hunt through cool ravines as well as
    </p>
    <p>
     on hot, unshaded ridges, and extend their highways and byways over
    </p>
    <p>
     everything but water and sky. From the foothills to a mile above the level of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sea nothing can stir without their knowledge; and alarms are spread in an
    </p>
    <p>
     incredibly short time, without any howl or cry that we can hear. I can't
    </p>
    <p>
     understand the need of their ferocious courage; there seems to be no common
    </p>
    <p>
     sense in it. Sometimes, no doubt, they fight in defense of their homes, but they
    </p>
    <p>
     fight anywhere and always wherever they can find anything to bite. As soon as
    </p>
    <p>
     a vulnerable spot is discovered on man or beast, they stand on their heads and
    </p>
    <p>
     sink their jaws, and though torn limb from limb, they will yet hold on and die
    </p>
    <p>
     biting deeper. When I contemplate this fierce creature so widely distributed and
    </p>
    <p>
     strongly intrenched, I see that much remains to be done ere the world is
    </p>
    <p>
     brought under the rule of universal peace and love.
    </p>
    <p>
     On my way to camp a few minutes ago, I passed a dead pine nearly ten feet in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter. It has been enveloped in fire from top to bottom so that now it looks
    </p>
    <p>
     like a grand black pillar set up as a monument. In this noble shaft a colony of
    </p>
    <p>
     large jet-black ants have established themselves, laboriously cutting tunnels
    </p>
    <p>
     and cells through the wood, whether sound or decayed. The entire trunk seems
    </p>
    <p>
     to have been honeycombed, judging by the size of the talus of gnawed chips
    </p>
    <p>
     like sawdust piled up around its base. They are more intelligent looking than
    </p>
    <p>
     their small, belligerent, strong-scented brethren, and have better manners,
    </p>
    <p>
     though quick to fight when required. Their towns are carved in fallen trunks as
    </p>
    <p>
     well as in those left standing, but never in sound, living trees or in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     When you happen to sit down to rest or take notes near a colony, some
    </p>
    <p>
     wandering hunter is sure to find you and come cautiously forward to discover
    </p>
    <p>
     the nature of the intruder and what ought to be done. If you are not too near
    </p>
    <p>
     the town and keep perfectly still he may run across your feet a few times, over
    </p>
    <p>
     your legs and hands and face, up your trousers, as if taking your measure and
    </p>
    <p>
     getting comprehensive views, then go in peace without raising an alarm. If,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, a tempting spot is offered or some suspicious movement excites him,
    </p>
    <p>
     a bite follows, and such a bite! I fancy that a bear or wolf bite is not to be
    </p>
    <p>
     compared with it. A quick electric flame of pain flashes along the outraged
    </p>
    <p>
     nerves, and you discover for the first time how great is the capacity for
    </p>
    <p>
     sensation you are possessed of. A shriek, a grab for the animal, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     bewildered stare follow this bite of bites as one comes back to consciousness
    </p>
    <p>
     from sudden eclipse. Fortunately, if careful, one need not be bitten oftener than
    </p>
    <p>
     once or twice in a lifetime. This wonderful electric species is about three
    </p>
    <p>
     fourths of an inch long. Bears are fond of them, and tear and gnaw their homelogs to pieces, and roughly devour the eggs, larvæ, parent ants, and the rotten
    </p>
    <p>
     or sound wood of the cells, all in one spicy acid hash. The Digger Indians also
    </p>
    <p>
     are fond of the larvæ and even of the perfect ants, so I have been told by old
    </p>
    <p>
     mountaineers. They bite off and reject the head, and eat the tickly acid body
    </p>
    <p>
     with keen relish. Thus are the poor biters bitten, like every other biter, big or
    </p>
    <p>
     little, in the world's great family.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is also a fine, active, intelligent-looking red species, intermediate in size
    </p>
    <p>
     between the above. They dwell in the ground, and build large piles of seed
    </p>
    <p>
     husks, leaves, straw, etc., over their nests. Their food seems to be mostly
    </p>
    <p>
     insects and plant leaves, seeds and sap. How many mouths Nature has to fill,
    </p>
    <p>
     how many neighbors we have, how little we know about them, and how seldom
    </p>
    <p>
     we get in each other's way! Then to think of the infinite numbers of smaller
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow mortals, invisibly small, compared with which the smallest ants are as
    </p>
    <p>
     mastodons.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . The pool-basins below the falls and cascades hereabouts, formed by the
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy down-plunging currents, are kept nicely clean and clear of detritus. The
    </p>
    <p>
     heavier parts of the material swept over the falls are heaped up a short
    </p>
    <p>
     distance in front of the basins in the form of a dam, thus tending, together with
    </p>
    <p>
     erosion, to increase their size. Sudden changes, however, are effected during
    </p>
    <p>
     the spring floods, when the snow is melting and the upper tributaries are
    </p>
    <p>
     roaring loud from "bank to brae." Then boulders that have fallen into the
    </p>
    <p>
     channels, and which the ordinary summer and winter currents were unable to
    </p>
    <p>
     move, are suddenly swept forward as by a mighty besom, hurled over the falls
    </p>
    <p>
     into these pools, and piled up in a new dam together with part of the old one,
    </p>
    <p>
     while some of the smaller boulders are carried further down stream and
    </p>
    <p>
     variously lodged according to size and shape, all seeking rest where the force of
    </p>
    <p>
     the current is less than the resistance they are able to offer. But the greatest
    </p>
    <p>
     changes made in these relations of fall, pool, and dam are caused, not by the
    </p>
    <p>
     ordinary spring floods, but by extraordinary ones that occur at irregular
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals. The testimony of trees growing on flood boulder deposits shows that
    </p>
    <p>
     a century or more has passed since the last master flood came to awaken
    </p>
    <p>
     everything movable to go swirling and dancing on wonderful journeys. These
    </p>
    <p>
     floods may occur during the summer, when heavy thunder-showers, called
    </p>
    <p>
     "cloud-bursts," fall on wide, steeply inclined stream basins furrowed by
    </p>
    <p>
     converging channels, which suddenly gather the waters together into the main
    </p>
    <p>
     trunk in booming torrents of enormous transporting power, though short lived.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of these ancient flood boulders stands firm in the middle of the stream
    </p>
    <p>
     channel, just below the lower edge of the pool dam at the foot of the fall nearest
    </p>
    <p>
     our camp. It is a nearly cubical mass of granite about eight feet high, plushed
    </p>
    <p>
     with mosses over the top and down the sides to ordinary high-water mark.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I climbed on top of it to-day and lay down to rest, it seemed the most
    </p>
    <p>
     romantic spot I had yet found—the one big stone with its mossy level top and
    </p>
    <p>
     smooth sides standing square and firm and solitary, like an altar, the fall in
    </p>
    <p>
     front of it bathing it lightly with the finest of the spray, just enough to keep its
    </p>
    <p>
     moss cover fresh; the clear green pool beneath, with its foam-bells and its half
    </p>
    <p>
     circle of lilies leaning forward like a band of admirers, and flowering dogwood
    </p>
    <p>
     and alder trees leaning over all in sun-sifted arches. How soothingly, restfully
    </p>
    <p>
     cool it is beneath that leafy, translucent ceiling, and how delightful the water
    </p>
    <p>
     music—the deep bass tones of the fall, the clashing, ringing spray, and infinite
    </p>
    <p>
     variety of small low tones of the current gliding past the side of the boulderisland, and glinting against a thousand smaller stones down the ferny channel!
    </p>
    <p>
     All this shut in; every one of these influences acting at short range as if in a
    </p>
    <p>
     quiet room. The place seemed holy, where one might hope to see God.
    </p>
    <p>
     After dark, when the camp was at rest, I groped my way back to the altar
    </p>
    <p>
     boulder and passed the night on it,—above the water, beneath the leaves and
    </p>
    <p>
     stars,—everything still more impressive than by day, the fall seen dimly white,
    </p>
    <p>
     singing Nature's old love song with solemn enthusiasm, while the stars peering
    </p>
    <p>
     through the leaf-roof seemed to join in the white water's song. Precious night,
    </p>
    <p>
     precious day to abide in me forever. Thanks be to God for this immortal gift.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Another reviving morning. Down the long mountain-slopes the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunbeams pour, gilding the awakening pines, cheering every needle, filling
    </p>
    <p>
     every living thing with joy. Robins are singing in the alder and maple groves,
    </p>
    <p>
     the same old song that has cheered and sweetened countless seasons over
    </p>
    <p>
     almost all of our blessed continent. In this mountain hollow they seem as
    </p>
    <p>
     much at home as in farmers' orchards. Bullock's oriole and the Louisiana
    </p>
    <p>
     tanager are here also, with many warblers and other little mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     troubadours, most of them now busy about their nests.
    </p>
    <p>
     Discovered another magnificent specimen of the goldcup oak six feet in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter, a Douglas spruce seven feet, and a twining lily Stropholirion, with
    </p>
    <p>
     stem eight feet long, and sixty rose-colored flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
     SUGAR PINE
    </p>
    <p>
     Sugar pine cones are cylindrical, slightly tapered at the end and rounded at the
    </p>
    <p>
     base. Found one to-day nearly twenty-four inches long and six in diameter, the
    </p>
    <p>
     scales being open. Another specimen nineteen inches long; the average length
    </p>
    <p>
     of full-grown cones on trees favorably situated is nearly eighteen inches. On the
    </p>
    <p>
     lower edge of the belt at a height of about twenty-five hundred feet above the
    </p>
    <p>
     sea they are smaller, say a foot to fifteen inches long, and at a height of seven
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand feet or more near the upper limits of its growth in the Yosemite
    </p>
    <p>
     region they are about the same size. This noble tree is an inexhaustible study
    </p>
    <p>
     and source of pleasure. I never weary of gazing at its grand tassel cones, its
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly round bole one hundred feet or more without a limb, the fine purplish
    </p>
    <p>
     color of its bark, and its magnificent outsweeping, down-curving feathery arms
    </p>
    <p>
     forming a crown always bold and striking and exhilarating. In habit and
    </p>
    <p>
     general port it looks somewhat like a palm, but no palm that I have yet seen
    </p>
    <p>
     displays such majesty of form and behavior either when poised silent and
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughtful in sunshine, or wide-awake waving in storm winds with every
    </p>
    <p>
     needle quivering. When young it is very straight and regular in form like most
    </p>
    <p>
     other conifers; but at the age of fifty to one hundred years it begins to acquire
    </p>
    <p>
     individuality, so that no two are alike in their prime or old age. Every tree calls
    </p>
    <p>
     for special admiration. I have been making many sketches, and regret that I
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot draw every needle. It is said to reach a height of three hundred feet,
    </p>
    <p>
     though the tallest I have measured falls short of this stature sixty feet or more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The diameter of the largest near the ground is about ten feet, though I've heard
    </p>
    <p>
     of some twelve feet thick or even fifteen. The diameter is held to a great height,
    </p>
    <p>
     the taper being almost imperceptibly gradual. Its companion, the yellow pine, is
    </p>
    <p>
     almost as large. The long silvery foliage of the younger specimens forms
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificent cylindrical brushes on the top shoots and the ends of the upturned
    </p>
    <p>
     branches, and when the wind sways the needles all one way at a certain angle
    </p>
    <p>
     every tree becomes a tower of white quivering sun-fire. Well may this shining
    </p>
    <p>
     species be called the silver pine. The needles are sometimes more than a foot
    </p>
    <p>
     long, almost as long as those of the long-leaf pine of Florida. But though in size
    </p>
    <p>
     the yellow pine almost equals the sugar pine, and in rugged enduring strength
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to surpass it, it is far less marked in general habit and expression, with
    </p>
    <p>
     its regular conventional spire and its comparatively small cones clustered stiffly
    </p>
    <p>
     among the needles. Were there no sugar pine, then would this be the king of
    </p>
    <p>
     the world's eighty or ninety species, the brightest of the bright, waving,
    </p>
    <p>
     worshiping multitude. Were they mere mechanical sculptures, what noble
    </p>
    <p>
     objects they would still be! How much more throbbing, thrilling, overflowing,
    </p>
    <p>
     full of life in every fiber and cell, grand glowing silver-rods—the very gods of the
    </p>
    <p>
     plant kingdom, living their sublime century lives in sight of Heaven, watched
    </p>
    <p>
     and loved and admired from generation to generation! And how many other
    </p>
    <p>
     radiant resiny sun trees are here and higher up,—libocedrus, Douglas spruce,
    </p>
    <p>
     silver fir, sequoia. How rich our inheritance in these blessed mountains, the
    </p>
    <p>
     tree pastures into which our eyes are turned!
    </p>
    <p>
     Now comes sundown. The west is all a glory of color transfiguring everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far up the Pilot Peak Ridge the radiant host of trees stand hushed and
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughtful, receiving the Sun's good-night, as solemn and impressive a leavetaking as if sun and trees were to meet no more. The daylight fades, the color
    </p>
    <p>
     spell is broken, and the forest breathes free in the night breeze beneath the
    </p>
    <p>
     stars.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . One of the Indians from Brown's Flat got right into the middle of the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp this morning, unobserved. I was seated on a stone, looking over my notes
    </p>
    <p>
     and sketches, and happening to look up, was startled to see him standing grim
    </p>
    <p>
     and silent within a few steps of me, as motionless and weather-stained as an
    </p>
    <p>
     old tree-stump that had stood there for centuries. All Indians seem to have
    </p>
    <p>
     learned this wonderful way of walking unseen,—making themselves invisible
    </p>
    <p>
     like certain spiders I have been observing here, which, in case of alarm,
    </p>
    <p>
     caused, for example, by a bird alighting on the bush their webs are spread
    </p>
    <p>
     upon, immediately bounce themselves up and down on their elastic threads so
    </p>
    <p>
     rapidly that only a blur is visible. The wild Indian power of escaping
    </p>
    <p>
     observation, even where there is little or no cover to hide in, was probably
    </p>
    <p>
     slowly acquired in hard hunting and fighting lessons while trying to approach
    </p>
    <p>
     game, take enemies by surprise, or get safely away when compelled to retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
     And this experience transmitted through many generations seems at length to
    </p>
    <p>
     have become what is vaguely called instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
     How smooth and changeless seems the surface of the mountains about us!
    </p>
    <p>
     Scarce a track is to be found beyond the range of the sheep except on small
    </p>
    <p>
     open spots on the sides of the streams, or where the forest carpets are thin or
    </p>
    <p>
     wanting. On the smoothest of these open strips and patches deer tracks may
    </p>
    <p>
     be seen, and the great suggestive footprints of bears, which, with those of the
    </p>
    <p>
     many small animals, are scarce enough to answer as a kind of light ornamental
    </p>
    <p>
     stitching or embroidery. Along the main ridges and larger branches of the river
    </p>
    <p>
     Indian trails may be traced, but they are not nearly as distinct as one would
    </p>
    <p>
     expect to find them. How many centuries Indians have roamed these woods
    </p>
    <p>
     nobody knows, probably a great many, extending far beyond the time that
    </p>
    <p>
     Columbus touched our shores, and it seems strange that heavier marks have
    </p>
    <p>
     not been made. Indians walk softly and hurt the landscape hardly more than
    </p>
    <p>
     the birds and squirrels, and their brush and bark huts last hardly longer than
    </p>
    <p>
     those of wood rats, while their more enduring monuments, excepting those
    </p>
    <p>
     wrought on the forests by the fires they made to improve their hunting
    </p>
    <p>
     grounds, vanish in a few centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
     How different are most of those of the white man, especially on the lower gold
    </p>
    <p>
     region—roads blasted in the solid rock, wild streams dammed and tamed and
    </p>
    <p>
     turned out of their channels and led along the sides of cañons and valleys to
    </p>
    <p>
     work in mines like slaves. Crossing from ridge to ridge, high in the air, on long
    </p>
    <p>
     straddling trestles as if flowing on stilts, or down and up across valleys and
    </p>
    <p>
     hills, imprisoned in iron pipes to strike and wash away hills and miles of the
    </p>
    <p>
     skin of the mountain's face, riddling, stripping every gold gully and flat. These
    </p>
    <p>
     are the white man's marks made in a few feverish years, to say nothing of mills,
    </p>
    <p>
     fields, villages, scattered hundreds of miles along the flank of the Range. Long
    </p>
    <p>
     will it be ere these marks are effaced, though Nature is doing what she can,
    </p>
    <p>
     replanting, gardening, sweeping away old dams and flumes, leveling gravel and
    </p>
    <p>
     boulder piles, patiently trying to heal every raw scar. The main gold storm is
    </p>
    <p>
     over. Calm enough are the gray old miners scratching a bare living in waste
    </p>
    <p>
     diggings here and there. Thundering underground blasting is still going on to
    </p>
    <p>
     feed the pounding quartz mills, but their influence on the landscape is light as
    </p>
    <p>
     compared with that of the pick-and-shovel storms waged a few years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately for Sierra scenery the gold-bearing slates are mostly restricted to
    </p>
    <p>
     the foothills. The region about our camp is still wild, and higher lies the snow
    </p>
    <p>
     about as trackless as the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only a few hills and domes of cloudland were built yesterday and none at all
    </p>
    <p>
     to-day. The light is peculiarly white and thin, though pleasantly warm. The
    </p>
    <p>
     serenity of this mountain weather in the spring, just when Nature's pulses are
    </p>
    <p>
     beating highest, is one of its greatest charms. There is only a moderate breeze
    </p>
    <p>
     from the summits of the Range at night, and a slight breathing from the sea
    </p>
    <p>
     and the lowland hills and plains during the day, or stillness so complete no leaf
    </p>
    <p>
     stirs. The trees hereabouts have but little wind history to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sheep, like people, are ungovernable when hungry. Excepting my guarded lily
    </p>
    <p>
     gardens, almost every leaf that these hoofed locusts can reach within a radius
    </p>
    <p>
     of a mile or two from camp has been devoured. Even the bushes are stripped
    </p>
    <p>
     bare, and in spite of dogs and shepherds the sheep scatter to all points of the
    </p>
    <p>
     compass and vanish in dust. I fear some are lost, for one of the sixteen black
    </p>
    <p>
     ones is missing.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Counted the wool bundles this morning as they bounced through the
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow corral gate. About three hundred are missing, and as the shepherd
    </p>
    <p>
     could not go to seek them, I had to go. I tied a crust of bread to my belt, and
    </p>
    <p>
     with Carlo set out for the upper slopes of the Pilot Peak Ridge, and had a good
    </p>
    <p>
     day, notwithstanding the care of seeking the silly runaways. I went out for
    </p>
    <p>
     wool, and did not come back shorn. A peculiar light circled around the horizon,
    </p>
    <p>
     white and thin like that often seen over the auroral corona, blending into the
    </p>
    <p>
     blue of the upper sky. The only clouds were a few faint flossy pencilings like
    </p>
    <p>
     combed silk. I pushed direct to the boundary of the usual range of the flock,
    </p>
    <p>
     and around it until I found the outgoing trail of the wanderers. It led far up the
    </p>
    <p>
     ridge into an open place surrounded by a hedge-like growth of ceanothus
    </p>
    <p>
     chaparral. Carlo knew what I was about, and eagerly followed the scent until
    </p>
    <p>
     we came up to them, huddled in a timid, silent bunch. They had evidently been
    </p>
    <p>
     here all night and all the forenoon, afraid to go out to feed. Having escaped
    </p>
    <p>
     restraint, they were, like some people we know of, afraid of their freedom, did
    </p>
    <p>
     not know what to do with it, and seemed glad to get back into the old familiar
    </p>
    <p>
     bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Another inspiring morning, noth ing better in any world can be
    </p>
    <p>
     conceived. No description of Heaven that I have ever heard or read of seems
    </p>
    <p>
     half so fine. At noon the clouds occupied about . of the sky, white filmy touches
    </p>
    <p>
     drawn delicately on the azure.
    </p>
    <p>
     The high ridges and hilltops beyond the woolly locusts are now gay with
    </p>
    <p>
     monardella, clarkia, coreopsis, and tall tufted grasses, some of them tall
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to wave like pines. The lupines, of which there are many ill-defined
    </p>
    <p>
     species, are now mostly out of flower, and many of the compositæ are
    </p>
    <p>
     beginning to fade, their radiant corollas vanishing in fluffy pappus like stars in
    </p>
    <p>
     mist.
    </p>
    <p>
     We had another visitor from Brown's Flat to-day, an old Indian woman with a
    </p>
    <p>
     basket on her back. Like our first caller from the village, she got fairly into
    </p>
    <p>
     camp and was standing in plain view when discovered. How long she had been
    </p>
    <p>
     quietly looking on, I cannot say. Even the dogs failed to notice her stealthy
    </p>
    <p>
     approach. She was on her way, I suppose, to some wild garden, probably for
    </p>
    <p>
     lupine and starchy saxifrage leaves and rootstocks. Her dress was calico rags,
    </p>
    <p>
     far from clean. In every way she seemed sadly unlike Nature's neat welldressed animals, though living like them on the bounty of the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strange that mankind alone is dirty. Had she been clad in fur, or cloth woven
    </p>
    <p>
     of grass or shreddy bark, like the juniper and libocedrus mats, she might then
    </p>
    <p>
     have seemed a rightful part of the wilderness; like a good wolf at least, or bear.
    </p>
    <p>
     But from no point of view that I have found are such debased fellow beings a
    </p>
    <p>
     whit more natural than the glaring tailored tourists we saw that frightened the
    </p>
    <p>
     birds and squirrels.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Pure sunshine all day. How beautiful a rock is made by leaf shadows!
    </p>
    <p>
     Those of the live oak are particularly clear and distinct, and beyond all art in
    </p>
    <p>
     grace and delicacy, now still as if painted on stone, now gliding softly as if
    </p>
    <p>
     afraid of noise, now dancing, waltzing in swift, merry swirls, or jumping on and
    </p>
    <p>
     off sunny rocks in quick dashes like wave embroidery on seashore cliffs. How
    </p>
    <p>
     true and substantial is this shadow beauty, and with what sublime
    </p>
    <p>
     extravagance is beauty thus multiplied! The big orange lilies are now arrayed in
    </p>
    <p>
     all their glory of leaf and flower. Noble plants, in perfect health, Nature's
    </p>
    <p>
     darlings.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Some of the silly sheep got caught fast in a tangle of chaparral this
    </p>
    <p>
     morning, like flies in a spider's web, and had to be helped out. Carlo found
    </p>
    <p>
     them and tried to drive them from the trap by the easiest way. How far above
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep are intelligent dogs! No friend and helper can be more affectionate and
    </p>
    <p>
     constant than Carlo. The noble St. Bernard is an honor to his race.
    </p>
    <p>
     The air is distinctly fragrant with balsam and resin and mint,—every breath of
    </p>
    <p>
     it a gift we may well thank God for. Who could ever guess that so rough a
    </p>
    <p>
     wilderness should yet be so fine, so full of good things. One seems to be in a
    </p>
    <p>
     majestic domed pavilion in which a grand play is being acted with scenery and
    </p>
    <p>
     music and incense,—all the furniture and action so interesting we are in no
    </p>
    <p>
     danger of being called on to endure one dull moment. God himself seems to be
    </p>
    <p>
     always doing his best here, working like a man in a glow of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Sauntered along the river-bank to my lily gardens. The perfection of
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty in these lilies of the wilderness is a never-ending source of admiration
    </p>
    <p>
     and wonder. Their rhizomes are set in black mould accumulated in hollows of
    </p>
    <p>
     the metamorphic slates beside the pools, where they are well watered without
    </p>
    <p>
     being subjected to flood action. Every leaf in the level whorls around the tall
    </p>
    <p>
     polished stalks is as finely finished as the petals, and the light and heat
    </p>
    <p>
     required are measured for them and tempered in passing through the branches
    </p>
    <p>
     of over-leaning trees. However strong the winds from the noon rainstorms,
    </p>
    <p>
     they are securely sheltered. Beautiful hypnum carpets bordered with ferns are
    </p>
    <p>
     spread beneath them, violets too, and a few daisies. Everything around them
    </p>
    <p>
     sweet and fresh like themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cloudland to-day is only a solitary white mountain; but it is so enriched with
    </p>
    <p>
     sunshine and shade, the tones of color on its big domed head and bossy
    </p>
    <p>
     outbulging ridges, and in the hollows and ravines between them, are ineffably
    </p>
    <p>
     fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Unusually cloudy. Besides the periodical shower-bearing cumuli there is
    </p>
    <p>
     a thin, diffused, fog-like cloud overhead. About . in all.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Oh, these vast, calm, measureless mountain days, inciting at once to
    </p>
    <p>
     work and rest! Days in whose light everything seems equally divine, opening a
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand windows to show us God. Nevermore, however weary, should one
    </p>
    <p>
     faint by the way who gains the blessings of one mountain day; whatever his
    </p>
    <p>
     fate, long life, short life, stormy or calm, he is rich forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Our regular allowance of clouds and thunder. Shepherd Billy is in a
    </p>
    <p>
     peck of trouble about the sheep; he declares that they are possessed with more
    </p>
    <p>
     of the evil one than any other flock from the beginning of the invention of
    </p>
    <p>
     mutton and wool to the last batch of it. No matter how many are missing, he
    </p>
    <p>
     will not, he says, go a step to seek them, because, as he reasons, while getting
    </p>
    <p>
     back one wanderer he would probably lose ten. Therefore runaway hunting
    </p>
    <p>
     must be Carlo's and mine. Billy's little dog Jack is also giving trouble by leaving
    </p>
    <p>
     camp every night to visit his neighbors up the mountain at Brown's Flat. He is
    </p>
    <p>
     a common-looking cur of no particular breed, but tremendously enterprising in
    </p>
    <p>
     love and war. He has cut all the ropes and leather straps he has been tied with,
    </p>
    <p>
     until his master in desperation, after climbing the brushy mountain again and
    </p>
    <p>
     again to drag him back, fastened him with a pole attached to his collar under
    </p>
    <p>
     his chin at one end, and to a stout sapling at the other. But the pole gave good
    </p>
    <p>
     leverage, and by constant twisting during the night, the fastening at the sapling
    </p>
    <p>
     end was chafed off, and he set out on his usual journey, dragging the pole
    </p>
    <p>
     through the brush, and reached the Indian settlement in safety. His master
    </p>
    <p>
     followed, and making no allowance, gave him a beating, and swore in bad
    </p>
    <p>
     terms that next evening he would "fix that infatuated pup" by anchoring him
    </p>
    <p>
     unmercifully to the heavy cast-iron lid of our Dutch oven, weighing about as
    </p>
    <p>
     much as the dog. It was linked directly to his collar close up under the chin,
    </p>
    <p>
     so that the poor fellow seemed unable to stir. He stood quite discouraged until
    </p>
    <p>
     after dark, unable to look about him, or even to lie down unless he stretched
    </p>
    <p>
     himself out with his front feet across the lid, and his head close down between
    </p>
    <p>
     his paws. Before morning, however, Jack was heard far up the height howling
    </p>
    <p>
     Excelsior, cast-iron anchor to the contrary notwithstanding. He must have
    </p>
    <p>
     walked, or rather climbed, erect on his hind legs, clasping the heavy lid like a
    </p>
    <p>
     shield against his breast, a formidable iron-clad condition in which to meet his
    </p>
    <p>
     rivals. Next night, dog, pot-lid, and all, were tied up in an old bean-sack, and
    </p>
    <p>
     thus at last angry Billy gained the victory. Just before leaving home, Jack was
    </p>
    <p>
     bitten in the lower jaw by a rattlesnake, and for a week or so his head and neck
    </p>
    <p>
     were swollen to more than double the normal size; nevertheless he ran about
    </p>
    <p>
     as brisk and lively as ever, and is now completely recovered. The only
    </p>
    <p>
     treatment he got was fresh milk—a gallon or two at a time forcibly poured
    </p>
    <p>
     down his sore, poisoned throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Though only a sheep camp, this grand mountain hollow is home, sweet
    </p>
    <p>
     home, every day growing sweeter, and I shall be sorry to leave it. The lily
    </p>
    <p>
     gardens are safe as yet from the trampling flock. Poor, dusty, raggedy,
    </p>
    <p>
     famishing creatures, I heartily pity them. Many a mile they must go every day
    </p>
    <p>
     to gather their fifteen or twenty tons of chaparral and grass.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Nuttall's flowering dogwood makes a fine show when in bloom. The
    </p>
    <p>
     whole tree is then snowy white. The involucres are six to eight inches wide.
    </p>
    <p>
     Along the streams it is a good-sized tree thirty to fifty feet high, with a broad
    </p>
    <p>
     head when not crowded by companions. Its showy involucres attract a crowd of
    </p>
    <p>
     moths, butterflies, and other winged people about it for their own and, I
    </p>
    <p>
     suppose, the tree's advantage. It likes plenty of cool water, and is a great
    </p>
    <p>
     drinker like the alder, willow, and cottonwood, and flourishes best on stream
    </p>
    <p>
     banks, though it often wanders far from streams in damp shady glens beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     the pines, where it is much smaller. When the leaves ripen in the fall, they
    </p>
    <p>
     become more beautiful than the flowers, displaying charming tones of red,
    </p>
    <p>
     purple, and lavender. Another species grows in abundance as a chaparral
    </p>
    <p>
     shrub on the shady sides of the hills, probably Cornus sessilis. The leaves are
    </p>
    <p>
     eaten by the sheep.—Heard a few lightning strokes in the distance, with
    </p>
    <p>
     rumbling, mumbling reverberations.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . The beaked hazel Corylus rostrata, var. Californica is common on cool
    </p>
    <p>
     slopes up toward the summit of the Pilot Peak Ridge. There is something
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiarly attractive in the hazel, like the oaks and heaths of the cool countries
    </p>
    <p>
     of our forefathers, and through them our love for these plants has, I suppose,
    </p>
    <p>
     been transmitted. This species is four or five feet high, leaves soft and hairy,
    </p>
    <p>
     grateful to the touch, and the delicious nuts are eagerly gathered by Indians
    </p>
    <p>
     and squirrels. The sky as usual adorned with white noon clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Warm, mellow summer. The glowing sunbeams make every nerve tingle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new needles of the pines and firs are nearly full grown and shine
    </p>
    <p>
     gloriously. Lizards are glinting about on the hot rocks; some that live near the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp are more than half tame. They seem attentive to every movement on our
    </p>
    <p>
     part, as if curious to simply look on without suspicion of harm, turning their
    </p>
    <p>
     heads to look back, and making a variety of pretty gestures. Gentle, guileless
    </p>
    <p>
     creatures with beautiful eyes, I shall be sorry to leave them when we leave
    </p>
    <p>
     camp.

    <p>
     June . I have been making the acquaintance of a very interesting little bird that
    </p>
    <p>
     flits about the falls and rapids of the main branches of the river. It is not a
    </p>
    <p>
     water-bird in structure, though it gets its living in the water, and never leaves
    </p>
    <p>
     the streams. It is not web-footed, yet it dives fearlessly into deep swirling
    </p>
    <p>
     rapids, evidently to feed at the bottom, using its wings to swim with under
    </p>
    <p>
     water just as ducks and loons do. Sometimes it wades about in shallow places,
    </p>
    <p>
     thrusting its head under from time to time in a jerking, nodding, frisky way
    </p>
    <p>
     that is sure to attract attention. It is about the size of a robin, has short crisp
    </p>
    <p>
     wings serviceable for flying either in water or air, and a tail of moderate size
    </p>
    <p>
     slanted upward, giving it, with its nodding, bobbing manners, a wrennish look.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its color is plain bluish ash, with a tinge of brown on the head and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     It flies from fall to fall, rapid to rapid, with a solid whir of wing-beats like those
    </p>
    <p>
     of a quail, follows the windings of the stream, and usually alights on some rock
    </p>
    <p>
     jutting up out of the current, or on some stranded snag, or rarely on the dry
    </p>
    <p>
     limb of an overhanging tree, perching like regular tree birds when it suits its
    </p>
    <p>
     convenience. It has the oddest, daintiest mincing manners imaginable; and the
    </p>
    <p>
     little fellow can sing too, a sweet, thrushy, fluty song, rather low, not the least
    </p>
    <p>
     boisterous, and much less keen and accentuated than from its vigorous
    </p>
    <p>
     briskness one would be led to look for. What a romantic life this little bird
    </p>
    <p>
     leads on the most beautiful portions of the streams, in a genial climate with
    </p>
    <p>
     shade and cool water and spray to temper the summer heat. No wonder it is a
    </p>
    <p>
     fine singer, considering the stream songs it hears day and night. Every breath
    </p>
    <p>
     the little poet draws is part of a song, for all the air about the rapids and falls is
    </p>
    <p>
     beaten into music, and its first lessons must begin before it is born by the
    </p>
    <p>
     thrilling and quivering of the eggs in unison with the tones of the falls. I have
    </p>
    <p>
     not yet found its nest, but it must be near the streams, for it never leaves
    </p>
    <p>
     them.
    </p>
    <p>
     June . Half cloudy, half sunny, clouds lustrous white. The tall pines crowded
    </p>
    <p>
     along the top of the Pilot Peak Ridge look like six-inch miniatures exquisitely
    </p>
    <p>
     outlined on the satiny sky. Average cloudiness for the day about .. No rain. And
    </p>
    <p>
     so this memorable month ends, a stream of beauty unmeasured, no more to be
    </p>
    <p>
     sectioned off by almanac arithmetic than sun-radiance or the currents of seas
    </p>
    <p>
     and rivers—a peaceful, joyful stream of beauty. Every morning, arising from the
    </p>
    <p>
     death of sleep, the happy plants and all our fellow animal creatures great and
    </p>
    <p>
     small, and even the rocks, seemed to be shouting, "Awake, awake, rejoice,
    </p>
    <p>
     rejoice, come love us and join in our song. Come! Come!" Looking back
    </p>
    <p>
     through the stillness and romantic enchanting beauty and peace of the camp
    </p>
    <p>
     grove, this June seems the greatest of all the months of my life, the most truly,
    </p>
    <p>
     divinely free, boundless like eternity, immortal. Everything in it seems equally
    </p>
    <p>
     divine—one smooth, pure, wild glow of Heaven's love, never to be blotted or
    </p>
    <p>
     blurred by anything past or to come.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Summer is ripe. Flocks of seeds are already out of their cups and pods
    </p>
    <p>
     seeking their predestined places. Some will strike root and grow up beside their
    </p>
    <p>
     parents, others flying on the wings of the wind far from them, among strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of the young birds are full feathered and out of their nests, though still
    </p>
    <p>
     looked after by both father and mother, protected and fed and to some extent
    </p>
    <p>
     educated. How beautiful the home life of birds! No wonder we all love them.
    </p>
    <p>
     DOUGLAS SQUIRREL OBSERVING BROTHER MAN
    </p>
    <p>
     I like to watch the squirrels. There are two species here, the large California
    </p>
    <p>
     gray and the Douglas. The latter is the brightest of all the squirrels I have ever
    </p>
    <p>
     seen, a hot spark of life, making every tree tingle with his prickly toes, a
    </p>
    <p>
     condensed nugget of fresh mountain vigor and valor, as free from disease as a
    </p>
    <p>
     sunbeam. One cannot think of such an animal ever being weary or sick. He
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to think the mountains belong to him, and at first tried to drive away
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole flock of sheep as well as the shepherd and dogs. How he scolds, and
    </p>
    <p>
     what faces he makes, all eyes, teeth, and whiskers! If not so comically small, he
    </p>
    <p>
     would indeed be a dreadful fellow. I should like to know more about his
    </p>
    <p>
     bringing up, his life in the home knot-hole, as well as in the tree-tops,
    </p>
    <p>
     throughout all seasons. Strange that I have not yet found a nest full of young
    </p>
    <p>
     ones. The Douglas is nearly allied to the red squirrel of the Atlantic slope, and
    </p>
    <p>
     may have been distributed to this side of the continent by way of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     unbroken forests of the north.
    </p>
    <p>
     The California gray is one of the most beautiful, and, next to the Douglas, the
    </p>
    <p>
     most interesting of our hairy neighbors. Compared with the Douglas he is twice
    </p>
    <p>
     as large, but far less lively and influential as a worker in the woods and he
    </p>
    <p>
     manages to make his way through leaves and branches with less stir than his
    </p>
    <p>
     small brother. I have never heard him bark at anything except our dogs. When
    </p>
    <p>
     in search of food he glides silently from branch to branch, examining last year's
    </p>
    <p>
     cones, to see whether some few seeds may not be left between the scales, or
    </p>
    <p>
     gleans fallen ones among the leaves on the ground, since none of the present
    </p>
    <p>
     season's crop is yet available. His tail floats now behind him, now above him,
    </p>
    <p>
     level or gracefully curled like a wisp of cirrus cloud, every hair in its place,
    </p>
    <p>
     clean and shining and radiant as thistle-down in spite of rough, gummy work.
    </p>
    <p>
     His whole body seems about as unsubstantial as his tail. The little Douglas is
    </p>
    <p>
     fiery, peppery, full of brag and fight and show, with movements so quick and
    </p>
    <p>
     keen they almost sting the onlooker, and the harlequin gyrating show he
    </p>
    <p>
     makes of himself turns one giddy to see. The gray is shy, and oftentimes
    </p>
    <p>
     stealthy in his movements, as if half expecting an enemy in every tree and
    </p>
    <p>
     bush, and back of every log, wishing only to be let alone apparently, and
    </p>
    <p>
     manifesting no desire to be seen or admired or feared. The Indians hunt this
    </p>
    <p>
     species for food, a good cause for caution, not to mention other enemies—
    </p>
    <p>
     hawks, snakes, wild cats. In woods where food is abundant they wear paths
    </p>
    <p>
     through sheltering thickets and over prostrate trees to some favorite pool where
    </p>
    <p>
     in hot and dry weather they drink at nearly the same hour every day. These
    </p>
    <p>
     pools are said to be narrowly watched, especially by the boys, who lie in
    </p>
    <p>
     ambush with bow and arrow, and kill without noise. But, in spite of enemies,
    </p>
    <p>
     squirrels are happy fellows, forest favorites, types of tireless life. Of all Nature's
    </p>
    <p>
     wild beasts, they seem to me the wildest. May we come to know each other
    </p>
    <p>
     better.
    </p>
    <p>
     The chaparral-covered hill-slope to the south of the camp, besides furnishing
    </p>
    <p>
     nesting-places for countless merry birds, is the home and hiding-place of the
    </p>
    <p>
     curious wood rat Neotoma, a handsome, interesting animal, always attracting
    </p>
    <p>
     attention wherever seen. It is more like a squirrel than a rat, is much larger,
    </p>
    <p>
     has delicate, thick, soft fur of a bluish slate color, white on the belly; ears large,
    </p>
    <p>
     thin, and translucent; eyes soft, full, and liquid; claws slender, sharp as
    </p>
    <p>
     needles; and as his limbs are strong, he can climb about as well as a squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
     No rat or squirrel has so innocent a look, is so easily approached, or expresses
    </p>
    <p>
     such confidence in one's good intentions. He seems too fine for the thorny
    </p>
    <p>
     thickets he inhabits, and his hut also is as unlike himself as may be, though
    </p>
    <p>
     softly furnished inside. No other animal inhabitant of these mountains builds
    </p>
    <p>
     houses so large and striking in appearance. The traveler coming suddenly upon
    </p>
    <p>
     a group of them for the first time will not be likely to forget them. They are built
    </p>
    <p>
     of all kinds of sticks, old rotten pieces picked up anywhere, and green prickly
    </p>
    <p>
     twigs bitten from the nearest bushes, the whole mixed with miscellaneous odds
    </p>
    <p>
     and ends of everything movable, such as bits of cloddy earth, stones, bones,
    </p>
    <p>
     deerhorn, etc., piled up in a conical mass as if it were got ready for burning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of these curious cabins are six feet high and as wide at the base, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     dozen or more of them are occasionally grouped together, less perhaps for the
    </p>
    <p>
     sake of society than for advantages of food and shelter. Coming through the
    </p>
    <p>
     dense shaggy thickets of some lonely hillside, the solitary explorer happening
    </p>
    <p>
     into one of these strange villages is startled at the sight, and may fancy himself
    </p>
    <p>
     in an Indian settlement, and begin to wonder what kind of reception he is likely
    </p>
    <p>
     to get. But no savage face will he see, perhaps not a single inhabitant, or at
    </p>
    <p>
     most two or three seated on top of their wigwams, looking at the stranger with
    </p>
    <p>
     the mildest of wild eyes, and allowing a near approach. In the centre of the
    </p>
    <p>
     rough spiky hut a soft nest is made of the inner fibres of bark chewed to tow,
    </p>
    <p>
     and lined with feathers and the down of various seeds, such as willow and
    </p>
    <p>
     milkweed. The delicate creature in its prickly, thick-walled home suggests a
    </p>
    <p>
     tender flower in a thorny involucre. Some of the nests are built in trees thirty
    </p>
    <p>
     or forty feet from the ground, and even in garrets, as if seeking the company
    </p>
    <p>
     and protection of man, like swallows and linnets, though accustomed to the
    </p>
    <p>
     wildest solitude. Among housekeepers Neotoma has the reputation of a thief,
    </p>
    <p>
     because he carries away everything transportable to his queer hut,—knives,
    </p>
    <p>
     forks, combs, nails, tin cups, spectacles, etc.,—merely, however, to strengthen
    </p>
    <p>
     his fortifications, I guess. His food at home, as far as I have learned, is nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     the same as that of the squirrels,—nuts, berries, seeds, and sometimes the
    </p>
    <p>
     bark and tender shoots of the various species of ceanothus.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Warm, sunny day, thrilling plant and animals and rocks alike, making
    </p>
    <p>
     sap and blood flow fast, and making every particle of the crystal mountains
    </p>
    <p>
     throb and swirl and dance in glad accord like star-dust. No dullness anywhere
    </p>
    <p>
     visible or thinkable. No stagnation, no death. Everything kept in joyful
    </p>
    <p>
     rhythmic motion in the pulses of Nature's big heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pearl cumuli over the higher mountains—clouds, not with a silver lining, but
    </p>
    <p>
     all silver. The brightest, crispest, rockiest-looking clouds, most varied in
    </p>
    <p>
     features and keenest in outline I ever saw at any time of year in any country.
    </p>
    <p>
     The daily building and unbuilding of these snowy cloud-ranges—the highest
    </p>
    <p>
     Sierra—is a prime marvel to me, and I gaze at the stupendous white domes,
    </p>
    <p>
     miles high, with ever fresh admiration. But in the midst of these sky and
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain affairs a change of diet is pulling us down. We have been out of
    </p>
    <p>
     bread a few days, and begin to miss it more than seems reason able for we
    </p>
    <p>
     have plenty of meat and sugar and tea. Strange we should feel food-poor in so
    </p>
    <p>
     rich a wilderness. The Indians put us to shame, so do the squirrels,—starchy
    </p>
    <p>
     roots and seeds and bark in abundance, yet the failure of the meal sack
    </p>
    <p>
     disturbs our bodily balance, and threatens our best enjoyments.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Warm. Breeze just enough to sift through the woods and waft fragrance
    </p>
    <p>
     from their thousand fountains. The pine and fir cones are growing well, resin
    </p>
    <p>
     and balsam dripping from every tree, and seeds are ripening fast, promising a
    </p>
    <p>
     fine harvest. The squirrels will have bread. They eat all kinds of nuts long
    </p>
    <p>
     before they are ripe, and yet never seem to suffer in stomach.

     CHAPTER III
    </head>
    <p>
     A BREAD FAMINE
    </p>
    <p>
     July . The air beyond the flock range, full of the essences of the woods, is
    </p>
    <p>
     growing sweeter and more fragrant from day to day, like ripening fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Delaney is expected to arrive soon from the lowlands with a new stock of
    </p>
    <p>
     provisions, and as the flock is to be moved to fresh pastures we shall all be well
    </p>
    <p>
     fed. In the mean time our stock of beans as well as flour has failed—everything
    </p>
    <p>
     but mutton, sugar, and tea. The shepherd is somewhat demoralized, and
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to care but little what becomes of his flock. He says that since the boss
    </p>
    <p>
     has failed to feed him he is not rightly bound to feed the sheep, and swears
    </p>
    <p>
     that no decent white man can climb these steep mountains on mutton alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's not fittin' grub for a white man really white. For dogs and coyotes and
    </p>
    <p>
     Indians it's different. Good grub, good sheep. That's what I say." Such was
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy's Fourth of July oration.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . The clouds of noon on the high Sierra seem yet more marvelously,
    </p>
    <p>
     indescribably beautiful from day to day as one becomes more wakeful to see
    </p>
    <p>
     them. The smoke of the gunpowder burned yesterday on the lowlands, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     eloquence of the orators has probably settled or been blown away by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here every day is a holiday, a jubilee ever sounding with serene enthusiasm,
    </p>
    <p>
     without wear or waste or cloying weariness. Everything rejoicing. Not a single
    </p>
    <p>
     cell or crystal unvisited or forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Mr. Delaney has not arrived, and the bread famine is sore. We must eat
    </p>
    <p>
     mutton a while longer, though it seems hard to get accustomed to it. I have
    </p>
    <p>
     heard of Texas pioneers living without bread or anything made from the cereals
    </p>
    <p>
     for months without suffering, using the breast-meat of wild turkeys for bread.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of this kind they had plenty in the good old days when life, though considered
    </p>
    <p>
     less safe, was fussed over the less. The trappers and fur traders of early days in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Rocky Mountain regions lived on bison and beaver meat for months.
    </p>
    <p>
     Salmon-eaters, too, there are among both Indians and whites who seem to
    </p>
    <p>
     suffer little or not at all from the want of bread. Just at this moment mutton
    </p>
    <p>
     seems the least desirable of food, though of good quality. We pick out the
    </p>
    <p>
     leanest bits, and down they go against heavy disgust, causing nausea and an
    </p>
    <p>
     effort to reject the offensive stuff. Tea makes matters worse, if possible. The
    </p>
    <p>
     stomach begins to assert itself as an independent creature with a will of its
    </p>
    <p>
     own. We should boil lupine leaves, clover, starchy petioles, and saxifrage
    </p>
    <p>
     rootstocks like the Indians. We try to ignore our gastric troubles, rise and gaze
    </p>
    <p>
     about us, turn our eyes to the mountains, and climb doggedly up through
    </p>
    <p>
     brush and rocks into the heart of the scenery. A stifled calm comes on, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     day's duties and even enjoyments are languidly got through with. We chew a
    </p>
    <p>
     few leaves of ceanothus by way of luncheon, and smell or chew the spicy
    </p>
    <p>
     monardella for the dull headache and stomach-ache that now lightens, now
    </p>
    <p>
     comes muffling down upon us and into us like fog. At night more mutton, flesh
    </p>
    <p>
     to flesh, down with it, not too much, and there are the stars shining through
    </p>
    <p>
     the cedar plumes and branches above our beds.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Rather weak and sickish this morning, and all about a piece of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
     Can scarce command attention to my best studies, as if one couldn't take a few
    </p>
    <p>
     days' saunter in the Godful woods without maintaining a base on a wheat-field
    </p>
    <p>
     and gristmill. Like caged parrots we want a cracker, any of the hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     kinds—the remainder biscuit of a voyage around the world would answer well
    </p>
    <p>
     enough, nor would the wholesomeness of saleratus biscuit be questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bread without flesh is a good diet, as on many botanical excursions I have
    </p>
    <p>
     proved. Tea also may easily be ignored. Just bread and water and delightful toil
    </p>
    <p>
     is all I need,—not unreasonably much, yet one ought to be trained and
    </p>
    <p>
     tempered to enjoy life in these brave wilds in full independence of any
    </p>
    <p>
     particular kind of nourishment. That this may be accomplished is manifest, as
    </p>
    <p>
     far as bodily welfare is concerned, in the lives of people of other climes. The
    </p>
    <p>
     Eskimo, for example, gets a living far north of the wheat line, from oily seals
    </p>
    <p>
     and whales. Meat, berries, bitter weeds, and blubber, or only the last, for
    </p>
    <p>
     months at a time; and yet these people all around the frozen shores of our
    </p>
    <p>
     continent are said to be hearty, jolly, stout, and brave. We hear, too, of fisheaters, carnivorous as spiders, yet well enough as far as stomachs are
    </p>
    <p>
     concerned, while we are so ridiculously helpless, making wry faces over our
    </p>
    <p>
     fare, looking sheepish in digestive distress amid rumbling, grumbling sounds
    </p>
    <p>
     that might well pass for smothered baas. We have a large supply of sugar, and
    </p>
    <p>
     this evening it occurred to me that these belligerent stomachs might possibly,
    </p>
    <p>
     like complaining children, be coaxed with candy. Accordingly the frying-pan
    </p>
    <p>
     was cleansed, and a lot of sugar cooked in it to a sort of wax, but this stuff only
    </p>
    <p>
     made matters worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Man seems to be the only animal whose food soils him, making necessary
    </p>
    <p>
     much washing and shield-like bibs and napkins. Moles living in the earth and
    </p>
    <p>
     eating slimy worms are yet as clean as seals or fishes, whose lives are one
    </p>
    <p>
     perpetual wash. And, as we have seen, the squirrels in these resiny woods keep
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves clean in some mysterious way; not a hair is sticky, though they
    </p>
    <p>
     handle the gummy cones, and glide about apparently without care. The birds,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, are clean, though they seem to make a good deal of fuss washing and
    </p>
    <p>
     cleaning their feathers. Certain flies and ants I see are in a fix, entangled and
    </p>
    <p>
     sealed up in the sugar-wax we threw away, like some of their ancestors in
    </p>
    <p>
     amber. Our stomachs, like tired muscles, are sore with long squirming. Once I
    </p>
    <p>
     was very hungry in the Bonaventure graveyard near Savannah, Georgia, having
    </p>
    <p>
     fasted for several days; then the empty stomach seemed to chafe in much the
    </p>
    <p>
     same way as now, and a somewhat similar tenderness and aching was
    </p>
    <p>
     produced, hard to bear, though the pain was not acute. We dream of bread, a
    </p>
    <p>
     sure sign we need it. Like the Indians, we ought to know how to get the starch
    </p>
    <p>
     out of fern and saxifrage stalks, lily bulbs, pine bark, etc. Our education has
    </p>
    <p>
     been sadly neglected for many generations. Wild rice would be good. I noticed a
    </p>
    <p>
     leersia in wet meadow edges, but the seeds are small. Acorns are not ripe, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     pine nuts, nor filberts. The inner bark of pine or spruce might be tried. Drank
    </p>
    <p>
     tea until half intoxicated. Man seems to crave a stimulant when anything
    </p>
    <p>
     extraordinary is going on, and this is the only one I use. Billy chews great
    </p>
    <p>
     quantities of tobacco, which I suppose helps to stupefy and moderate his
    </p>
    <p>
     misery. We look and listen for the Don every hour. How beautiful upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains his big feet would be!
    </p>
    <p>
     In the warm, hospitable Sierra, shepherds and mountain men in general, as far
    </p>
    <p>
     as I have seen, are easily satisfied as to food supplies and bedding. Most of
    </p>
    <p>
     them are heartily content to "rough it," ignoring Nature's fineness as
    </p>
    <p>
     bothersome or unmanly. The shepherd's bed is often only the bare ground and
    </p>
    <p>
     a pair of blankets, with a stone, a piece of wood, or a pack-saddle for a pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
     In choosing the spot, he shows less care than the dogs, for they usually
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberate before making up their minds in so important an affair, going from
    </p>
    <p>
     place to place, scraping away loose sticks and pebbles, and trying for comfort
    </p>
    <p>
     by making many changes, while the shepherd casts himself down anywhere,
    </p>
    <p>
     seemingly the least skilled of all rest seekers. His food, too, even when he has
    </p>
    <p>
     all he wants, is usually far from delicate, either in kind or cooking. Beans,
    </p>
    <p>
     bread of any sort, bacon, mutton, dried peaches, and sometimes potatoes and
    </p>
    <p>
     onions, make up his bill-of-fare, the two latter articles being regarded as
    </p>
    <p>
     luxuries on account of their weight as compared with the nourishment they
    </p>
    <p>
     contain; a half-sack or so of each may be put into the pack in setting out from
    </p>
    <p>
     the home ranch and in a few days they are done. Beans are the main standby,
    </p>
    <p>
     portable, wholesome, and capable of going far, besides being easily cooked,
    </p>
    <p>
     although curiously enough a great deal of mystery is supposed to lie about the
    </p>
    <p>
     bean-pot. No two cooks quite agree on the methods of making beans do their
    </p>
    <p>
     best, and, after petting and coaxing and nursing the savory mess,—well oiled
    </p>
    <p>
     and mellowed with bacon boiled into the heart of it,—the proud cook will ask,
    </p>
    <p>
     after dishing out a quart or two for trial, "Well, how do you like my beans?" as if
    </p>
    <p>
     by no possibility could they be like any other beans cooked in the same way,
    </p>
    <p>
     but must needs possess some special virtue of which he alone is master.
    </p>
    <p>
     Molasses, sugar, or pepper may be used to give desired flavors; or the first
    </p>
    <p>
     water may be poured off and a spoonful or two of ashes or soda added to
    </p>
    <p>
     dissolve or soften the skins more fully, according to various tastes and notions.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, like casks of wine, no two potfuls are exactly alike to every palate. Some
    </p>
    <p>
     are supposed to be spoiled by the moon, by some unlucky day, by the beans
    </p>
    <p>
     having been grown on soil not suitable; or the whole year may be to blame as
    </p>
    <p>
     not favorable for beans.
    </p>
    <p>
     Coffee, too, has its marvels in the camp kitchen, but not so many, and not so
    </p>
    <p>
     inscrutable as those that beset the bean-pot. A low, complacent grunt follows a
    </p>
    <p>
     mouthful drawn in with a gurgle, and the remark cast forth aimlessly, "That's
    </p>
    <p>
     good coffee." Then another gurgling sip and repetition of the judgment, "Yes,
    </p>
    <p>
     sir, that is good coffee." As to tea, there are but two kinds, weak and strong,
    </p>
    <p>
     the stronger the better. The only remark heard is, "That tea's weak," otherwise
    </p>
    <p>
     it is good enough and not worth mentioning. If it has been boiled an hour or
    </p>
    <p>
     two or smoked on a pitchy fire, no matter,—who cares for a little tannin or
    </p>
    <p>
     creosote? they make the black beverage all the stronger and more attractive to
    </p>
    <p>
     tobacco-tanned palates.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sheep-camp bread, like most California camp bread, is baked in Dutch ovens,
    </p>
    <p>
     some of it in the form of yeast powder biscuit, an unwholesome sticky
    </p>
    <p>
     compound leading straight to dyspepsia. The greater part, however, is
    </p>
    <p>
     fermented with sour dough, a handful from each batch being saved and put
    </p>
    <p>
     away in the mouth of the flour sack to inoculate the next. The oven is simply a
    </p>
    <p>
     cast-iron pot, about five inches deep and from twelve to eighteen inches wide.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the batch has been mixed and kneaded in a tin pan the oven is slightly
    </p>
    <p>
     heated and rubbed with a piece of tallow or pork rind. The dough is then
    </p>
    <p>
     placed in it, pressed out against the sides, and left to rise. When ready for
    </p>
    <p>
     baking a shovelful of coals is spread out by the side of the fire and the oven set
    </p>
    <p>
     upon them, while another shovelful is placed on top of the lid, which is raised
    </p>
    <p>
     from time to time to see that the requisite amount of heat is being kept up.
    </p>
    <p>
     With care good bread may be made in this way, though it is liable to be burned
    </p>
    <p>
     or to be sour, or raised too much, and the weight of the oven is a serious
    </p>
    <p>
     objection.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last Don Delaney comes doon the lang glen—hunger vanishes, we turn our
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes to the mountains, and to-morrow we go climbing toward cloudland.
    </p>
    <p>
     Never while anything is left of me shall this first camp be forgotten. It has fairly
    </p>
    <p>
     grown into me, not merely as memory pictures, but as part and parcel of mind
    </p>
    <p>
     and body alike. The deep hopper-like hollow, with its majestic trees through
    </p>
    <p>
     which all the wonderful nights the stars poured their beauty. The flowery
    </p>
    <p>
     wildness of the high steep slope toward Brown's Flat, and its bloom-fragrance
    </p>
    <p>
     descending at the close of the still days. The embowered river-reaches with
    </p>
    <p>
     their multitude of voices making melody, the stately flow and rush and glad
    </p>
    <p>
     exulting onsweeping currents caressing the dipping sedge-leaves and bushes
    </p>
    <p>
     and mossy stones, swirling in pools, dividing against little flowery islands,
    </p>
    <p>
     breaking gray and white here and there, ever rejoicing, yet with deep solemn
    </p>
    <p>
     undertones recalling the ocean—the brave little bird ever beside them, singing
    </p>
    <p>
     with sweet human tones among the waltzing foam-bells, and like a blessed
    </p>
    <p>
     evangel explaining God's love. And the Pilot Peak Ridge, its long withdrawing
    </p>
    <p>
     slopes gracefully modeled and braided, reaching from climate to climate,
    </p>
    <p>
     feathered with trees that are the kings of their race, their ranks nobly
    </p>
    <p>
     marshaled to view, spire above spire, crown above crown, waving their long,
    </p>
    <p>
     leafy arms, tossing their cones like ringing bells—blessed sun-fed
    </p>
    <p>
     mountaineers rejoicing in their strength, every tree tuneful, a harp for the
    </p>
    <p>
     winds and the sun. The hazel and buckthorn pastures of the deer, the sunbeaten brows purple and yellow with mint and golden-rods, carpeted with
    </p>
    <p>
     chamæbatia, humming with bees. And the dawns and sunrises and sundowns
    </p>
    <p>
     of these mountain days,—the rose light creeping higher among the stars,
    </p>
    <p>
     changing to daffodil yellow, the level beams bursting forth, streaming across
    </p>
    <p>
     the ridges, touching pine after pine, awakening and warming all the mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     host to do gladly their shining day's work. The great sun-gold noons, the
    </p>
    <p>
     alabaster cloud-mountains, the landscape beaming with consciousness like the
    </p>
    <p>
     face of a god. The sunsets, when the trees stood hushed awaiting their goodnight blessings. Divine, enduring, unwastable wealth.

     CHAPTER IV
    </head>
    <p>
     TO THE HIGH MOUNTAINS
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Now away we go toward the topmost mountains. Many still, small voices,
    </p>
    <p>
     as well as the noon thunder, are calling, "Come higher." Farewell, blessed dell,
    </p>
    <p>
     woods, gardens, streams, birds, squirrels, lizards, and a thousand others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Farewell. Farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Up through the woods the hoofed locusts streamed beneath a cloud of brown
    </p>
    <p>
     dust. Scarcely were they driven a hundred yards from the old corral ere they
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to know that at last they were going to new pastures, and rushed wildly
    </p>
    <p>
     ahead, crowding through gaps in the brush, jumping, tumbling like exulting
    </p>
    <p>
     hurrahing flood-waters escaping through a broken dam. A man on each flank
    </p>
    <p>
     kept shouting advice to the leaders, who in their famishing condition were
    </p>
    <p>
     behaving like Gadarene swine; two other drivers were busy with stragglers,
    </p>
    <p>
     helping them out of brush tangles; the Indian, calm, alert, silently watched for
    </p>
    <p>
     wanderers likely to be overlooked; the two dogs ran here and there, at a loss to
    </p>
    <p>
     know what was best to be done, while the Don, soon far in the rear, was trying
    </p>
    <p>
     to keep in sight of his troublesome wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
     DIVIDE BETWEEN THE TUOLUMNE AND THE MERCED BELOW HAZEL
    </p>
    <p>
     GREEN
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as the boundary of the old eaten-out range was passed the hungry
    </p>
    <p>
     horde suddenly became calm, like a mountain stream in a meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thenceforward they were allowed to eat their way as slowly as they wished,
    </p>
    <p>
     care being taken only to keep them headed toward the summit of the Merced
    </p>
    <p>
     and Tuolumne divide. Soon the two thousand flattened paunches were bulged
    </p>
    <p>
     out with sweet-pea vines and grass, and the gaunt, desperate creatures, more
    </p>
    <p>
     like wolves than sheep, became bland and governable, while the howling
    </p>
    <p>
     drivers changed to gentle shepherds, and sauntered in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Toward sundown we reached Hazel Green, a charming spot on the summit of
    </p>
    <p>
     the dividing ridge between the basins of the Merced and Tuolumne, where there
    </p>
    <p>
     is a small brook flowing through hazel and dogwood thickets beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificent silver firs and pines. Here, we are camped for the night, our big
    </p>
    <p>
     fire, heaped high with rosiny logs and branches, is blazing like a sunrise, gladly
    </p>
    <p>
     giving back the light slowly sifted from the sunbeams of centuries of summers;
    </p>
    <p>
     and in the glow of that old sunlight how impressively surrounding objects are
    </p>
    <p>
     brought forward in relief against the outer darkness! Grasses, larkspurs,
    </p>
    <p>
     columbines, lilies, hazel bushes, and the great trees form a circle around the
    </p>
    <p>
     fire like thoughtful spectators, gazing and listening with human-like
    </p>
    <p>
     enthusiasm. The night breeze is cool, for all day we have been climbing into the
    </p>
    <p>
     upper sky, the home of the cloud mountains we so long have admired. How
    </p>
    <p>
     sweet and keen the air! Every breath a blessing. Here the sugar pine reaches
    </p>
    <p>
     its fullest development in size and beauty and number of individuals, filling
    </p>
    <p>
     every swell and hollow and down-plunging ravine almost to the exclusion of
    </p>
    <p>
     other species. A few yellow pines are still to be found as companions, and in
    </p>
    <p>
     the coolest places silver firs; but noble as these are, the sugar pine is king, and
    </p>
    <p>
     spreads long protecting arms above them while they rock and wave in sign of
    </p>
    <p>
     recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
     We have now reached a height of six thousand feet. In the forenoon we passed
    </p>
    <p>
     along a flat part of the dividing ridge that is planted with manzanita
    </p>
    <p>
     Arctostaphylos, some specimens the largest I have seen. I measured one, the
    </p>
    <p>
     bole of which is four feet in diameter and only eighteen inches high from the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground, where it dissolves into many wide-spreading branches forming a broad
    </p>
    <p>
     round head about ten or twelve feet high, covered with clusters of small
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow-throated pink bells. The leaves are pale green, glandular, and set on
    </p>
    <p>
     edge by a twist of the petiole. The branches seem naked; for the chocolatecolored bark is very smooth and thin, and is shed off in flakes that curl when
    </p>
    <p>
     dry. The wood is red, close-grained, hard, and heavy. I wonder how old these
    </p>
    <p>
     curious tree-bushes are, probably as old as the great pines. Indians and bears
    </p>
    <p>
     and birds and fat grubs feast on the berries, which look like small apples, often
    </p>
    <p>
     rosy on one side, green on the other. The Indians are said to make a kind of
    </p>
    <p>
     beer or cider out of them. There are many species. This one, Arctostaphylos
    </p>
    <p>
     pungens, is common hereabouts. No need have they to fear the wind, so low
    </p>
    <p>
     they are and steadfastly rooted. Even the fires that sweep the woods seldom
    </p>
    <p>
     destroy them utterly, for they rise again from the root, and some of the dry
    </p>
    <p>
     ridges they grow on are seldom touched by fire. I must try to know them better.
    </p>
    <p>
     I miss my river songs to-night. Here Hazel Creek at its topmost springs has a
    </p>
    <p>
     voice like a bird. The wind-tones in the great trees overhead are strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     impressive, all the more because not a leaf stirs below them. But it grows late,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I must to bed. The camp is silent; everybody asleep. It seems extravagant
    </p>
    <p>
     to spend hours so precious in sleep. "He giveth his beloved sleep." Pity the
    </p>
    <p>
     poor beloved needs it, weak, weary, forspent; oh, the pity of it, to sleep in the
    </p>
    <p>
     midst of eternal, beautiful motion instead of gazing forever, like the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Exhilarated with the mountain air, I feel like shouting this morning with
    </p>
    <p>
     excess of wild animal joy. The Indian lay down away from the fire last night,
    </p>
    <p>
     without blankets, having nothing on, by way of clothing, but a pair of blue
    </p>
    <p>
     overalls and a calico shirt wet with sweat. The night air is chilly at this
    </p>
    <p>
     elevation, and we gave him some horse-blankets, but he didn't seem to care for
    </p>
    <p>
     them. A fine thing to be independent of clothing where it is so hard to carry.
    </p>
    <p>
     When food is scarce, he can live on whatever comes in his way—a few berries,
    </p>
    <p>
     roots, bird eggs, grasshoppers, black ants, fat wasp or bumblebee larvæ,
    </p>
    <p>
     without feeling that he is doing anything worth mention, so I have been told.
    </p>
    <p>
     A Silver Fir, or Red Fir Abies magnifica
    </p>
    <p>
     Our course to-day was along the broad top of the main ridge to a hollow
    </p>
    <p>
     beyond Crane Flat. It is scarce at all rocky, and is covered with the noblest
    </p>
    <p>
     pines and spruces I have yet seen. Sugar pines from six to eight feet in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter are not uncommon, with a height of two hundred feet or even more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silver firs Abies concolor and A. magnifica are ex ceedingly beautiful,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially the magnifica, which becomes more abundant the higher we go. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     of great size, one of the most notable in every way of the giant conifers of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Sierra. I saw specimens that measured seven feet in diameter and over two
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred feet in height, while the average size for what might be called fullgrown mature trees can hardly be less than one hundred and eighty or two
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred feet high and five or six feet in diameter; and with these noble
    </p>
    <p>
     dimensions there is a symmetry and perfection of finish not to be seen in any
    </p>
    <p>
     other tree, hereabout at least. The branches are whorled in fives mostly, and
    </p>
    <p>
     stand out from the tall, straight, exquisitely tapered bole in level collars, each
    </p>
    <p>
     branch regularly pinnated like the fronds of ferns, and densely clad with leaves
    </p>
    <p>
     all around the branchlets, thus giving them a singularly rich and sumptuous
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance. The extreme top of the tree is a thick blunt shoot pointing straight
    </p>
    <p>
     to the zenith like an admonishing finger. The cones stand erect like casks on
    </p>
    <p>
     the upper branches. They are about six inches long, three in diameter, blunt,
    </p>
    <p>
     velvety, and cylindrical in form, and very rich and precious looking. The seeds
    </p>
    <p>
     are about three quarters of an inch long, dark reddish brown with brilliant
    </p>
    <p>
     iridescent purple wings, and when ripe, the cone falls to pieces, and the seeds
    </p>
    <p>
     thus set free at a height of one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet have a
    </p>
    <p>
     good send off and may fly considerable distances in a good breeze; and it is
    </p>
    <p>
     when a good breeze is blowing that most of them are shaken free to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other species, Abies concolor, attains nearly as great a height and
    </p>
    <p>
     thickness as the magnifica, but the branches do not form such regular whorls,
    </p>
    <p>
     nor are they so exactly pinnated or richly leaf-clad. Instead of growing all
    </p>
    <p>
     around the branchlets, the leaves are mostly arranged in two flat horizontal
    </p>
    <p>
     rows. The cones and seeds are like those of the magnifica in form but less than
    </p>
    <p>
     half as large. The bark of the magnifica is reddish purple and closely furrowed,
    </p>
    <p>
     that of the concolor gray and widely furrowed. A noble pair.
    </p>
    <p>
     At Crane Flat we climbed a thousand feet or more in a distance of about two
    </p>
    <p>
     miles, the forest growing more dense and the silvery magnifica fir forming a still
    </p>
    <p>
     greater portion of the whole. Crane Flat is a meadow with a wide sandy border
    </p>
    <p>
     lying on the top of the divide. It is often visited by blue cranes to rest and feed
    </p>
    <p>
     on their long journeys, hence the name. It is about half a mile long, draining
    </p>
    <p>
     into the Merced, sedgy in the middle, with a margin bright with lilies,
    </p>
    <p>
     columbines, lark spurs, lupines, castilleia, then an outer zone of dry, gently
    </p>
    <p>
     sloping ground starred with a multitude of small flowers,—eunanus, mimulus,
    </p>
    <p>
     gilia, with rosettes of spraguea, and tufts of several species of eriogonum and
    </p>
    <p>
     the brilliant zauschneria. The noble forest wall about it is made up of the two
    </p>
    <p>
     silver firs and the yellow and sugar pines, which here seem to reach their
    </p>
    <p>
     highest pitch of beauty and grandeur; for the elevation, six thousand feet or a
    </p>
    <p>
     little more, is not too great for the sugar and yellow pines or too low for the
    </p>
    <p>
     magnifica fir, while the concolor seems to find this elevation the best possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     About a mile from the north end of the flat there is a grove of Sequoia gigantea,
    </p>
    <p>
     the king of all the conifers. Furthermore, the Douglas spruce Pseudotsuga
    </p>
    <p>
     Douglasii and Libocedrus decurrens, and a few two-leaved pines, occur here
    </p>
    <p>
     and there, forming a small part of the forest. Three pines, two silver firs, one
    </p>
    <p>
     Douglas spruce, one sequoia,—all of them, except the two-leaved pine, colossal
    </p>
    <p>
     trees,—are found here together, an assemblage of conifers unrivaled on the
    </p>
    <p>
     globe.
    </p>
    <p>
     We passed a number of charming garden-like meadows lying on top of the
    </p>
    <p>
     divide or hanging like ribbons down its sides, imbedded in the glorious forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some are taken up chiefly with the tall white-flowered Veratrum Californicum,
    </p>
    <p>
     with boat-shaped leaves about a foot long, eight or ten inches wide, and veined
    </p>
    <p>
     like those of cypripedium,—a robust, hearty, liliaceous plant, fond of water and
    </p>
    <p>
     determined to be seen. Columbine and larkspur grow on the dryer edges of the
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows, with a tall handsome lupine standing waist-deep in long grasses and
    </p>
    <p>
     sedges. Castilleias, too, of several species make a bright show with beds of
    </p>
    <p>
     violets at their feet. But the glory of these forest meadows is a lily L. parvum.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tallest are from seven to eight feet high with magnificent racemes of ten to
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty or more small orange-colored flowers; they stand out free in open
    </p>
    <p>
     ground, with just enough grass and other companion plants about them to
    </p>
    <p>
     fringe their feet, and show them off to best advantage. This is a grand addition
    </p>
    <p>
     to my lily acquaintances,—a true mountaineer, reaching prime vigor and
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty at a height of seven thousand feet or thereabouts. It varies, I find, very
    </p>
    <p>
     much in size even in the same meadow, not only with the soil, but with age. I
    </p>
    <p>
     saw a specimen that had only one flower, and another within a stone's throw
    </p>
    <p>
     had twenty-five. And to think that the sheep should be allowed in these lily
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows! after how many centuries of Nature's care planting and watering
    </p>
    <p>
     them, tucking the bulbs in snugly below winter frost, shading the tender
    </p>
    <p>
     shoots with clouds drawn above them like curtains, pouring refreshing rain,
    </p>
    <p>
     making them perfect in beauty, and keeping them safe by a thousand miracles;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet, strange to say, allowing the trampling of devastating sheep. One might
    </p>
    <p>
     reasonably look for a wall of fire to fence such gardens. So extravagant is
    </p>
    <p>
     Nature with her choicest treasures, spending plant beauty as she spends
    </p>
    <p>
     sunshine, pouring it forth into land and sea, garden and desert. And so the
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty of lilies falls on angels and men, bears and squirrels, wolves and sheep,
    </p>
    <p>
     birds and bees, but as far as I have seen, man alone, and the animals he
    </p>
    <p>
     tames, destroy these gardens. Awkward, lumbering bears, the Don tells me,
    </p>
    <p>
     love to wallow in them in hot weather, and deer with their sharp feet cross
    </p>
    <p>
     them again and again, sauntering and feeding, yet never a lily have I seen
    </p>
    <p>
     spoiled by them. Rather, like gardeners, they seem to cultivate them, pressing
    </p>
    <p>
     and dibbling as required. Anyhow not a leaf or petal seems misplaced.
    </p>
    <p>
     The trees round about them seem as perfect in beauty and form as the lilies,
    </p>
    <p>
     their boughs whorled like lily leaves in exact order. This evening, as usual, the
    </p>
    <p>
     glow of our camp-fire is working enchantment on everything within reach of its
    </p>
    <p>
     rays. Lying beneath the firs, it is glorious to see them dipping their spires in
    </p>
    <p>
     the starry sky, the sky like one vast lily meadow in bloom! How can I close my
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes on so precious a night?
    </p>
    <p>
     July . A Douglas squirrel, peppery, pungent autocrat of the woods, is barking
    </p>
    <p>
     overhead this morning, and the small forest birds, so seldom seen when one
    </p>
    <p>
     travels noisily, are out on sunny branches along the edge of the meadow
    </p>
    <p>
     getting warm, taking a sun bath and dew bath—a fine sight. How charming the
    </p>
    <p>
     sprightly confident looks and ways of these little feathered people of the trees!
    </p>
    <p>
     They seem sure of dainty, wholesome breakfasts, and where are so many
    </p>
    <p>
     breakfasts to come from? How helpless should we find ourselves should we try
    </p>
    <p>
     to set a table for them of such buds, seeds, insects, etc., as would keep them in
    </p>
    <p>
     the pure wild health they enjoy! Not a headache or any other ache amongst
    </p>
    <p>
     them, I guess. As for the irrepressible Douglas squirrels, one never thinks of
    </p>
    <p>
     their breakfasts or the possibility of hunger, sickness or death; rather they
    </p>
    <p>
     seem like stars above chance or change, even though we may see them at times
    </p>
    <p>
     busy gathering burrs, working hard for a living.
    </p>
    <p>
     On through the forest ever higher we go, a cloud of dust dimming the way,
    </p>
    <p>
     thousands of feet trampling leaves and flowers, but in this mighty wilderness
    </p>
    <p>
     they seem but a feeble band, and a thousand gardens will escape their
    </p>
    <p>
     blighting touch. They cannot hurt the trees, though some of the seedlings
    </p>
    <p>
     suffer, and should the woolly locusts be greatly multiplied, as on account of
    </p>
    <p>
     dollar value they are likely to be, then the forests, too, may in time be
    </p>
    <p>
     destroyed. Only the sky will then be safe, though hid from view by dust and
    </p>
    <p>
     smoke, incense of a bad sacrifice. Poor, helpless, hungry sheep, in great part
    </p>
    <p>
     misbegotten, without good right to be, semi-manufactured, made less by God
    </p>
    <p>
     than man, born out of time and place, yet their voices are strangely human and
    </p>
    <p>
     call out one's pity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our way is still along the Merced and Tuolumne divide, the streams on our
    </p>
    <p>
     right going to swell the songful Yosemite River, those on our left to the songful
    </p>
    <p>
     Tuolumne, slipping through sunny carex and lily meadows, and breaking into
    </p>
    <p>
     song down a thousand ravines almost as soon as they are born. A more tuneful
    </p>
    <p>
     set of streams surely nowhere exists, or more sparkling crystal pure, now
    </p>
    <p>
     gliding with tinkling whisper, now with merry dimpling rush, in and out
    </p>
    <p>
     through sunshine and shade, shimmering in pools, uniting their currents,
    </p>
    <p>
     bouncing, dancing from form to form over cliffs and inclines, ever more
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful the farther they go until they pour into the main glacial rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
     All day I have been gazing in growing admiration at the noble groups of the
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificent silver fir which more and more is taking the ground to itself. The
    </p>
    <p>
     woods above Crane Flat still continue comparatively open, letting in the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunshine on the brown needle-strewn ground. Not only are the individual trees
    </p>
    <p>
     admirable in symmetry and superb in foliage and port, but half a dozen or
    </p>
    <p>
     more often form temple groves in which the trees are so nicely graded in size
    </p>
    <p>
     and position as to seem one. Here, indeed, is the tree-lover's paradise. The
    </p>
    <p>
     dullest eye in the world must surely be quickened by such trees as these.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately the sheep need little attention, as they are driven slowly and
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed to nip and nibble as they like. Since leaving Hazel Green we have been
    </p>
    <p>
     following the Yosemite trail; visitors to the famous valley coming by way of
    </p>
    <p>
     Coulterville and Chinese Camp pass this way—the two trails uniting at Crane
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat—and enter the valley on the north side. Another trail enters on the south
    </p>
    <p>
     side by way of Mariposa. The tourists we saw were in parties of from three or
    </p>
    <p>
     four to fifteen or twenty, mounted on mules or small mustang ponies. A strange
    </p>
    <p>
     show they made, winding single file through the solemn woods in gaudy attire,
    </p>
    <p>
     scaring the wild creatures, and one might fancy that even the great pines
    </p>
    <p>
     would be disturbed and groan aghast. But what may we say of ourselves and
    </p>
    <p>
     the flock?
    </p>
    <p>
     We are now camped at Tamarack Flat, within four or five miles of the lower end
    </p>
    <p>
     of Yosemite. Here is another fine meadow embosomed in the woods, with a
    </p>
    <p>
     deep, clear stream gliding through it, its banks rounded and beveled with a
    </p>
    <p>
     thatch of dipping sedges. The flat is named after the two-leaved pine Pinus
    </p>
    <p>
     contorta, var. Murrayana, common here, especially around the cool margin of
    </p>
    <p>
     the meadow. On rocky ground it is a rough, thickset tree, about forty to sixty
    </p>
    <p>
     feet high and one to three feet in diameter, bark thin and gummy, branches
    </p>
    <p>
     rather naked, tassels, leaves, and cones small. But in damp, rich soil it grows
    </p>
    <p>
     close and slender, and reaches a height at times of nearly a hundred feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Specimens only six inches in diameter at the ground are often fifty or sixty feet
    </p>
    <p>
     in height, as slender and sharp in outline as arrows, like the true tamarack
    </p>
    <p>
     larch of the Eastern States; hence the name, though it is a pine.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . The Don has gone ahead on one of the pack animals to spy out the land
    </p>
    <p>
     to the north of Yosemite in search of the best point for a central camp. Much
    </p>
    <p>
     higher than this we cannot now go, for the upper pastures, said to be better
    </p>
    <p>
     than any hereabouts, are still buried in heavy winter snow. Glad I am that
    </p>
    <p>
     camp is to be fixed in the Yosemite region, for many a glorious ramble I'll have
    </p>
    <p>
     along the top of the walls, and then what landscapes I shall find with their new
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains and cañons, forests and gardens, lakes and streams and falls.
    </p>
    <p>
     We are now about seven thousand feet above the sea, and the nights are so
    </p>
    <p>
     cool we have to pile coats and extra clothing on top of our blankets. Tamarack
    </p>
    <p>
     Creek is icy cold, delicious, exhilarating champagne water. It is flowing bankfull in the meadow with silent speed, but only a few hundred yards below our
    </p>
    <p>
     camp the ground is bare gray granite strewn with boulders, large spaces being
    </p>
    <p>
     without a single tree or only a small one here and there anchored in narrow
    </p>
    <p>
     seams and cracks. The boulders, many of them very large, are not in piles or
    </p>
    <p>
     scattered like rubbish among loose crumbling débris as if weathered out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     solid as boulders of disintegration; they mostly occur singly, and are lying on a
    </p>
    <p>
     clean pavement on which the sunshine falls in a glare that contrasts with the
    </p>
    <p>
     shimmer of light and shade we have been accustomed to in the leafy woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, strange to say, these boulders lying so still and deserted, with no moving
    </p>
    <p>
     force near them, no boulder carrier anywhere in sight, were nevertheless
    </p>
    <p>
     brought from a distance, as difference in color and composition shows,
    </p>
    <p>
     quarried and carried and laid down here each in its place; nor have they
    </p>
    <p>
     stirred, most of them, through calm and storm since first they arrived. They
    </p>
    <p>
     look lonely here, strangers in a strange land,—huge blocks, angular mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     chips, the largest twenty or thirty feet in diameter, the chips that Nature has
    </p>
    <p>
     made in modeling her landscapes, fashioning the forms of her mountains and
    </p>
    <p>
     valleys. And with what tool were they quarried and carried? On the pavement
    </p>
    <p>
     we find its marks. The most resisting unweathered portion of the surface is
    </p>
    <p>
     scored and striated in a rigidly parallel way, indicating that the region has been
    </p>
    <p>
     overswept by a glacier from the northeastward, grinding down the general mass
    </p>
    <p>
     of the mountains, scoring and polishing, producing a strange, raw, wiped
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance, and dropping whatever boulders it chanced to be carrying at the
    </p>
    <p>
     time it was melted at the close of the Glacial Period. A fine discovery this. As for
    </p>
    <p>
     the forests we have been passing through, they are probably growing on
    </p>
    <p>
     deposits of soil most of which has been laid down by this same ice agent in the
    </p>
    <p>
     form of moraines of different sorts, now in great part disintegrated and
    </p>
    <p>
     outspread by post-glacial weathering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Out of the grassy meadow and down over this ice-planed granite runs the glad
    </p>
    <p>
     young Tamarack Creek, rejoicing, exulting, chanting, dancing in white,
    </p>
    <p>
     glowing, irised falls and cascades on its way to the Merced Cañon, a few miles
    </p>
    <p>
     below Yosemite, falling more than three thousand feet in a distance of about
    </p>
    <p>
     two miles.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the Merced streams are wonderful singers, and Yosemite is the centre where
    </p>
    <p>
     the main tributaries meet. From a point about half a mile from our camp we
    </p>
    <p>
     can see into the lower end of the famous valley, with its wonderful cliffs and
    </p>
    <p>
     groves, a grand page of mountain manuscript that I would gladly give my life to
    </p>
    <p>
     be able to read. How vast it seems, how short human life when we happen to
    </p>
    <p>
     think of it, and how little we may learn, however hard we try! Yet why bewail
    </p>
    <p>
     our poor inevitable ignorance? Some of the external beauty is always in sight,
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to keep every fibre of us tingling, and this we are able to gloriously
    </p>
    <p>
     enjoy though the methods of its creation may lie beyond our ken. Sing on,
    </p>
    <p>
     brave Tamarack Creek, fresh from your snowy fountains, plash and swirl and
    </p>
    <p>
     dance to your fate in the sea; bathing, cheering every living thing along your
    </p>
    <p>
     way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Have greatly enjoyed all this huge day, sauntering and seeing, steeping in the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain influences, sketching, noting, pressing flowers, drinking ozone and
    </p>
    <p>
     Tamarack water. Found the white fragrant Washington lily, the finest of all the
    </p>
    <p>
     Sierra lilies. Its bulbs are buried in shaggy chaparral tangles, I suppose for
    </p>
    <p>
     safety from pawing bears; and its magnificent panicles sway and rock over the
    </p>
    <p>
     top of the rough snow-pressed bushes, while big, bold, blunt-nosed bees drone
    </p>
    <p>
     and mumble in its polleny bells. A lovely flower, worth going hungry and
    </p>
    <p>
     footsore endless miles to see. The whole world seems richer now that I have
    </p>
    <p>
     found this plant in so noble a landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
     A log house serves to mark a claim to the Tamarack meadow, which may
    </p>
    <p>
     become valuable as a station in case travel to Yosemite should greatly increase.
    </p>
    <p>
     Belated parties occasionally stop here. A white man with an Indian woman is
    </p>
    <p>
     holding possession of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sauntered up the meadow about sundown, out of sight of camp and sheep and
    </p>
    <p>
     all human mark, into the deep peace of the solemn old woods, everything
    </p>
    <p>
     glowing with Heaven's unquenchable enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . The Don has returned, and again we go on pilgrimage. "Looking over the
    </p>
    <p>
     Yosemite Creek country," he said, "from the tops of the hills you see nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     but rocks and patches of trees; but when you go down into the rocky desert
    </p>
    <p>
     you find no end of small grassy banks and meadows, and so the country is not
    </p>
    <p>
     half so lean as it looks. There we'll go and stay until the snow is melted from
    </p>
    <p>
     the upper country."
    </p>
    <p>
     I was glad to hear that the high snow made a stay in the Yosemite region
    </p>
    <p>
     necessary, for I am anxious to see as much of it as possible. What fine times I
    </p>
    <p>
     shall have sketching, studying plants and rocks, and scrambling about the
    </p>
    <p>
     brink of the great valley alone, out of sight and sound of camp!
    </p>
    <p>
     We saw another party of Yosemite tourists to-day. Somehow most of these
    </p>
    <p>
     travelers seem to care but little for the glorious objects about them, though
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to spend time and money and endure long rides to see the famous
    </p>
    <p>
     valley. And when they are fairly within the mighty walls of the temple and hear
    </p>
    <p>
     the psalms of the falls, they will forget themselves and become devout. Blessed,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, should be every pilgrim in these holy mountains!
    </p>
    <p>
     We moved slowly eastward along the Mono Trail, and early in the afternoon
    </p>
    <p>
     unpacked and camped on the bank of Cascade Creek. The Mono Trail crosses
    </p>
    <p>
     the range by the Bloody Cañon Pass to gold mines near the north end of Mono
    </p>
    <p>
     Lake. These mines were reported to be rich when first discovered, and a grand
    </p>
    <p>
     rush took place, making a trail necessary. A few small bridges were built over
    </p>
    <p>
     streams where fording was not practicable on account of the softness of the
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom, sections of fallen trees cut out, and lanes made through thickets wide
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to allow the passage of bulky packs; but over the greater part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     way scarce a stone or shovelful of earth has been moved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woods we passed through are composed almost wholly of Abies magnifica,
    </p>
    <p>
     the companion species, concolor, being mostly left behind on account of
    </p>
    <p>
     altitude, while the increasing elevation seems grateful to the charming
    </p>
    <p>
     magnifica. No words can do anything like justice to this noble tree. At one place
    </p>
    <p>
     many had fallen during some heavy wind-storm, owing to the loose sandy
    </p>
    <p>
     character of the soil, which offered no secure anchorage. The soil is mostly
    </p>
    <p>
     decomposed and disintegrated moraine material.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sheep are lying down on a bare rocky spot such as they like, chewing the
    </p>
    <p>
     cud in grassy peace. Cooking is going on, appetites growing keener every day.
    </p>
    <p>
     No lowlander can appreciate the mountain appetite, and the facility with which
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy food called "grub" is disposed of. Eating, walking, resting, seem alike
    </p>
    <p>
     delightful, and one feels inclined to shout lustily on rising in the morning like a
    </p>
    <p>
     crowing cock. Sleep and digestion as clear as the air. Fine spicy plush boughs
    </p>
    <p>
     for bedding we shall have to-night, and a glorious lullaby from this cascading
    </p>
    <p>
     creek. Never was stream more fittingly named, for as far as I have traced it
    </p>
    <p>
     above and below our camp it is one continuous bouncing, dancing, white
    </p>
    <p>
     bloom of cascades. And at the very last unwearied it finishes its wild course in
    </p>
    <p>
     a grand leap of three hundred feet or more to the bottom of the main Yosemite
    </p>
    <p>
     cañon near the fall of Tamarack Creek, a few miles below the foot of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
     These falls almost rival some of the far-famed Yosemite falls. Never shall I
    </p>
    <p>
     forget these glad cascade songs, the low booming, the roaring, the keen, silvery
    </p>
    <p>
     clashing of the cool water rushing exulting from form to form beneath irised
    </p>
    <p>
     spray; or in the deep still night seen white in the darkness, and its multitude of
    </p>
    <p>
     voices sounding still more impressively sublime. Here I find the little water
    </p>
    <p>
     ouzel as much at home as any linnet in a leafy grove, seeming to take the
    </p>
    <p>
     greater delight the more boisterous the stream. The dizzy precipices, the swift
    </p>
    <p>
     dashing energy displayed, and the thunder tones of the sheer falls are awe
    </p>
    <p>
     inspir ing, but there is nothing awful about this little bird. Its song is sweet and
    </p>
    <p>
     low, and all its gestures, as it flits about amid the loud uproar, bespeak
    </p>
    <p>
     strength and peace and joy. Contemplating these darlings of Nature coming
    </p>
    <p>
     forth from spray-sprinkled nests on the brink of savage streams, Samson's
    </p>
    <p>
     riddle comes to mind, "Out of the strong cometh forth sweetness." A yet finer
    </p>
    <p>
     bloom is this little bird than the foam-bells in eddying pools. Gentle bird, a
    </p>
    <p>
     precious message you bring me. We may miss the meaning of the torrent, but
    </p>
    <p>
     thy sweet voice, only love is in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Our course all day has been eastward over the rim of Yosemite Creek
    </p>
    <p>
     basin and down about halfway to the bottom, where we have encamped on a
    </p>
    <p>
     sheet of glacier-polished granite, a firm foundation for beds. Saw the tracks of a
    </p>
    <p>
     very large bear on the trail, and the Don talked of bears in general. I said I
    </p>
    <p>
     should like to see the maker of these immense tracks as he marched along,
    </p>
    <p>
     and follow him for days, without disturbing him, to learn something of the life
    </p>
    <p>
     of this master beast of the wilderness. Lambs, the Don told me, born in the
    </p>
    <p>
     lowland, that never saw or heard a bear, snort and run in terror when they
    </p>
    <p>
     catch the scent, showing how fully they have inherited a knowledge of their
    </p>
    <p>
     enemy. Hogs, mules, horses, and cattle are afraid of bears, and are seized with
    </p>
    <p>
     ungovernable terror when they approach, particularly hogs and mules. Hogs
    </p>
    <p>
     are frequently driven to pastures in the foothills of the Coast Range and Sierra
    </p>
    <p>
     where acorns are abundant, and are herded in droves of hundreds like sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
     When a bear comes to the range they promptly leave it, emigrating in a body,
    </p>
    <p>
     usually in the night time, the keepers being powerless to prevent; they thus
    </p>
    <p>
     show more sense than sheep, that simply scatter in the rocks and brush and
    </p>
    <p>
     await their fate. Mules flee like the wind with or without riders when they see a
    </p>
    <p>
     bear, and, if picketed, sometimes break their necks in trying to break their
    </p>
    <p>
     ropes, though I have not heard of bears killing mules or horses. Of hogs they
    </p>
    <p>
     are said to be particularly fond, bolting small ones, bones and all, without
    </p>
    <p>
     choice of parts. In particular, Mr. Delaney assured me that all kinds of bears in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sierra are very shy, and that hunters found far greater difficulty in getting
    </p>
    <p>
     within gunshot of them than of deer or indeed any other animal in the Sierra,
    </p>
    <p>
     and if I was anxious to see much of them I should have to wait and watch with
    </p>
    <p>
     endless Indian patience and pay no attention to anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Night is coming on, the gray rock waves are growing dim in the twilight. How
    </p>
    <p>
     raw and young this region appears! Had the ice sheet that swept over it
    </p>
    <p>
     vanished but yesterday, its traces on the more resisting portions about our
    </p>
    <p>
     camp could hardly be more distinct than they now are. The horses and sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     and all of us, indeed, slipped on the smoothest places.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . How deathlike is sleep in this mountain air, and quick the awakening
    </p>
    <p>
     into newness of life! A calm dawn, yellow and purple, then floods of sun-gold,
    </p>
    <p>
     making every thing tingle and glow.
    </p>
    <p>
     In an hour or two we came to Yosemite Creek, the stream that makes the
    </p>
    <p>
     greatest of all the Yosemite falls. It is about forty feet wide at the Mono Trail
    </p>
    <p>
     crossing, and now about four feet in average depth, flowing about three miles
    </p>
    <p>
     an hour. The distance to the verge of the Yosemite wall, where it makes its
    </p>
    <p>
     tremendous plunge, is only about two miles from here. Calm, beautiful, and
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly silent, it glides with stately gestures, a dense growth of the slender twoleaved pine along its banks, and a fringe of willow, purple spirea, sedges,
    </p>
    <p>
     daisies, lilies, and columbines. Some of the sedges and willow boughs dip into
    </p>
    <p>
     the current, and just outside of the close ranks of trees there is a sunny flat of
    </p>
    <p>
     washed gravelly sand which seems to have been deposited by some ancient
    </p>
    <p>
     flood. It is covered with millions of erethrea, eriogonum, and oxytheca, with
    </p>
    <p>
     more flowers than leaves, forming an even growth, slightly dimpled and ruffled
    </p>
    <p>
     here and there by rosettes of Spraguea umbellata. Back of this flowery strip
    </p>
    <p>
     there is a wavy upsloping plain of solid granite, so smoothly ice-polished in
    </p>
    <p>
     many places that it glistens in the sun like glass. In shallow hollows there are
    </p>
    <p>
     patches of trees, mostly the rough form of the two-leaved pine, rather scrawny
    </p>
    <p>
     looking where there is little or no soil. Also a few junipers Juniperus
    </p>
    <p>
     occidentalis, short and stout, with bright cinnamon-colored bark and gray
    </p>
    <p>
     foliage, standing alone mostly, on the sun-beaten pavement, safe from fire,
    </p>
    <p>
     clinging by slight joints,—a sturdy storm-enduring mountaineer of a tree, living
    </p>
    <p>
     on sunshine and snow, maintaining tough health on this diet for perhaps more
    </p>
    <p>
     than a thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
     Up towards the head of the basin I see groups of domes rising above the
    </p>
    <p>
     wavelike ridges, and some picturesque castellated masses, and dark strips and
    </p>
    <p>
     patches of silver fir, indicating deposits of fertile soil. Would that I could
    </p>
    <p>
     command the time to study them! What rich excursions one could make in this
    </p>
    <p>
     well-defined basin! Its glacial inscriptions and sculptures, how marvelous they
    </p>
    <p>
     seem, how noble the studies they offer! I tremble with excitement in the dawn
    </p>
    <p>
     of these glorious mountain sublim ities, but I can only gaze and wonder, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a child, gather here and there a lily, half hoping I may be able to study and
    </p>
    <p>
     learn in years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
     The drivers and dogs had a lively, laborious time getting the sheep across the
    </p>
    <p>
     creek, the second large stream thus far that they have been compelled to cross
    </p>
    <p>
     without a bridge; the first being the North Fork of the Merced near Bower Cave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Men and dogs, shouting and barking, drove the timid, water-fearing creatures
    </p>
    <p>
     in a close crowd against the bank, but not one of the flock would launch away.
    </p>
    <p>
     While thus jammed, the Don and the shepherd rushed through the frightened
    </p>
    <p>
     crowd to stampede those in front, but this would only cause a break backward,
    </p>
    <p>
     and away they would scamper through the stream-bank trees and scatter over
    </p>
    <p>
     the rocky pavement. Then with the aid of the dogs the runaways would again
    </p>
    <p>
     be gathered and made to face the stream, and again the compacted mass
    </p>
    <p>
     would break away, amid wild shouting and barking that might well have
    </p>
    <p>
     disturbed the stream itself and marred the music of its falls, to which visitors
    </p>
    <p>
     no doubt from all quarters of the globe were listening. "Hold them there! Now
    </p>
    <p>
     hold them there!" shouted the Don; "the front ranks will soon tire of the
    </p>
    <p>
     pressure, and be glad to take to the water, then all will jump in and cross in a
    </p>
    <p>
     hurry." But they did nothing of the kind; they only avoided the pressure by
    </p>
    <p>
     breaking back in scores and hundreds, leaving the beauty of the banks sadly
    </p>
    <p>
     trampled.
    </p>
    <p>
     If only one could be got to cross over, all would make haste to follow; but that
    </p>
    <p>
     one could not be found. A lamb was caught, carried across, and tied to a bush
    </p>
    <p>
     on the opposite bank, where it cried piteously for its mother. But though
    </p>
    <p>
     greatly concerned, the mother only called it back. That play on maternal
    </p>
    <p>
     affection failed, and we began to fear that we should be forced to make a long
    </p>
    <p>
     roundabout drive and cross the wide-spread tributaries of the creek in
    </p>
    <p>
     succession. This would require several days, but it had its advantages, for I
    </p>
    <p>
     was eager to see the sources of so famous a stream. Don Quixote, however,
    </p>
    <p>
     determined that they must ford just here, and immediately began a sort of
    </p>
    <p>
     siege by cutting down slender pines on the bank and building a corral barely
    </p>
    <p>
     large enough to hold the flock when well pressed together. And as the stream
    </p>
    <p>
     would form one side of the corral he believed that they could easily be forced
    </p>
    <p>
     into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a few hours the inclosure was completed, and the silly animals were driven
    </p>
    <p>
     in and rammed hard against the brink of the ford. Then the Don, forcing a way
    </p>
    <p>
     through the compacted mass, pitched a few of the terrified unfortunates into
    </p>
    <p>
     the stream by main strength; but instead of crossing over, they swam about
    </p>
    <p>
     close to the bank, making desperate attempts to get back into the flock. Then a
    </p>
    <p>
     dozen or more were shoved off, and the Don, tall like a crane and a good
    </p>
    <p>
     natural wader, jumped in after them, seized a struggling wether, and dragged it
    </p>
    <p>
     to the opposite shore. But no sooner did he let it go than it jumped into the
    </p>
    <p>
     stream and swam back to its frightened companions in the corral, thus
    </p>
    <p>
     manifesting sheep-nature as unchangeable as gravitation. Pan with his pipes
    </p>
    <p>
     would have had no better luck, I fear. We were now pretty well baffled. The silly
    </p>
    <p>
     creatures would suffer any sort of death rather than cross that stream. Calling
    </p>
    <p>
     a council, the dripping Don declared that starvation was now the only likely
    </p>
    <p>
     scheme to try, and that we might as well camp here in comfort and let the
    </p>
    <p>
     besieged flock grow hungry and cool, and come to their senses, if they had any.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a few minutes after being thus let alone, an adventurer in the foremost rank
    </p>
    <p>
     plunged in and swam bravely to the farther shore. Then suddenly all rushed in
    </p>
    <p>
     pell-mell together, trampling one another under water, while we vainly tried to
    </p>
    <p>
     hold them back. The Don jumped into the thickest of the gasping, gurgling,
    </p>
    <p>
     drowning mass, and shoved them right and left as if each sheep was a piece of
    </p>
    <p>
     floating timber. The current also served to drift them apart; a long bent column
    </p>
    <p>
     was soon formed, and in a few minutes all were over and began baaing and
    </p>
    <p>
     feeding as if nothing out of the common had happened. That none were
    </p>
    <p>
     drowned seems wonderful. I fully expected that hundreds would gain the
    </p>
    <p>
     romantic fate of being swept into Yosemite over the highest waterfall in the
    </p>
    <p>
     world.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the day was far spent, we camped a little way back from the ford, and let the
    </p>
    <p>
     dripping flock scatter and feed until sundown. The wool is dry now, and calm,
    </p>
    <p>
     cud-chewing peace has fallen on all the comfortable band, leaving no trace of
    </p>
    <p>
     the watery battle. I have seen fish driven out of the water with less ado than
    </p>
    <p>
     was made in driving these animals into it. Sheep brain must surely be poor
    </p>
    <p>
     stuff. Compare today's exhibition with the performances of deer swimming
    </p>
    <p>
     quietly across broad and rapid rivers, and from island to island in seas and
    </p>
    <p>
     lakes; or with dogs, or even with the squirrels that, as the story goes, cross the
    </p>
    <p>
     Mississippi River on selected chips, with tails for sails comfortably trimmed to
    </p>
    <p>
     the breeze. A sheep can hardly be called an animal; an entire flock is required
    </p>
    <p>
     to make one foolish individual.

    <p>
     THE YOSEMITE
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Followed the Mono Trail up the eastern rim of the basin nearly to its
    </p>
    <p>
     summit, then turned off southward to a small shallow valley that extends to
    </p>
    <p>
     the edge of the Yosemite, which we reached about noon, and encamped. After
    </p>
    <p>
     luncheon I made haste to high ground, and from the top of the ridge on the
    </p>
    <p>
     west side of Indian Cañon gained the noblest view of the summit peaks I have
    </p>
    <p>
     ever yet enjoyed. Nearly all the upper basin of the Merced was displayed, with
    </p>
    <p>
     its sublime domes and cañons, dark upsweeping forests, and glorious array of
    </p>
    <p>
     white peaks deep in the sky, every feature glowing, radiating beauty that pours
    </p>
    <p>
     into our flesh and bones like heat rays from fire. Sunshine over all; no breath
    </p>
    <p>
     of wind to stir the brooding calm. Never before had I seen so glorious a
    </p>
    <p>
     landscape, so boundless an affluence of sublime mountain beauty. The most
    </p>
    <p>
     extravagant description I might give of this view to any one who has not seen
    </p>
    <p>
     similar landscapes with his own eyes would not so much as hint its grandeur
    </p>
    <p>
     and the spiritual glow that covered it. I shouted and gestic ulated in a wild
    </p>
    <p>
     burst of ecstasy, much to the astonishment of St. Bernard Carlo, who came
    </p>
    <p>
     running up to me, manifesting in his intelligent eyes a puzzled concern that
    </p>
    <p>
     was very ludicrous, which had the effect of bringing me to my senses. A brown
    </p>
    <p>
     bear, too, it would seem, had been a spectator of the show I had made of
    </p>
    <p>
     myself, for I had gone but a few yards when I started one from a thicket of
    </p>
    <p>
     brush. He evidently considered me dangerous, for he ran away very fast,
    </p>
    <p>
     tumbling over the tops of the tangled manzanita bushes in his haste. Carlo
    </p>
    <p>
     drew back, with his ears depressed as if afraid, and kept looking me in the
    </p>
    <p>
     face, as if expecting me to pursue and shoot, for he had seen many a bear
    </p>
    <p>
     battle in his day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Following the ridge, which made a gradual descent to the south, I came at
    </p>
    <p>
     length to the brow of that massive cliff that stands between Indian Cañon and
    </p>
    <p>
     Yosemite Falls, and here the far-famed valley came suddenly into view
    </p>
    <p>
     throughout almost its whole extent. The noble walls—sculptured into endless
    </p>
    <p>
     variety of domes and gables, spires and battlements and plain mural
    </p>
    <p>
     precipices—all a-tremble with the thunder tones of the falling water. The level
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom seemed to be dressed like a garden—sunny meadows here and there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and groves of pine and oak; the river of Mercy sweeping in majesty through the
    </p>
    <p>
     midst of them and flashing back the sunbeams. The great Tissiack, or HalfDome, rising at the upper end of the valley to a height of nearly a mile, is nobly
    </p>
    <p>
     proportioned and life-like, the most impressive of all the rocks, holding the eye
    </p>
    <p>
     in devout admiration, calling it back again and again from falls or meadows, or
    </p>
    <p>
     even the mountains beyond,—marvelous cliffs, marvelous in sheer dizzy depth
    </p>
    <p>
     and sculpture, types of endurance. Thousands of years have they stood in the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky exposed to rain, snow, frost, earthquake and avalanche, yet they still wear
    </p>
    <p>
     the bloom of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
     I rambled along the valley rim to the westward; most of it is rounded off on the
    </p>
    <p>
     very brink, so that it is not easy to find places where one may look clear down
    </p>
    <p>
     the face of the wall to the bottom. When such places were found, and I had
    </p>
    <p>
     cautiously set my feet and drawn my body erect, I could not help fearing a little
    </p>
    <p>
     that the rock might split off and let me down, and what a down!—more than
    </p>
    <p>
     three thousand feet. Still my limbs did not tremble, nor did I feel the least
    </p>
    <p>
     uncertainty as to the reliance to be placed on them. My only fear was that a
    </p>
    <p>
     flake of the granite, which in some places showed joints more or less open and
    </p>
    <p>
     running parallel with the face of the cliff, might give way. After withdrawing
    </p>
    <p>
     from such places, excited with the view I had got, I would say to myself, "Now
    </p>
    <p>
     don't go out on the verge again." But in the face of Yosemite scenery cautious
    </p>
    <p>
     remonstrance is vain; under its spell one's body seems to go where it likes with
    </p>
    <p>
     a will over which we seem to have scarce any control.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a mile or so of this memorable cliff work I approached Yosemite Creek,
    </p>
    <p>
     admiring its easy, graceful, confident gestures as it comes bravely forward in
    </p>
    <p>
     its narrow channel, singing the last of its mountain songs on its way to its
    </p>
    <p>
     fate—a few rods more over the shining granite, then down half a mile in showy
    </p>
    <p>
     foam to another world, to be lost in the Merced, where climate, vegetation,
    </p>
    <p>
     inhabitants, all are different. Emerging from its last gorge, it glides in wide
    </p>
    <p>
     lace-like rapids down a smooth incline into a pool where it seems to rest and
    </p>
    <p>
     compose its gray, agitated waters before taking the grand plunge, then slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     slipping over the lip of the pool basin, it descends another glossy slope with
    </p>
    <p>
     rapidly accelerated speed to the brink of the tremendous cliff, and with
    </p>
    <p>
     sublime, fateful confidence springs out free in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     I took off my shoes and stockings and worked my way cautiously down
    </p>
    <p>
     alongside the rushing flood, keeping my feet and hands pressed firmly on the
    </p>
    <p>
     polished rock. The booming, roaring water, rushing past close to my head, was
    </p>
    <p>
     very exciting. I had expected that the sloping apron would terminate with the
    </p>
    <p>
     perpendicular wall of the valley, and that from the foot of it, where it is less
    </p>
    <p>
     steeply inclined, I should be able to lean far enough out to see the forms and
    </p>
    <p>
     behavior of the fall all the way down to the bottom. But I found that there was
    </p>
    <p>
     yet another small brow over which I could not see, and which appeared to be
    </p>
    <p>
     too steep for mortal feet. Scanning it keenly, I discovered a narrow shelf about
    </p>
    <p>
     three inches wide on the very brink, just wide enough for a rest for one's heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there seemed to be no way of reaching it over so steep a brow. At length,
    </p>
    <p>
     after careful scrutiny of the surface, I found an irregular edge of a flake of the
    </p>
    <p>
     rock some distance back from the margin of the torrent. If I was to get down to
    </p>
    <p>
     the brink at all that rough edge, which might offer slight finger-holds, was the
    </p>
    <p>
     only way. But the slope beside it looked dangerously smooth and steep, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the swift roaring flood beneath, overhead, and beside me was very nerve-trying.
    </p>
    <p>
     I therefore concluded not to venture farther, but did nevertheless. Tufts of
    </p>
    <p>
     artemisia were growing in clefts of the rock near by, and I filled my mouth with
    </p>
    <p>
     the bitter leaves, hoping they might help to prevent giddiness. Then, with a
    </p>
    <p>
     caution not known in ordinary cir cumstances, I crept down safely to the little
    </p>
    <p>
     ledge, got my heels well planted on it, then shuffled in a horizontal direction
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty or thirty feet until close to the outplunging current, which, by the time
    </p>
    <p>
     it had descended thus far, was already white. Here I obtained a perfectly free
    </p>
    <p>
     view down into the heart of the snowy, chanting throng of comet-like
    </p>
    <p>
     streamers, into which the body of the fall soon separates.
    </p>
    <p>
     While perched on that narrow niche I was not distinctly conscious of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tremendous grandeur of the fall in form and sound and motion, acting at
    </p>
    <p>
     close range, smothered the sense of fear, and in such places one's body takes
    </p>
    <p>
     keen care for safety on its own account. How long I remained down there, or
    </p>
    <p>
     how I returned, I can hardly tell. Anyhow I had a glorious time, and got back to
    </p>
    <p>
     camp about dark, enjoying triumphant exhilaration soon followed by dull
    </p>
    <p>
     weariness. Hereafter I'll try to keep from such extravagant, nerve-straining
    </p>
    <p>
     places. Yet such a day is well worth venturing for. My first view of the High
    </p>
    <p>
     Sierra, first view looking down into Yosemite, the death song of Yosemite Creek,
    </p>
    <p>
     and its flight over the vast cliff, each one of these is of itself enough for a great
    </p>
    <p>
     life-long landscape fortune—a most memorable day of days—enjoyment enough
    </p>
    <p>
     to kill if that were possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . My enjoyments yesterday afternoon, especially at the head of the fall,
    </p>
    <p>
     were too great for good sleep. Kept starting up last night in a nervous tremor,
    </p>
    <p>
     half awake, fancying that the foundation of the mountain we were camped on
    </p>
    <p>
     had given way and was falling into Yosemite Valley. In vain I roused myself to
    </p>
    <p>
     make a new beginning for sound sleep. The nerve strain had been too great,
    </p>
    <p>
     and again and again I dreamed I was rushing through the air above a glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     avalanche of water and rocks. One time, springing to my feet, I said, "This time
    </p>
    <p>
     it is real—all must die, and where could mountaineer find a more glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     death!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Left camp soon after sunrise for an all-day ramble eastward. Crossed the head
    </p>
    <p>
     of Indian Basin, forested with Abies magnifica, underbrush mostly Ceanothus
    </p>
    <p>
     cordulatus and manzanita, a mixture not easily trampled over or penetrated,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the ceanothus is thorny and grows in dense snow-pressed masses, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     manzanita has exceedingly crooked, stubborn branches. From the head of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cañon continued on past North Dome into the basin of Dome or Porcupine
    </p>
    <p>
     Creek. Here are many fine meadows imbedded in the woods, gay with Lilium
    </p>
    <p>
     parvum and its companions; the elevation, about eight thousand feet, seems to
    </p>
    <p>
     be best suited for it—saw specimens that were a foot or two higher than my
    </p>
    <p>
     head. Had more magnificent views of the upper mountains, and of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     South Dome, said to be the grandest rock in the world. Well it may be, since it
    </p>
    <p>
     is of such noble dimensions and sculpture. A wonderfully impressive
    </p>
    <p>
     monument, its lines exquisite in fineness, and though sublime in size, is
    </p>
    <p>
     finished like the finest work of art, and seems to be alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . A new camp was made to-day in a magnificent silver fir grove at the head
    </p>
    <p>
     of a small stream that flows into Yosemite by way of Indian Cañon. Here we
    </p>
    <p>
     intend to stay several weeks,—a fine location from which to make excursions
    </p>
    <p>
     about the great valley and its fountains. Glorious days I'll have sketching,
    </p>
    <p>
     pressing plants, studying the wonderful topography and the wild animals, our
    </p>
    <p>
     happy fellow mortals and neighbors. But the vast mountains in the distance,
    </p>
    <p>
     shall I ever know them, shall I be allowed to enter into their midst and dwell
    </p>
    <p>
     with them?
    </p>
    <p>
     The North and South Domes
    </p>
    <p>
     We were pelted about noon by a short, heavy rainstorm, sublime thunder
    </p>
    <p>
     reverberating among the mountains and cañons,—some strokes near, crashing,
    </p>
    <p>
     ringing in the tense crisp air with startling keenness, while the distant peaks
    </p>
    <p>
     loomed gloriously through the cloud fringes and sheets of rain. Now the storm
    </p>
    <p>
     is past, and the fresh washed air is full of the essences of the flower gardens
    </p>
    <p>
     and groves. Winter storms in Yosemite must be glorious. May I see them!
    </p>
    <p>
     Have got my bed made in our new camp,—plushy, sumptuous, and deliciously
    </p>
    <p>
     fragrant, most of it magnifica fir plumes, of course, with a variety of sweet
    </p>
    <p>
     flowers in the pillow. Hope to sleep to-night without tottering nerve-dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
     Watched a deer eating ceanothus leaves and twigs.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Slept pretty well; the valley walls did not seem to fall, though I still
    </p>
    <p>
     fancied myself at the brink, alongside the white, plunging flood, especially
    </p>
    <p>
     when half asleep. Strange the danger of that adventure should be more
    </p>
    <p>
     troublesome now that I am in the bosom of the peaceful woods, a mile or more
    </p>
    <p>
     from the fall, than it was while I was on the brink of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bears seem to be common here, judging by their tracks. About noon we had
    </p>
    <p>
     another rainstorm with keen startling thunder, the metallic, ringing, clashing,
    </p>
    <p>
     clanging notes gradually fading into low bass rolling and muttering in the
    </p>
    <p>
     distance. For a few minutes the rain came in a grand torrent like a waterfall,
    </p>
    <p>
     then hail; some of the hailstones an inch in diameter, hard, icy, and irregular
    </p>
    <p>
     in form, like those oftentimes seen in Wisconsin. Carlo watched them with
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligent astonishment as they came pelting and thrashing through the
    </p>
    <p>
     quivering branches of the trees. The cloud scenery sublime. Afternoon calm,
    </p>
    <p>
     sunful, and clear, with delicious freshness and fragrance from the firs and
    </p>
    <p>
     flowers and steaming ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Watching the daybreak and sunrise. The pale rose and purple sky
    </p>
    <p>
     changing softly to daffodil yellow and white, sunbeams pouring through the
    </p>
    <p>
     passes between the peaks and over the Yosemite domes, making their edges
    </p>
    <p>
     burn; the silver firs in the middle ground catching the glow on their spiry tops,
    </p>
    <p>
     and our camp grove fills and thrills with the glorious light. Everything
    </p>
    <p>
     awakening alert and joyful; the birds begin to stir and innumerable insect
    </p>
    <p>
     people. Deer quietly withdraw into leafy hiding-places in the chaparral; the dew
    </p>
    <p>
     vanishes, flowers spread their petals, every pulse beats high, every life cell
    </p>
    <p>
     rejoices, the very rocks seem to thrill with life. The whole landscape glows like a
    </p>
    <p>
     human face in a glory of enthusiasm, and the blue sky, pale around the
    </p>
    <p>
     horizon, bends peacefully down over all like one vast flower.
    </p>
    <p>
     About noon, as usual, big bossy cumuli began to grow above the forest, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     rainstorm pouring from them is the most imposing I have yet seen. The silvery
    </p>
    <p>
     zigzag lightning lances are longer than usual, and the thunder gloriously
    </p>
    <p>
     impressive, keen, crashing, intensely concentrated, speaking with such
    </p>
    <p>
     tremendous energy it would seem that an entire mountain is being shattered at
    </p>
    <p>
     every stroke, but probably only a few trees are being shattered, many of which I
    </p>
    <p>
     have seen on my walks hereabouts strewing the ground. At last the clear
    </p>
    <p>
     ringing strokes are succeeded by deep low tones that grow gradually fainter as
    </p>
    <p>
     they roll afar into the recesses of the echoing mountains, where they seem to
    </p>
    <p>
     be welcomed home. Then another and another peal, or rather crashing,
    </p>
    <p>
     splintering stroke, follows in quick succession, perchance splitting some giant
    </p>
    <p>
     pine or fir from top to bottom into long rails and slivers, and scattering them to
    </p>
    <p>
     all points of the compass. Now comes the rain, with corresponding extravagant
    </p>
    <p>
     grandeur, covering the ground high and low with a sheet of flowing water, a
    </p>
    <p>
     transparent film fitted like a skin upon the rugged anatomy of the landscape,
    </p>
    <p>
     making the rocks glitter and glow, gathering in the ravines, flooding the
    </p>
    <p>
     streams, and making them shout and boom in reply to the thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
     How interesting to trace the history of a single raindrop! It is not long,
    </p>
    <p>
     geologically speaking, as we have seen, since the first raindrops fell on the
    </p>
    <p>
     newborn leafless Sierra land scapes. How different the lot of these falling now!
    </p>
    <p>
     Happy the showers that fall on so fair a wilderness,—scarce a single drop can
    </p>
    <p>
     fail to find a beautiful spot,—on the tops of the peaks, on the shining glacier
    </p>
    <p>
     pavements, on the great smooth domes, on forests and gardens and brushy
    </p>
    <p>
     moraines, plashing, glinting, pattering, laving. Some go to the high snowy
    </p>
    <p>
     fountains to swell their well-saved stores; some into the lakes, washing the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain windows, patting their smooth glassy levels, making dimples and
    </p>
    <p>
     bubbles and spray; some into the waterfalls and cascades, as if eager to join in
    </p>
    <p>
     their dance and song and beat their foam yet finer; good luck and good work
    </p>
    <p>
     for the happy mountain raindrops, each one of them a high waterfall in itself,
    </p>
    <p>
     descending from the cliffs and hollows of the clouds to the cliffs and hollows of
    </p>
    <p>
     the rocks, out of the sky-thunder into the thunder of the falling rivers. Some,
    </p>
    <p>
     falling on meadows and bogs, creep silently out of sight to the grass roots,
    </p>
    <p>
     hiding softly as in a nest, slipping, oozing hither, thither, seeking and finding
    </p>
    <p>
     their appointed work. Some, descending through the spires of the woods, sift
    </p>
    <p>
     spray through the shining needles, whispering peace and good cheer to each
    </p>
    <p>
     one of them. Some drops with happy aim glint on the sides of crystals,—quartz,
    </p>
    <p>
     hornblende, garnet, zir con, tourmaline, feldspar,—patter on grains of gold and
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy way-worn nuggets; some, with blunt plap-plap and low bass drumming,
    </p>
    <p>
     fall on the broad leaves of veratrum, saxifrage, cypripedium. Some happy drops
    </p>
    <p>
     fall straight into the cups of flowers, kissing the lips of lilies. How far they have
    </p>
    <p>
     to go, how many cups to fill, great and small, cells too small to be seen, cups
    </p>
    <p>
     holding half a drop as well as lake basins between the hills, each replenished
    </p>
    <p>
     with equal care, every drop in all the blessed throng a silvery newborn star with
    </p>
    <p>
     lake and river, garden and grove, valley and mountain, all that the landscape
    </p>
    <p>
     holds reflected in its crystal depths, God's messenger, angel of love sent on its
    </p>
    <p>
     way with majesty and pomp and display of power that make man's greatest
    </p>
    <p>
     shows ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the storm is over, the sky is clear, the last rolling thunder-wave is spent
    </p>
    <p>
     on the peaks, and where are the raindrops now—what has become of all the
    </p>
    <p>
     shining throng? In winged vapor rising some are already hastening back to the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky, some have gone into the plants, creeping through invisible doors into the
    </p>
    <p>
     round rooms of cells, some are locked in crystals of ice, some in rock crystals,
    </p>
    <p>
     some in porous moraines to keep their small springs flowing, some have gone
    </p>
    <p>
     journeying on in the rivers to join the larger raindrop of the ocean. From form
    </p>
    <p>
     to form, beauty to beauty, ever changing, never resting, all are speeding on
    </p>
    <p>
     with love's enthusiasm, singing with the stars the eternal song of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Fine calm morning; air tense and clear; not the slightest breeze astir;
    </p>
    <p>
     everything shining, the rocks with wet crystals, the plants with dew, each
    </p>
    <p>
     receiving its portion of irised dewdrops and sunshine like living creatures
    </p>
    <p>
     getting their breakfast, their dew manna coming down from the starry sky like
    </p>
    <p>
     swarms of smaller stars. How wondrous fine are the particles in showers of
    </p>
    <p>
     dew, thousands required for a single drop, growing in the dark as silently as
    </p>
    <p>
     the grass! What pains are taken to keep this wilderness in health,—showers of
    </p>
    <p>
     snow, showers of rain, showers of dew, floods of light, floods of invisible vapor,
    </p>
    <p>
     clouds, winds, all sorts of weather, interaction of plant on plant, animal on
    </p>
    <p>
     animal, etc., beyond thought! How fine Nature's methods! How deeply with
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty is beauty overlaid! the ground covered with crystals, the crystals with
    </p>
    <p>
     mosses and lichens and low-spreading grasses and flowers, these with larger
    </p>
    <p>
     plants leaf over leaf with ever-changing color and form, the broad palms of the
    </p>
    <p>
     firs outspread over these, the azure dome over all like a bell-flower, and star
    </p>
    <p>
     above star.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yonder stands the South Dome, its crown high above our camp, though its
    </p>
    <p>
     base is four thousand feet below us; a most noble rock, it seems full of
    </p>
    <p>
     thought, clothed with living light, no sense of dead stone about it, all
    </p>
    <p>
     spiritualized, neither heavy looking nor light, steadfast in serene strength like a
    </p>
    <p>
     god.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our shepherd is a queer character and hard to place in this wilderness. His
    </p>
    <p>
     bed is a hollow made in red dry-rot punky dust beside a log which forms a
    </p>
    <p>
     portion of the south wall of the corral. Here he lies with his wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     everlasting clothing on, wrapped in a red blanket, breathing not only the dust
    </p>
    <p>
     of the decayed wood but also that of the corral, as if determined to take
    </p>
    <p>
     ammoniacal snuff all night after chewing tobacco all day. Following the sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     he carries a heavy six-shooter swung from his belt on one side and his
    </p>
    <p>
     luncheon on the other. The ancient cloth in which the meat, fresh from the
    </p>
    <p>
     frying-pan, is tied serves as a filter through which the clear fat and gravy juices
    </p>
    <p>
     drip down on his right hip and leg in clustering stalactites. This oleaginous
    </p>
    <p>
     formation is soon broken up, however, and diffused and rubbed evenly into his
    </p>
    <p>
     scanty apparel, by sitting down, rolling over, crossing his legs while resting on
    </p>
    <p>
     logs, etc., making shirt and trousers water-tight and shiny. His trousers, in
    </p>
    <p>
     parti cular, have become so adhesive with the mixed fat and resin that pine
    </p>
    <p>
     needles, thin flakes and fibres of bark, hair, mica scales and minute grains of
    </p>
    <p>
     quartz, hornblende, etc., feathers, seed wings, moth and butterfly wings, legs
    </p>
    <p>
     and antennæ of innumerable insects, or even whole insects such as the small
    </p>
    <p>
     beetles, moths and mosquitoes, with flower petals, pollen dust and indeed bits
    </p>
    <p>
     of all plants, animals, and minerals of the region adhere to them and are safely
    </p>
    <p>
     imbedded, so that though far from being a naturalist he collects fragmentary
    </p>
    <p>
     specimens of everything and becomes richer than he knows. His specimens are
    </p>
    <p>
     kept passably fresh, too, by the purity of the air and the resiny bituminous
    </p>
    <p>
     beds into which they are pressed. Man is a microcosm, at least our shepherd
    </p>
    <p>
     is, or rather his trousers. These precious overalls are never taken off, and
    </p>
    <p>
     nobody knows how old they are, though one may guess by their thickness and
    </p>
    <p>
     concentric structure. Instead of wearing thin they wear thick, and in their
    </p>
    <p>
     stratification have no small geological significance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides herding the sheep, Billy is the butcher, while I have agreed to wash the
    </p>
    <p>
     few iron and tin utensils and make the bread. Then, these small duties done,
    </p>
    <p>
     by the time the sun is fairly above the mountain-tops I am beyond the flock,
    </p>
    <p>
     free to rove and revel in the wilderness all the big immortal days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sketching on the North Dome. It commands views of nearly all the valley
    </p>
    <p>
     besides a few of the high mountains. I would fain draw everything in sight—
    </p>
    <p>
     rock, tree, and leaf. But little can I do beyond mere outlines,—marks with
    </p>
    <p>
     meanings like words, readable only to myself,—yet I sharpen my pencils and
    </p>
    <p>
     work on as if others might possibly be benefited. Whether these picture-sheets
    </p>
    <p>
     are to vanish like fallen leaves or go to friends like letters, matters not much;
    </p>
    <p>
     for little can they tell to those who have not themselves seen similar wildness,
    </p>
    <p>
     and like a language have learned it. No pain here, no dull empty hours, no fear
    </p>
    <p>
     of the past, no fear of the future. These blessed mountains are so compactly
    </p>
    <p>
     filled with God's beauty, no petty personal hope or experience has room to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Drinking this champagne water is pure pleasure, so is breathing the living air,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every movement of limbs is pleasure, while the whole body seems to feel
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty when exposed to it as it feels the camp-fire or sunshine, entering not by
    </p>
    <p>
     the eyes alone, but equally through all one's flesh like radiant heat, making a
    </p>
    <p>
     passionate ecstatic pleasure-glow not explainable. One's body then seems
    </p>
    <p>
     homogeneous throughout, sound as a crystal. Perched like a fly on this
    </p>
    <p>
     Yosemite dome, I gaze and sketch and bask, oftentimes settling down into
    </p>
    <p>
     dumb admiration without definite hope of ever learning much, yet with the
    </p>
    <p>
     longing, unresting effort that lies at the door of hope, humbly prostrate before
    </p>
    <p>
     the vast display of God's power, and eager to offer self-denial and renunciation
    </p>
    <p>
     with eternal toil to learn any lesson in the divine manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is easier to feel than to realize, or in any way explain, Yosemite grandeur. The
    </p>
    <p>
     magnitudes of the rocks and trees and streams are so delicately harmonized
    </p>
    <p>
     they are mostly hidden. Sheer precipices three thousand feet high are fringed
    </p>
    <p>
     with tall trees growing close like grass on the brow of a lowland hill, and
    </p>
    <p>
     extending along the feet of these precipices a ribbon of meadow a mile wide and
    </p>
    <p>
     seven or eight long, that seems like a strip a farmer might mow in less than a
    </p>
    <p>
     day. Waterfalls, five hundred to one or two thousand feet high, are so
    </p>
    <p>
     subordinated to the mighty cliffs over which they pour that they seem like
    </p>
    <p>
     wisps of smoke, gentle as floating clouds, though their voices fill the valley and
    </p>
    <p>
     make the rocks tremble. The mountains, too, along the eastern sky, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     domes in front of them, and the succession of smooth rounded waves between,
    </p>
    <p>
     swelling higher, higher, with dark woods in their hollows, serene in massive
    </p>
    <p>
     exuberant bulk and beauty, tend yet more to hide the grandeur of the Yosemite
    </p>
    <p>
     temple and make it appear as a subdued subordinate feature of the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     harmonious landscape. Thus every attempt to appreciate any one feature is
    </p>
    <p>
     beaten down by the overwhelming influence of all the others. And, as if this
    </p>
    <p>
     were not enough, lo! in the sky arises another mountain range with topography
    </p>
    <p>
     as rugged and substantial-looking as the one beneath it—snowy peaks and
    </p>
    <p>
     domes and shadowy Yosemite valleys—another version of the snowy Sierra, a
    </p>
    <p>
     new creation heralded by a thunder-storm. How fiercely, devoutly wild is
    </p>
    <p>
     Nature in the midst of her beauty-loving tenderness!—painting lilies, watering
    </p>
    <p>
     them, caressing them with gentle hand, going from flower to flower like a
    </p>
    <p>
     gardener while building rock mountains and cloud mountains full of lightning
    </p>
    <p>
     and rain. Gladly we run for shelter beneath an overhanging cliff and examine
    </p>
    <p>
     the reassuring ferns and mosses, gentle love tokens growing in cracks and
    </p>
    <p>
     chinks. Daisies, too, and ivesias, confiding wild children of light, too small to
    </p>
    <p>
     fear. To these one's heart goes home, and the voices of the storm become
    </p>
    <p>
     gentle. Now the sun breaks forth and fragrant steam arises. The birds are out
    </p>
    <p>
     singing on the edges of the groves. The west is flaming in gold and purple,
    </p>
    <p>
     ready for the ceremony of the sunset, and back I go to camp with my notes and
    </p>
    <p>
     pictures, the best of them printed in my mind as dreams. A fruitful day,
    </p>
    <p>
     without measured beginning or ending. A terrestrial eternity. A gift of good
    </p>
    <p>
     God.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wrote to my mother and a few friends, mountain hints to each. They seem as
    </p>
    <p>
     near as if within voice-reach or touch. The deeper the solitude the less the
    </p>
    <p>
     sense of loneliness, and the nearer our friends. Now bread and tea, fir bed and
    </p>
    <p>
     good-night to Carlo, a look at the sky lilies, and death sleep until the dawn of
    </p>
    <p>
     another Sierra to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Sketching on the Dome—no rain; clouds at noon about quarter filled the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky, casting shadows with fine effect on the white mountains at the heads of
    </p>
    <p>
     the streams, and a soothing cover over the gardens during the warm hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Saw a common house-fly and a grasshopper and a brown bear. The fly and
    </p>
    <p>
     grasshopper paid me a merry visit on the top of the Dome, and I paid a visit to
    </p>
    <p>
     the bear in the middle of a small garden meadow between the Dome and the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp where he was standing alert among the flowers as if willing to be seen to
    </p>
    <p>
     advantage. I had not gone more than half a mile from camp this morning,
    </p>
    <p>
     when Carlo, who was trotting on a few yards ahead of me, came to a sudden,
    </p>
    <p>
     cautious standstill. Down went tail and ears, and forward went his knowing
    </p>
    <p>
     nose, while he seemed to be saying, "Ha, what's this? A bear, I guess." Then a
    </p>
    <p>
     cautious advance of a few steps, setting his feet down softly like a hunting cat,
    </p>
    <p>
     and questioning the air as to the scent he had caught until all doubt vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he came back to me, looked me in the face, and with his speaking eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     reported a bear near by; then led on softly, careful, like an experienced hunter,
    </p>
    <p>
     not to make the slightest noise; and frequently looking back as if whispering,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, it's a bear; come and I'll show you." Presently we came to where the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunbeams were streaming through between the purple shafts of the firs, which
    </p>
    <p>
     showed that we were nearing an open spot, and here Carlo came behind me,
    </p>
    <p>
     evidently sure that the bear was very near. So I crept to a low ridge of moraine
    </p>
    <p>
     boulders on the edge of a narrow garden meadow, and in this meadow I felt
    </p>
    <p>
     pretty sure the bear must be. I was anxious to get a good look at the sturdy
    </p>
    <p>
     mountaineer without alarming him; so drawing myself up noiselessly back of
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the largest of the trees I peered past its bulging buttresses, exposing
    </p>
    <p>
     only a part of my head, and there stood neighbor Bruin within a stone's throw,
    </p>
    <p>
     his hips covered by tall grass and flowers, and his front feet on the trunk of a
    </p>
    <p>
     fir that had fallen out into the meadow, which raised his head so high that he
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to be standing erect. He had not yet seen me, but was looking and
    </p>
    <p>
     listening attentively, showing that in some way he was aware of our approach. I
    </p>
    <p>
     watched his gestures and tried to make the most of my opportunity to learn
    </p>
    <p>
     what I could about him, fearing he would catch sight of me and run away. For I
    </p>
    <p>
     had been told that this sort of bear, the cinnamon, always ran from his bad
    </p>
    <p>
     brother man, never showing fight unless wounded or in defense of young. He
    </p>
    <p>
     made a telling picture standing alert in the sunny forest garden. How well he
    </p>
    <p>
     played his part, harmonizing in bulk and color and shaggy hair with the trunks
    </p>
    <p>
     of the trees and lush vegetation, as natural a feature as any other in the
    </p>
    <p>
     landscape. After examining at leisure, noting the sharp muzzle thrust
    </p>
    <p>
     inquiringly forward, the long shaggy hair on his broad chest, the stiff, erect
    </p>
    <p>
     ears nearly buried in hair, and the slow, heavy way he moved his head, I
    </p>
    <p>
     thought I should like to see his gait in running, so I made a sudden rush at
    </p>
    <p>
     him, shouting and swinging my hat to frighten him, expecting to see him make
    </p>
    <p>
     haste to get away. But to my dismay he did not run or show any sign of
    </p>
    <p>
     running. On the contrary, he stood his ground ready to fight and defend
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, lowered his head, thrust it forward, and looked sharply and fiercely at
    </p>
    <p>
     me. Then I suddenly began to fear that upon me would fall the work of
    </p>
    <p>
     running; but I was afraid to run, and therefore, like the bear, held my ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     We stood staring at each other in solemn silence within a dozen yards or
    </p>
    <p>
     thereabouts, while I fervently hoped that the power of the human eye over wild
    </p>
    <p>
     beasts would prove as great as it is said to be. How long our awfully strenuous
    </p>
    <p>
     interview lasted, I don't know; but at length in the slow fullness of time he
    </p>
    <p>
     pulled his huge paws down off the log, and with magnificent deliberation
    </p>
    <p>
     turned and walked leisurely up the meadow, stopping frequently to look back
    </p>
    <p>
     over his shoulder to see whether I was pursuing him, then moving on again,
    </p>
    <p>
     evidently neither fearing me very much nor trusting me. He was probably about
    </p>
    <p>
     five hundred pounds in weight, a broad, rusty bundle of ungovernable
    </p>
    <p>
     wildness, a happy fellow whose lines have fallen in pleasant places. The flowery
    </p>
    <p>
     glade in which I saw him so well, framed like a picture, is one of the best of all I
    </p>
    <p>
     have yet discovered, a conservatory of Nature's precious plant people. Tall lilies
    </p>
    <p>
     were swinging their bells over that bear's back, with geraniums, larkspurs,
    </p>
    <p>
     columbines, and daisies brushing against his sides. A place for angels, one
    </p>
    <p>
     would say, instead of bears.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the great cañons Bruin reigns supreme. Happy fellow, whom no famine can
    </p>
    <p>
     reach while one of his thousand kinds of food is spared him. His bread is sure
    </p>
    <p>
     at all seasons, ranged on the mountain shelves like stores in a pantry. From
    </p>
    <p>
     one to the other, up or down he climbs, tasting and enjoying each in turn in
    </p>
    <p>
     different climates, as if he had journeyed thousands of miles to other countries
    </p>
    <p>
     north or south to enjoy their varied productions. I should like to know my hairy
    </p>
    <p>
     brothers better—though after this particular Yosemite bear, my very neighbor,
    </p>
    <p>
     had sauntered out of sight this morning, I reluctantly went back to camp for
    </p>
    <p>
     the Don's rifle to shoot him, if necessary, in defense of the flock. Fortunately I
    </p>
    <p>
     couldn't find him, and after tracking him a mile or two towards Mount Hoffman
    </p>
    <p>
     I bade him Godspeed and gladly returned to my work on the Yosemite Dome.
    </p>
    <p>
     The house-fly also seemed at home and buzzed about me as I sat sketching,
    </p>
    <p>
     and enjoying my bear interview now it was over. I wonder what draws house-
    </p>
    <p>
     flies so far up the mountains, heavy gross feeders as they are, sensitive to
    </p>
    <p>
     cold, and fond of domestic ease. How have they been distributed from continent
    </p>
    <p>
     to continent, across seas and deserts and mountain chains, usually so
    </p>
    <p>
     influential in determining boundaries of species both of plants and animals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beetles and butterflies are sometimes restricted to small areas. Each mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     in a range, and even the different zones of a mountain, may have its own
    </p>
    <p>
     peculiar species. But the house-fly seems to be everywhere. I wonder if any
    </p>
    <p>
     island in mid-ocean is flyless. The bluebottle is abundant in these Yosemite
    </p>
    <p>
     woods, ever ready with his marvelous store of eggs to make all dead flesh fly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bumblebees are here, and are well fed on boundless stores of nectar and
    </p>
    <p>
     pollen. The honeybee, though abundant in the foothills, has not yet got so high.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is only a few years since the first swarm was brought to California.
    </p>
    <p>
     TRACK OF SINGING DANCING GRASSHOPPER IN THE AIR OVER NORTH
    </p>
    <p>
     DOME
    </p>
    <p>
     A queer fellow and a jolly fellow is the grasshopper. Up the mountains he
    </p>
    <p>
     comes on excursions, how high I don't know, but at least as far and high as
    </p>
    <p>
     Yosemite tourists. I was much interested with the hearty enjoyment of the one
    </p>
    <p>
     that danced and sang for me on the Dome this afternoon. He seemed brimful of
    </p>
    <p>
     glad, hilarious energy, manifested by springing into the air to a height of
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty or thirty feet, then diving and springing up again and making a sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     musical rattle just as the lowest point in the descent was reached. Up and
    </p>
    <p>
     down a dozen times or so he danced and sang, then alighted to rest, then up
    </p>
    <p>
     and at it again. The curves he described in the air in diving and rattling
    </p>
    <p>
     resembled those made by cords hanging loosely and attached at the same
    </p>
    <p>
     height at the ends, the loops nearly covering each other. Braver, heartier,
    </p>
    <p>
     keener, care-free enjoyment of life I have never seen or heard in any creature,
    </p>
    <p>
     great or small. The life of this comic redlegs, the mountain's merriest child,
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to be made up of pure, condensed gayety. The Douglas squirrel is the
    </p>
    <p>
     only living creature that I can compare him with in exuberant, rollicking,
    </p>
    <p>
     irrepressible jollity. Wonderful that these sublime mountains are so loudly
    </p>
    <p>
     cheered and brightened by a creature so queer. Nature in him seems to be
    </p>
    <p>
     snapping her fingers in the face of all earthly dejection and melancholy with a
    </p>
    <p>
     boyish hip-hip-hurrah. How the sound is made I do not understand. When he
    </p>
    <p>
     was on the ground he made not the slightest noise, nor when he was simply
    </p>
    <p>
     flying from place to place, but only when diving in curves, the motion seeming
    </p>
    <p>
     to be required for the sound; for the more vigorous the diving the more ener
    </p>
    <p>
     getic the corresponding outbursts of jolly rattling. I tried to observe him closely
    </p>
    <p>
     while he was resting in the intervals of his performances; but he would not
    </p>
    <p>
     allow a near approach, always getting his jumping legs ready to spring for
    </p>
    <p>
     immediate flight, and keeping his eyes on me. A fine sermon the little fellow
    </p>
    <p>
     danced for me on the Dome, a likely place to look for sermons in stones, but
    </p>
    <p>
     not for grasshopper sermons. A large and imposing pulpit for so small a
    </p>
    <p>
     preacher. No danger of weakness in the knees of the world while Nature can
    </p>
    <p>
     spring such a rattle as this. Even the bear did not express for me the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain's wild health and strength and happiness so tellingly as did this
    </p>
    <p>
     comical little hopper. No cloud of care in his day, no winter of discontent in
    </p>
    <p>
     sight. To him every day is a holiday; and when at length his sun sets, I fancy
    </p>
    <p>
     he will cuddle down on the forest floor and die like the leaves and flowers, and
    </p>
    <p>
     like them leave no unsightly remains calling for burial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sundown, and I must to camp. Good-night, friends three,—brown bear, rugged
    </p>
    <p>
     boulder of energy in groves and gardens fair as Eden; restless, fussy fly with
    </p>
    <p>
     gauzy wings stirring the air around all the world; and grasshopper, crisp,
    </p>
    <p>
     electric spark of joy enlivening the massy sublimity of the mountains like the
    </p>
    <p>
     laugh of a child. Thank you, thank you all three for your quickening company.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heaven guide every wing and leg. Good-night friends three, good-night.

    <p>
     July . A fine specimen of the black-tailed deer went bounding past camp this
    </p>
    <p>
     morning. A buck with wide spread of antlers, showing admirable vigor and
    </p>
    <p>
     grace. Wonderful the beauty, strength, and graceful movements of animals in
    </p>
    <p>
     wildernesses, cared for by Nature only, when our experience with domestic
    </p>
    <p>
     animals would lead us to fear that all the so-called neglected wild beasts would
    </p>
    <p>
     degenerate. Yet the upshot of Nature's method of breeding and teaching seems
    </p>
    <p>
     to lead to excellence of every sort. Deer, like all wild animals, are as clean as
    </p>
    <p>
     plants. The beauties of their gestures and attitudes, alert or in repose, surprise
    </p>
    <p>
     yet more than their bounding exuberant strength. Every movement and
    </p>
    <p>
     posture is graceful, the very poetry of manners and motion. Mother Nature is
    </p>
    <p>
     too often spoken of as in reality no mother at all. Yet how wisely, sternly,
    </p>
    <p>
     tenderly she loves and looks after her children in all sorts of weather and
    </p>
    <p>
     wildernesses. The more I see of deer the more I admire them as mountaineers.
    </p>
    <p>
     They make their way into the heart of the roughest solitudes with smooth
    </p>
    <p>
     reserve of strength, through dense belts of brush and for est encumbered with
    </p>
    <p>
     fallen trees and boulder piles, across cañons, roaring streams, and snow-fields,
    </p>
    <p>
     ever showing forth beauty and courage. Over nearly all the continent the deer
    </p>
    <p>
     find homes. In the Florida savannas and hummocks, in the Canada woods, in
    </p>
    <p>
     the far north, roaming over mossy tundras, swimming lakes and rivers and
    </p>
    <p>
     arms of the sea from island to island washed with waves, or climbing rocky
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains, everywhere healthy and able, adding beauty to every landscape,—a
    </p>
    <p>
     truly admirable creature and great credit to Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Have been sketching a silver fir that stands on a granite ridge a few hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     yards to the eastward of camp—a fine tree with a particular snow-storm story
    </p>
    <p>
     to tell. It is about one hundred feet high, growing on bare rock, thrusting its
    </p>
    <p>
     roots into a weathered joint less than an inch wide, and bulging out to form a
    </p>
    <p>
     base to bear its weight. The storm came from the north while it was young and
    </p>
    <p>
     broke it down nearly to the ground, as is shown by the old, dead, weatherbeaten top leaning out from the living trunk built up from a new shoot below
    </p>
    <p>
     the break. The annual rings of the trunk that have overgrown the dead sapling
    </p>
    <p>
     tell the year of the storm. Wonderful that a side branch forming a portion of
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the level collars that encircle the trunk of this species Abies magnifica
    </p>
    <p>
     should bend upward, grow erect, and take the place of the lost axis to form a
    </p>
    <p>
     new tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many others, pines as well as firs, bear testimony to the crushing severity of
    </p>
    <p>
     this particular storm. Trees, some of them fifty to seventy-five feet high, were
    </p>
    <p>
     bent to the ground and buried like grass, whole groves vanishing as if the
    </p>
    <p>
     forest had been cleared away, leaving not a branch or needle visible until the
    </p>
    <p>
     spring thaw. Then the more elastic undamaged saplings rose again, aided by
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind, some reaching a nearly erect attitude, others remaining more or less
    </p>
    <p>
     bent, while those with broken backs endeavored to specialize a side branch
    </p>
    <p>
     below the break and make a leader of it to form a new axis of development. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     as if a man, whose back was broken or nearly so and who was compelled to go
    </p>
    <p>
     bent, should find a branch backbone sprouting straight up from below the
    </p>
    <p>
     break and should gradually develop new arms and shoulders and head, while
    </p>
    <p>
     the old damaged portion of his body died.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grand white cloud mountains and domes created about noon as usual, ridges
    </p>
    <p>
     and ranges of endless variety, as if Nature dearly loved this sort of work, doing
    </p>
    <p>
     it again and again nearly every day with infinite industry, and producing
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty that never palls. A few zig zags of lightning, five minutes' shower, then a
    </p>
    <p>
     gradual wilting and clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     ILLUSTRATING GROWTH OF NEW PINE FROM BRANCH BELOW THE
    </p>
    <p>
     BREAK OF AXIS OF SNOW-CRUSHED TREE
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Another midday cloudland, displaying power and beauty that one never
    </p>
    <p>
     wearies in beholding, but hopelessly unsketchable and untellable. What can
    </p>
    <p>
     poor mortals say about clouds? While a description of their huge glowing
    </p>
    <p>
     domes and ridges, shadowy gulfs and cañons, and feather-edged ravines is
    </p>
    <p>
     being tried, they vanish, leaving no visible ruins. Nevertheless, these fleeting
    </p>
    <p>
     sky mountains are as substantial and significant as the more lasting upheavals
    </p>
    <p>
     of granite beneath them. Both alike are built up and die, and in God's calendar
    </p>
    <p>
     difference of duration is nothing. We can only dream about them in wondering,
    </p>
    <p>
     worshiping admiration, happier than we dare tell even to friends who see
    </p>
    <p>
     farthest in sympathy, glad to know that not a crystal or vapor particle of them,
    </p>
    <p>
     hard or soft, is lost; that they sink and vanish only to rise again and again in
    </p>
    <p>
     higher and higher beauty. As to our own work, duty, influence, etc., concerning
    </p>
    <p>
     which so much fussy pother is made, it will not fail of its due effect, though,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a lichen on a stone, we keep silent.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Clouds at noon occupying about half the sky gave half an hour of heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     rain to wash one of the cleanest landscapes in the world. How well it is
    </p>
    <p>
     washed! The sea is hardly less dusty than the ice-burnished pavements and
    </p>
    <p>
     ridges, domes and cañons, and summit peaks plashed with snow like waves
    </p>
    <p>
     with foam. How fresh the woods are and calm after the last films of clouds have
    </p>
    <p>
     been wiped from the sky! A few minutes ago every tree was excited, bowing to
    </p>
    <p>
     the roaring storm, waving, swirling, tossing their branches in glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     enthusiasm like worship. But though to the outer ear these trees are now
    </p>
    <p>
     silent, their songs never cease. Every hidden cell is throbbing with music and
    </p>
    <p>
     life, every fibre thrilling like harp strings, while incense is ever flowing from the
    </p>
    <p>
     balsam bells and leaves. No wonder the hills and groves were God's first
    </p>
    <p>
     temples, and the more they are cut down and hewn into cathedrals and
    </p>
    <p>
     churches, the farther off and dimmer seems the Lord himself. The same may be
    </p>
    <p>
     said of stone temples. Yonder, to the eastward of our camp grove, stands one of
    </p>
    <p>
     Nature's cathedrals, hewn from the living rock, almost conventional in form,
    </p>
    <p>
     about two thousand feet high, nobly adorned with spires and pinnacles,
    </p>
    <p>
     thrilling under floods of sunshine as if alive like a grove-temple, and well
    </p>
    <p>
     named "Cathedral Peak." Even Shepherd Billy turns at times to this wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain building, though apparently deaf to all stone sermons. Snow that re
    </p>
    <p>
     fused to melt in fire would hardly be more wonderful than unchanging dullness
    </p>
    <p>
     in the rays of God's beauty. I have been trying to get him to walk to the brink of
    </p>
    <p>
     Yosemite for a view, offering to watch the sheep for a day, while he should
    </p>
    <p>
     enjoy what tourists come from all over the world to see. But though within a
    </p>
    <p>
     mile of the famous valley, he will not go to it even out of mere curiosity. "What,"
    </p>
    <p>
     says he, "is Yosemite but a cañon—a lot of rocks—a hole in the ground—a
    </p>
    <p>
     place dangerous about falling into—a d——d good place to keep away from."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But think of the waterfalls, Billy—just think of that big stream we crossed the
    </p>
    <p>
     other day, falling half a mile through the air—think of that, and the sound it
    </p>
    <p>
     makes. You can hear it now like the roar of the sea." Thus I pressed Yosemite
    </p>
    <p>
     upon him like a missionary offering the gospel, but he would have none of it. "I
    </p>
    <p>
     should be afraid to look over so high a wall," he said. "It would make my head
    </p>
    <p>
     swim. There is nothing worth seeing anywhere, only rocks, and I see plenty of
    </p>
    <p>
     them here. Tourists that spend their money to see rocks and falls are fools,
    </p>
    <p>
     that's all. You can't humbug me. I've been in this country too long for that."
    </p>
    <p>
     Such souls, I suppose, are asleep, or smothered and befogged beneath mean
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasures and cares.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Another cloudland. Some clouds have an over-ripe decaying look, watery
    </p>
    <p>
     and bedraggled and drawn out into wind-torn shreds and patches, giving the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky a littered appearance; not so these Sierra summer midday clouds. All are
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful with smooth definite outlines and curves like those of glacier-polished
    </p>
    <p>
     domes. They begin to grow about eleven o'clock, and seem so wonderfully near
    </p>
    <p>
     and clear from this high camp one is tempted to try to climb them and trace
    </p>
    <p>
     the streams that pour like cataracts from their shadowy fountains. The rain to
    </p>
    <p>
     which they give birth is often very heavy, a sort of waterfall as imposing as if
    </p>
    <p>
     pouring from rock mountains. Never in all my travels have I found anything
    </p>
    <p>
     more truly novel and interesting than these midday mountains of the sky, their
    </p>
    <p>
     fine tones of color, majestic visible growth, and ever-changing scenery and
    </p>
    <p>
     general effects, though mostly as well let alone as far as description goes. I
    </p>
    <p>
     oftentimes think of Shelley's cloud poem, "I sift the snow on the mountains
    </p>
    <p>
     below."

    <p>
     MOUNT HOFFMAN AND LAKE TENAYA
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Ramble to the summit of Mount Hoffman, eleven thousand feet high, the
    </p>
    <p>
     highest point in life's journey my feet have yet touched. And what glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     landscapes are about me, new plants, new animals, new crystals, and
    </p>
    <p>
     multitudes of new mountains far higher than Hoffman, towering in glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     array along the axis of the range, serene, majestic, snow-laden, sun-drenched,
    </p>
    <p>
     vast domes and ridges shining below them, forests, lakes, and meadows in the
    </p>
    <p>
     hollows, the pure blue bell-flower sky brooding them all,—a glory day of
    </p>
    <p>
     admission into a new realm of wonders as if Nature had wooingly whispered,
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come higher." What questions I asked, and how little I know of all the vast
    </p>
    <p>
     show, and how eagerly, tremulously hopeful of some day knowing more,
    </p>
    <p>
     learning the meaning of these divine symbols crowded together on this
    </p>
    <p>
     wondrous page.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mount Hoffman is the highest part of a ridge or spur about fourteen miles from
    </p>
    <p>
     the axis of the main range, perhaps a remnant brought into relief and isolated
    </p>
    <p>
     by unequal denudation. The southern slopes shed their waters into Yosemite
    </p>
    <p>
     Valley by Tenaya and Dome Creeks, the northern in part into the Tuolumne
    </p>
    <p>
     River, but mostly into the Merced by Yosemite Creek. The rock is mostly
    </p>
    <p>
     granite, with some small piles and crests rising here and there in picturesque
    </p>
    <p>
     pillared and castellated remnants of red metamorphic slates. Both the granite
    </p>
    <p>
     and slates are divided by joints, making them separable into blocks like the
    </p>
    <p>
     stones of artificial masonry, suggesting the Scripture "He hath builded the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains." Great banks of snow and ice are piled in hollows on the cool
    </p>
    <p>
     precipitous north side forming the highest perennial sources of Yosemite Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
     The southern slopes are much more gradual and accessible. Narrow slot-like
    </p>
    <p>
     gorges extend across the summit at right angles, which look like lanes, formed
    </p>
    <p>
     evidently by the erosion of less resisting beds. They are usually called "devil's
    </p>
    <p>
     slides," though they lie far above the region usually haunted by the devil; for
    </p>
    <p>
     though we read that he once climbed an exceeding high mountain, he cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     be much of a mountaineer, for his tracks are seldom seen above the timberline.
    </p>
    <p>
     APPROACH OF DOME CREEK TO YOSEMITE
    </p>
    <p>
     The broad gray summit is barren and desolate-looking in general views, wasted
    </p>
    <p>
     by ages of gnawing storms; but looking at the surface in detail, one finds it
    </p>
    <p>
     covered by thousands and millions of charming plants with leaves and flowers
    </p>
    <p>
     so small they form no mass of color visible at a distance of a few hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     yards. Beds of azure daisies smile confidingly in moist hollows, and along the
    </p>
    <p>
     banks of small rills, with several species of eriogonum, silky-leaved ivesia,
    </p>
    <p>
     pentstemon, orthocarpus, and patches of Primula suffruticosa, a beautiful
    </p>
    <p>
     shrubby species. Here also I found bryanthus, a charming heathwort covered
    </p>
    <p>
     with purple flowers and dark green foliage like heather, and three trees new to
    </p>
    <p>
     me—a hemlock and two pines. The hemlock Tsuga Mertensiana is the most
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful conifer I have ever seen; the branches and also the main axis droop in
    </p>
    <p>
     a singularly graceful way, and the dense foliage covers the delicate, sensitive,
    </p>
    <p>
     swaying branchlets all around. It is now in full bloom, and the flowers, together
    </p>
    <p>
     with thousands of last season's cones still clinging to the drooping sprays,
    </p>
    <p>
     display wonderful wealth of color, brown and purple and blue. Gladly I climbed
    </p>
    <p>
     the first tree I found to revel in the midst of it. How the touch of the flowers
    </p>
    <p>
     makes one's flesh tingle! The pistillate are dark, rich purple, and almost
    </p>
    <p>
     translucent, the staminate blue,—a vivid, pure tone of blue like the mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     sky,—the most uncommonly beautiful of all the Sierra tree flowers I have seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     How wonder ful that, with all its delicate feminine grace and beauty of form
    </p>
    <p>
     and dress and behavior, this lovely tree up here, exposed to the wildest blasts,
    </p>
    <p>
     has already endured the storms of centuries of winters!
    </p>
    <p>
     The two pines also are brave storm-enduring trees, the mountain pine Pinus
    </p>
    <p>
     monticola and the dwarf pine Pinus albicaulis. The mountain pine is closely
    </p>
    <p>
     related to the sugar pine, though the cones are only about four to six inches
    </p>
    <p>
     long. The largest trees are from five to six feet in diameter at four feet above the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground, the bark rich brown. Only a few storm-beaten adventurers approach
    </p>
    <p>
     the summit of the mountain. The dwarf or white-bark pine is the species that
    </p>
    <p>
     forms the timber-line, where it is so completely dwarfed that one may walk over
    </p>
    <p>
     the top of a bed of it as over snow-pressed chaparral.
    </p>
    <p>
     How boundless the day seems as we revel in these storm-beaten sky gardens
    </p>
    <p>
     amid so vast a congregation of onlooking mountains! Strange and admirable it
    </p>
    <p>
     is that the more savage and chilly and storm-chafed the mountains, the finer
    </p>
    <p>
     the glow on their faces and the finer the plants they bear. The myriads of
    </p>
    <p>
     flowers tingeing the mountain-top do not seem to have grown out of the dry,
    </p>
    <p>
     rough gravel of disintegration, but rather they appear as visi tors, a cloud of
    </p>
    <p>
     witnesses to Nature's love in what we in our timid ignorance and unbelief call
    </p>
    <p>
     howling desert. The surface of the ground, so dull and forbidding at first sight,
    </p>
    <p>
     besides being rich in plants, shines and sparkles with crystals: mica,
    </p>
    <p>
     hornblende, feldspar, quartz, tourmaline. The radiance in some places is so
    </p>
    <p>
     great as to be fairly dazzling, keen lance rays of every color flashing, sparkling
    </p>
    <p>
     in glorious abundance, joining the plants in their fine, brave beauty-work—
    </p>
    <p>
     every crystal, every flower a window opening into heaven, a mirror reflecting
    </p>
    <p>
     the Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
     From garden to garden, ridge to ridge, I drifted enchanted, now on my knees
    </p>
    <p>
     gazing into the face of a daisy, now climbing again and again among the purple
    </p>
    <p>
     and azure flowers of the hemlocks, now down into the treasuries of the snow,
    </p>
    <p>
     or gazing afar over domes and peaks, lakes and woods, and the billowy
    </p>
    <p>
     glaciated fields of the upper Tuolumne, and trying to sketch them. In the midst
    </p>
    <p>
     of such beauty, pierced with its rays, one's body is all one tingling palate. Who
    </p>
    <p>
     wouldn't be a mountaineer! Up here all the world's prizes seem nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The largest of the many glacier lakes in sight, and the one with the finest shore
    </p>
    <p>
     scenery, is Tenaya, about a mile long, with an im posing mountain dipping its
    </p>
    <p>
     feet into it on the south side, Cathedral Peak a few miles above its head, many
    </p>
    <p>
     smooth swelling rock-waves and domes on the north, and in the distance
    </p>
    <p>
     southward a multitude of snowy peaks, the fountain-heads of rivers. Lake
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoffman lies shimmering beneath my feet, mountain pines around its shining
    </p>
    <p>
     rim. To the northward the picturesque basin of Yosemite Creek glitters with
    </p>
    <p>
     lakelets and pools; but the eye is soon drawn away from these bright mirror
    </p>
    <p>
     wells, however attractive, to revel in the glorious congregation of peaks on the
    </p>
    <p>
     axis of the range in their robes of snow and light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cathedral Peak
    </p>
    <p>
     Carlo caught an unfortunate woodchuck when it was running from a grassy
    </p>
    <p>
     spot to its boulder-pile home—one of the hardiest of the mountain animals. I
    </p>
    <p>
     tried hard to save him, but in vain. After telling Carlo that he must be careful
    </p>
    <p>
     not to kill anything, I caught sight, for the first time, of the curious pika, or
    </p>
    <p>
     little chief hare, that cuts large quantities of lupines and other plants and lays
    </p>
    <p>
     them out to dry in the sun for hay, which it stores in underground barns to
    </p>
    <p>
     last through the long, snowy winter. Coming upon these plants freshly cut and
    </p>
    <p>
     lying in handfuls here and there on the rocks has a startling effect of busy life
    </p>
    <p>
     on the lonely mountain-top. These little haymakers, endowed with brain stuff
    </p>
    <p>
     something like our own,—God up here looking after them,—what lessons they
    </p>
    <p>
     teach, how they widen our sympathy!
    </p>
    <p>
     An eagle soaring above a sheer cliff, where I suppose its nest is, makes another
    </p>
    <p>
     striking show of life, and helps to bring to mind the other people of the socalled solitude—deer in the forest caring for their young; the strong, well-clad,
    </p>
    <p>
     well-fed bears; the lively throng of squirrels; the blessed birds, great and small,
    </p>
    <p>
     stirring and sweetening the groves; and the clouds of happy insects filling the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky with joyous hum as part and parcel of the down-pouring sunshine. All
    </p>
    <p>
     these come to mind, as well as the plant people, and the glad streams singing
    </p>
    <p>
     their way to the sea. But most impressive of all is the vast glowing countenance
    </p>
    <p>
     of the wilderness in awful, infinite repose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Toward sunset, enjoyed a fine run to camp, down the long south slopes, across
    </p>
    <p>
     ridges and ravines, gardens and avalanche gaps, through the firs and
    </p>
    <p>
     chaparral, enjoying wild excitement and excess of strength, and so ends a day
    </p>
    <p>
     that will never end.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Up and away to Lake Tenaya,—another big day, enough for a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rocks, the air, everything speaking with audible voice or silent; joyful,
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderful, enchant ing, banishing weariness and sense of time. No longing for
    </p>
    <p>
     anything now or hereafter as we go home into the mountain's heart. The level
    </p>
    <p>
     sunbeams are touching the fir-tops, every leaf shining with dew. Am holding an
    </p>
    <p>
     easterly course, the deep cañon of Tenaya Creek on the right hand, Mount
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoffman on the left, and the lake straight ahead about ten miles distant, the
    </p>
    <p>
     summit of Mount Hoffman about three thousand feet above me, Tenaya Creek
    </p>
    <p>
     four thousand feet below and separated from the shallow, irregular valley,
    </p>
    <p>
     along which most of the way lies, by smooth domes and wave-ridges. Many
    </p>
    <p>
     mossy emerald bogs, meadows, and gardens in rocky hollows to wade and
    </p>
    <p>
     saunter through—and what fine plants they give me, what joyful streams I
    </p>
    <p>
     have to cross, and how many views are displayed of the Hoffman and Cathedral
    </p>
    <p>
     Peak masonry, and what a wondrous breadth of shining granite pavement to
    </p>
    <p>
     walk over for the first time about the shores of the lake! On I sauntered in
    </p>
    <p>
     freedom complete; body without weight as far as I was aware; now wading
    </p>
    <p>
     through starry parnassia bogs, now through gardens shoulder deep in larkspur
    </p>
    <p>
     and lilies, grasses and rushes, shaking off showers of dew; crossing piles of
    </p>
    <p>
     crystalline moraine boulders, bright mirror pavements, and cool, cheery
    </p>
    <p>
     streams going to Yosemite; crossing bryanthus carpets and the scoured
    </p>
    <p>
     pathways of avalanches, and thickets of snow-pressed ceanothus; then down a
    </p>
    <p>
     broad, majestic stairway into the ice-sculptured lake-basin.
    </p>
    <p>
     The snow on the high mountains is melting fast, and the streams are singing
    </p>
    <p>
     bank-full, swaying softly through the level meadows and bogs, quivering with
    </p>
    <p>
     sun-spangles, swirling in pot-holes, resting in deep pools, leaping, shouting in
    </p>
    <p>
     wild, exulting energy over rough boulder dams, joyful, beautiful in all their
    </p>
    <p>
     forms. No Sierra landscape that I have seen holds anything truly dead or dull,
    </p>
    <p>
     or any trace of what in manufactories is called rubbish or waste; everything is
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly clean and pure and full of divine lessons. This quick, inevitable
    </p>
    <p>
     interest attaching to everything seems marvelous until the hand of God
    </p>
    <p>
     becomes visible; then it seems reasonable that what interests Him may well
    </p>
    <p>
     interest us. When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to
    </p>
    <p>
     everything else in the universe. One fancies a heart like our own must be
    </p>
    <p>
     beating in every crystal and cell, and we feel like stopping to speak to the
    </p>
    <p>
     plants and animals as friendly fellow mountaineers. Nature as a poet, an
    </p>
    <p>
     enthusiastic workingman, becomes more and more visible the farther and
    </p>
    <p>
     higher we go; for the mountains are fountains—beginning places, however
    </p>
    <p>
     related to sources beyond mortal ken.
    </p>
    <p>
     I found three kinds of meadows: Those contained in basins not yet filled with
    </p>
    <p>
     earth enough to make a dry surface. They are planted with several species of
    </p>
    <p>
     carex, and have their margins diversified with robust flowering plants such as
    </p>
    <p>
     veratrum, larkspur, lupine, etc. Those contained in the same sort of basins,
    </p>
    <p>
     once lakes like the first, but so situated in relation to the streams that flow
    </p>
    <p>
     through them and beds of transportable sand, gravel, etc., that they are now
    </p>
    <p>
     high and dry and well drained. This dry condition and corresponding difference
    </p>
    <p>
     in their vegetation may be caused by no superiority of position, or power of
    </p>
    <p>
     transporting filling material in the streams that belong to them, but simply by
    </p>
    <p>
     the basin being shallow and therefore sooner filled. They are planted with
    </p>
    <p>
     grasses, mostly fine, silky, and rather short-leaved, Calamagrostis and Agrostis
    </p>
    <p>
     being the principal genera. They form delightfully smooth, level sods in which
    </p>
    <p>
     one finds two or three species of gentian and as many of purple and yellow
    </p>
    <p>
     orthocarpus, violet, vaccinium, kalmia, bryanthus, and lonicera. Meadows
    </p>
    <p>
     hanging on ridge and mountain slopes, not in basins at all, but made and held
    </p>
    <p>
     in place by masses of boulders and fallen trees, which, forming dams one above
    </p>
    <p>
     another in close succession on small, outspread, channelless streams, have
    </p>
    <p>
     collected soil enough for the growth of grasses, carices, and many flowering
    </p>
    <p>
     plants, and being kept well watered, without being subject to currents
    </p>
    <p>
     sufficiently strong to carry them away, a hanging or sloping meadow is the
    </p>
    <p>
     result. Their surfaces are seldom so smooth as the others, being roughened
    </p>
    <p>
     more or less by the projecting tops of the dam rocks or logs; but at a little
    </p>
    <p>
     distance this roughness is not noticed, and the effect is very striking—bright
    </p>
    <p>
     green, fluent, down-sweeping flowery ribbons on gray slopes. The broad
    </p>
    <p>
     shallow streams these meadows belong to are mostly derived from banks of
    </p>
    <p>
     snow and because the soil is well drained in some places, while in others the
    </p>
    <p>
     dam rocks are packed close and caulked with bits of wood and leaves, making
    </p>
    <p>
     boggy patches; the vegetation, of course, is correspondingly varied. I saw
    </p>
    <p>
     patches of willow, bryanthus, and a fine show of lilies on some of them, not
    </p>
    <p>
     forming a margin, but scattered about among the carex and grass. Most of
    </p>
    <p>
     these meadows are now in their prime. How wonderful must be the temper of
    </p>
    <p>
     the elastic leaves of grasses and sedges to make curves so perfect and fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tempered a little harder, they would stand erect, stiff and bristly, like strips of
    </p>
    <p>
     metal; a little softer, and every leaf would lie flat. And what fine painting and
    </p>
    <p>
     tinting there is on the glumes and pales, stamens and feathery pistils.
    </p>
    <p>
     Butterflies colored like the flowers waver above them in wonderful profusion,
    </p>
    <p>
     and many other beautiful winged people, numbered and known and loved only
    </p>
    <p>
     by the Lord, are waltzing together high over head, seemingly in pure play and
    </p>
    <p>
     hilarious enjoyment of their little sparks of life. How wonderful they are! How
    </p>
    <p>
     do they get a living, and endure the weather? How are their little bodies, with
    </p>
    <p>
     muscles, nerves, organs, kept warm and jolly in such admirable exuberant
    </p>
    <p>
     health? Regarded only as mechanical inventions, how wonderful they are!
    </p>
    <p>
     Compared with these, Godlike man's greatest machines are as nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of the sandy gardens on moraines are in prime beauty like the meadows,
    </p>
    <p>
     though some on the north sides of rocks and beneath groves of sapling pines
    </p>
    <p>
     have not yet bloomed. On sunny sheets of crystal soil along the slopes of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoffman Mountains, I saw extensive patches of ivesia and purple gilia with
    </p>
    <p>
     scarce a green leaf, making fine clouds of color. Ribes bushes, vaccinium, and
    </p>
    <p>
     kalmia, now in flower, make beautiful rugs and borders along the banks of the
    </p>
    <p>
     streams. Shaggy beds of dwarf oak Quercus chrysolepis, var. vaccinifolia over
    </p>
    <p>
     which one may walk are common on rocky moraines, yet this is the same
    </p>
    <p>
     species as the large live oak seen near Brown's Flat. The most beautiful of the
    </p>
    <p>
     shrubs is the purple-flowered bryanthus, here making glorious carpets at an
    </p>
    <p>
     elevation of nine thousand feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The principal tree for the first mile or two from camp is the magnificent silver
    </p>
    <p>
     fir, which reaches perfection here both in size and form of individual trees, and
    </p>
    <p>
     in the mode of grouping in groves with open spaces between. So trim and
    </p>
    <p>
     tasteful are these silvery, spiry groves one would fancy they must have been
    </p>
    <p>
     placed in position by some master landscape gardener, their regularity seeming
    </p>
    <p>
     almost conventional. But Nature is the only gardener able to do work so fine. A
    </p>
    <p>
     few noble specimens two hundred feet high occupy central positions in the
    </p>
    <p>
     groups with younger trees around them; and outside of these another circle of
    </p>
    <p>
     yet smaller ones, the whole arranged like tastefully symmetrical bouquets,
    </p>
    <p>
     every tree fitting nicely the place assigned to it as if made especially for it; small
    </p>
    <p>
     roses and eriogonums are usually found blooming on the open spaces about
    </p>
    <p>
     the groves, forming charming pleasure grounds. Higher, the firs gradually
    </p>
    <p>
     become smaller and less perfect, many showing double summits, indicating
    </p>
    <p>
     storm stress. Still, where good moraine soil is found, even on the rim of the
    </p>
    <p>
     lake-basin, specimens one hundred and fifty feet in height and five feet in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter occur nearly nine thousand feet above the sea. The saplings, I find,
    </p>
    <p>
     are mostly bent with the crushing weight of the winter snow, which at this
    </p>
    <p>
     elevation must be at least eight or ten feet deep, judging by marks on the trees;
    </p>
    <p>
     and this depth of compacted snow is heavy enough to bend and bury young
    </p>
    <p>
     trees twenty or thirty feet in height and hold them down for four or five
    </p>
    <p>
     months. Some are broken; the others spring up when the snow melts and at
    </p>
    <p>
     length attain a size that enables them to withstand the snow pressure. Yet even
    </p>
    <p>
     in trees five feet thick the traces of this early discipline are still plainly to be
    </p>
    <p>
     seen in their curved insteps, and frequently in old dried saplings protruding
    </p>
    <p>
     from the trunk, partially overgrown by the new axis developed from a branch
    </p>
    <p>
     below the break. Yet through all this stress the forest is maintained in
    </p>
    <p>
     marvelous beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beyond the silver firs I find the two-leaved pine Pinus contorta, var. Murrayana
    </p>
    <p>
     forms the bulk of the forest up to an elevation of ten thousand feet or more—
    </p>
    <p>
     the highest timber-belt of the Sierra. I saw a specimen nearly five feet in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter growing on deep, well-watered soil at an elevation of about nine
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand feet. The form of this species varies very much with position,
    </p>
    <p>
     exposure, soil, etc. On stream-banks, where it is closely planted, it is very
    </p>
    <p>
     slender; some specimens seventy-five feet high do not exceed five inches in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter at the ground, but the ordinary form, as far as I have seen, is well
    </p>
    <p>
     proportioned. The average diameter when full grown at this elevation is about
    </p>
    <p>
     twelve or fourteen inches, height forty or fifty feet, the straggling branches bent
    </p>
    <p>
     up at the end, the bark thin and bedraggled with amber-colored resin. The
    </p>
    <p>
     pistillate flowers form little crimson rosettes a fourth of an inch in diameter on
    </p>
    <p>
     the ends of the branchlets, mostly hidden in the leaf-tassels; the staminate are
    </p>
    <p>
     about three eighths of an inch in diameter, sulphur-yellow, in showy clusters,
    </p>
    <p>
     giving a remarkably rich effect—a brave, hardy mountaineer pine, growing
    </p>
    <p>
     cheerily on rough beds of avalanche boulders and joints of rock pavements, as
    </p>
    <p>
     well as in fertile hollows, standing up to the waist in snow every winter for
    </p>
    <p>
     centuries, facing a thousand storms and blooming every year in colors as
    </p>
    <p>
     bright as those worn by the sun-drenched trees of the tropics.
    </p>
    <p>
     A still hardier mountaineer is the Sierra juniper Juniperus occidentalis,
    </p>
    <p>
     growing mostly on domes and ridges and glacier pavements. A thickset,
    </p>
    <p>
     sturdy, picturesque highlander, seemingly content to live for more than a score
    </p>
    <p>
     of centuries on sunshine and snow; a truly wonderful fellow, dogged endurance
    </p>
    <p>
     expressed in every feature, lasting about as long as the granite he stands on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some are nearly as broad as high. I saw one on the shore of the lake nearly ten
    </p>
    <p>
     feet in diameter, and many six to eight feet. The bark, cinnamon-colored, flakes
    </p>
    <p>
     off in long ribbon-like strips with a satiny luster. Surely the most enduring of
    </p>
    <p>
     all tree mountaineers, it never seems to die a natural death, or even to fall after
    </p>
    <p>
     it has been killed. If protected from accidents, it would perhaps be immortal. I
    </p>
    <p>
     saw some that had withstood an avalanche from snowy Mount Hoffman
    </p>
    <p>
     cheerily putting out new branches, as if repeating, like Grip, "Never say die."
    </p>
    <p>
     Some were simply standing on the pavement where no fissure more than half
    </p>
    <p>
     an inch wide offered a hold for its roots. The common height for these rockdwellers is from ten to twenty feet; most of the old ones have broken tops, and
    </p>
    <p>
     are mere stumps, with a few tufted branches, forming picturesque brown
    </p>
    <p>
     pillars on bare pavements, with plenty of elbow-room and a clear view in every
    </p>
    <p>
     direction. On good moraine soil it reaches a height of from forty to sixty feet,
    </p>
    <p>
     with dense gray foliage. The rings of the trunk are very thin, eighty to an inch
    </p>
    <p>
     of diameter in some specimens I examined. Those ten feet in diameter must be
    </p>
    <p>
     very old—thousands of years. Wish I could live, like these junipers, on
    </p>
    <p>
     sunshine and snow, and stand beside them on the shore of Lake Tenaya for a
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand years. How much I should see, and how delightful it would be!
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything in the mountains would find me and come to me, and everything
    </p>
    <p>
     from the heavens like light.
    </p>
    <p>
     JUNIPERS IN TENAYA CANON
    </p>
    <p>
     The lake was named for one of the chiefs of the Yosemite tribe. Old Tenaya is
    </p>
    <p>
     said to have been a good Indian to his tribe. When a company of soldiers
    </p>
    <p>
     followed his band into Yosemite to punish them for cattle-stealing and other
    </p>
    <p>
     crimes, they fled to this lake by a trail that leads out of the upper end of the
    </p>
    <p>
     valley, early in the spring, while the snow was still deep; but being pursued,
    </p>
    <p>
     they lost heart and surrendered. A fine monument the old man has in this
    </p>
    <p>
     bright lake, and likely to last a long time, though lakes die as well as Indians,
    </p>
    <p>
     being gradually filled with detritus carried in by the feeding streams, and to
    </p>
    <p>
     some extent also by snow avalanches and rain and wind. A considerable
    </p>
    <p>
     portion of the Tenaya basin is already changed into a forested flat and meadow
    </p>
    <p>
     at the upper end, where the main tributary enters from Cathedral Peak. Two
    </p>
    <p>
     other tributaries come from the Hoffman Range. The outlet flows westward
    </p>
    <p>
     through Tenaya Cañon to join the Merced River in Yosemite. Scarce a handful
    </p>
    <p>
     of loose soil is to be seen on the north shore. All is bare, shining granite,
    </p>
    <p>
     suggesting the Indian name of the lake, Pywiack, meaning shining rock. The
    </p>
    <p>
     basin seems to have been slowly excavated by the ancient glaciers, a marvelous
    </p>
    <p>
     work requiring countless thousands of years. On the south side an imposing
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain rises from the water's edge to a height of three thousand feet or
    </p>
    <p>
     more, feathered with hemlock and pine; and huge shining domes on the east,
    </p>
    <p>
     over the tops of which the grinding, wasting, molding glacier must have swept
    </p>
    <p>
     as the wind does to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . No cloud mountains, only curly cirrus wisps scarce perceptible, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     want of thunder to strike the noon hour seems strange, as if the Sierra clock
    </p>
    <p>
     had stopped. Have been studying the magnifica fir—measured one near two
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred and forty feet high, the tallest I have yet seen. This species is the most
    </p>
    <p>
     symmetrical of all conifers, but though gigantic in size it seldom lives more
    </p>
    <p>
     than four or five hundred years. Most of the trees die from the attacks of a
    </p>
    <p>
     fungus at the age of two or three centuries. This dry-rot fungus perhaps enters
    </p>
    <p>
     the trunk by way of the stumps of limbs broken off by the snow that loads the
    </p>
    <p>
     broad palmate branches. The younger specimens are marvels of symmetry,
    </p>
    <p>
     straight and erect as a plumb-line, their branches in regular level whorls of five
    </p>
    <p>
     mostly, each branch as exact in its divisions as a fern frond, and thickly
    </p>
    <p>
     covered by the leaves, making a rich plush over all the tree, excepting only the
    </p>
    <p>
     trunk and a small portion of the main limbs. The leaves turn upward,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially on the branchlets, and are stiff and sharp, pointed on all the upper
    </p>
    <p>
     portion of the tree. They remain on the tree about eight or ten years, and as the
    </p>
    <p>
     growth is rapid it is not rare to find the leaves still in place on the upper part of
    </p>
    <p>
     the axis where it is three to four inches in diameter, wide apart of course, and
    </p>
    <p>
     their spiral arrangement beautifully displayed. The leaf-scars are conspicuous
    </p>
    <p>
     for twenty years or more, but there is a good deal of variation in different trees
    </p>
    <p>
     as to the thickness and sharpness of the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the excursion to Mount Hoffman I had seen a complete cross-section of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Sierra forest, and I find that Abies magnifica is the most symmetrical tree
    </p>
    <p>
     of all the noble coniferous company. The cones are grand affairs, superb in
    </p>
    <p>
     form, size, and color, cylindrical, stand erect on the upper branches like casks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and are from five to eight inches in length by three or four in diameter,
    </p>
    <p>
     greenish gray, and covered with fine down which has a silvery luster in the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunshine, and their brilliance is augmented by beads of transparent balsam
    </p>
    <p>
     which seems to have been poured over each cone, bringing to mind the old
    </p>
    <p>
     ceremonies of anointing with oil. If possible, the inside of the cone is more
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful than the outside; the scales, bracts, and seed wings are tinted with
    </p>
    <p>
     the loveliest rosy purple with a bright lustrous iridescence; the seeds, three
    </p>
    <p>
     fourths of an inch long, are dark brown. When the cones are ripe the scales
    </p>
    <p>
     and bracts fall off, setting the seeds free to fly to their predestined places, while
    </p>
    <p>
     the dead spike-like axes are left on the branches for many years to mark the
    </p>
    <p>
     positions of the vanished cones, excepting those cut off when green by the
    </p>
    <p>
     Douglas squirrel. How he gets his teeth under the broad bases of the sessile
    </p>
    <p>
     cones, I don't know. Climbing these trees on a sunny day to visit the growing
    </p>
    <p>
     cones and to gaze over the tops of the forest is one of my best enjoyments.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Bright, cool, exhilarating. Clouds about .. Another glorious day of
    </p>
    <p>
     rambling, sketching, and universal enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Clouds ., but the regular shower did not reach us, though thunder was
    </p>
    <p>
     heard a few miles off striking the noon hour. Ants, flies, and mosquitoes seem
    </p>
    <p>
     to enjoy this fine climate. A few house-flies have discovered our camp. The
    </p>
    <p>
     Sierra mosquitoes are courageous and of good size, some of them measuring
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly an inch from tip of sting to tip of folded wings. Though less abundant
    </p>
    <p>
     than in most wildernesses, they occasionally make quite a hum and stir, and
    </p>
    <p>
     pay but little attention to time or place. They sting anywhere, any time of day,
    </p>
    <p>
     wherever they can find anything worth while, until they are themselves stung
    </p>
    <p>
     by frost. The large, jet-black ants are only ticklish and troublesome when one
    </p>
    <p>
     is lying down under the trees. Noticed a borer drilling a silver fir. Ovipositor
    </p>
    <p>
     about an inch and a half in length, polished and straight like a needle. When
    </p>
    <p>
     not in use, it is folded back in a sheath, which extends straight behind like the
    </p>
    <p>
     legs of a crane in flying. This drilling, I suppose, is to save nest building, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the after care of feeding the young. Who would guess that in the brain of a fly
    </p>
    <p>
     so much knowledge could find lodgment? How do they know that their eggs will
    </p>
    <p>
     hatch in such holes, or, after they hatch, that the soft, helpless grubs will find
    </p>
    <p>
     the right sort of nourishment in silver fir sap? This domestic arrangement calls
    </p>
    <p>
     to mind the curious family of gallflies. Each species seems to know what kind
    </p>
    <p>
     of plant will respond to the irritation or stimulus of the puncture it makes and
    </p>
    <p>
     the eggs it lays, in forming a growth that not only answers for a nest and home
    </p>
    <p>
     but also provides food for the young. Probably these gallflies make mistakes at
    </p>
    <p>
     times, like anybody else; but when they do, there is simply a failure of that
    </p>
    <p>
     particular brood, while enough to perpetuate the species do find the proper
    </p>
    <p>
     plants and nourishment. Many mistakes of this kind might be made without
    </p>
    <p>
     being discovered by us. Once a pair of wrens made the mistake of building a
    </p>
    <p>
     nest in the sleeve of a workman's coat, which was called for at sundown, much
    </p>
    <p>
     to the consternation and discomfiture of the birds. Still the marvel remains
    </p>
    <p>
     that any of the children of such small people as gnats and mosquitoes should
    </p>
    <p>
     escape their own and their parents' mistakes, as well as the vicissitudes of the
    </p>
    <p>
     weather and hosts of enemies, and come forth in full vigor and perfection to
    </p>
    <p>
     enjoy the sunny world. When we think of the small creatures that are visible,
    </p>
    <p>
     we are led to think of many that are smaller still and lead us on and on into
    </p>
    <p>
     infinite mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
     July . Another glorious day, the air as delicious to the lungs as nectar to the
    </p>
    <p>
     tongue; indeed the body seems one palate, and tingles equally throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cloudiness about ., but our ordinary shower has not yet reached us, though I
    </p>
    <p>
     hear thunder in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cheery little chipmunk, so common about Brown's Flat, is common here
    </p>
    <p>
     also, and perhaps other species. In their light, airy habits they recall the
    </p>
    <p>
     familiar species of the Eastern States, which we admired in the oak openings of
    </p>
    <p>
     Wisconsin as they skimmed along the zigzag rail fences. These Sierra
    </p>
    <p>
     chipmunks are more arboreal and squirrel-like. I first noticed them on the
    </p>
    <p>
     lower edge of the coniferous belt, where the Sabine and yellow pines meet,—
    </p>
    <p>
     exceedingly interesting little fellows, full of odd, funny ways, and without being
    </p>
    <p>
     true squirrels, have most of their accomplishments without their aggressive
    </p>
    <p>
     quarrelsomeness. I never weary watching them as they frisk about in the
    </p>
    <p>
     bushes gathering seeds and berries, like song sparrows poising daintily on
    </p>
    <p>
     slender twigs, and making even less stir than most birds of the same size. Few
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Sierra animals interest me more; they are so able, gentle, confiding, and
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful, they take one's heart, and get themselves adopted as darlings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though weighing hardly more than field mice, they are laborious collectors of
    </p>
    <p>
     seeds, nuts, and cones, and are therefore well fed, but never in the least
    </p>
    <p>
     swollen with fat or lazily full. On the contrary, of their frisky, birdlike liveliness
    </p>
    <p>
     there is no end. They have a great variety of notes corresponding with their
    </p>
    <p>
     movements, some sweet and liquid, like water dripping with tinkling sounds
    </p>
    <p>
     into pools. They seem dearly to love teasing a dog, coming frequently almost
    </p>
    <p>
     within reach, then frisking away with lively chipping, like sparrows, beating
    </p>
    <p>
     time to their music with their tails, which at each chip describe half circles
    </p>
    <p>
     from side to side. Not even the Douglas squirrel is surer-footed or more
    </p>
    <p>
     fearless. I have seen them running about on sheer precipices of the Yosemite
    </p>
    <p>
     walls seemingly holding on with as little effort as flies, and as unconscious of
    </p>
    <p>
     danger, where, if the slightest slip were made, they would have fallen two or
    </p>
    <p>
     three thousand feet. How fine it would be could we mountaineers climb these
    </p>
    <p>
     tremendous cliffs with the same sure grip! The venture I made the other day for
    </p>
    <p>
     a view of the Yosemite Fall, and which tried my nerves so sorely, this little
    </p>
    <p>
     Tamias would have made for an ear of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woodchuck Arctomys monax of the bleak mountain-tops is a very different
    </p>
    <p>
     sort of mountaineer—the most bovine of rodents, a heavy eater, fat, aldermanic
    </p>
    <p>
     in bulk and fairly bloated, in his high pastures, like a cow in a clover field. One
    </p>
    <p>
     woodchuck would outweigh a hundred chipmunks, and yet he is by no means
    </p>
    <p>
     a dull animal. In the midst of what we regard as storm-beaten desolation he
    </p>
    <p>
     pipes and whistles right cheerily, and enjoys long life in his skyland homes. His
    </p>
    <p>
     burrow is made in disintegrated rocks or beneath large boulders. Coming out of
    </p>
    <p>
     his den in the cold hoarfrost mornings, he takes a sun-bath on some favorite
    </p>
    <p>
     flat-topped rock, then goes to breakfast in garden hollows, eats grass and
    </p>
    <p>
     flowers until comfortably swollen, then goes a-visiting to fight and play. How
    </p>
    <p>
     long a woodchuck lives in this bracing air I don't know, but some of them are
    </p>
    <p>
     rusty and gray like lichen-covered boulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . A grand cloudland and five-minute shower, refreshing the blessed
    </p>
    <p>
     wilderness, already so fragrant and fresh, steeping the black meadow mold and
    </p>
    <p>
     dead leaves like tea.
    </p>
    <p>
     The waycup, or flicker, so familiar to every boy in the old Middle West States, is
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the most common of the wood-peckers hereabouts, and makes one feel
    </p>
    <p>
     at home. I can see no difference in plumage or habits from the Eastern species,
    </p>
    <p>
     though the climate here is so different,—a fine, brave, confiding, beautiful bird.
    </p>
    <p>
     The robin, too, is here, with all his familiar notes and gestures, tripping daintily
    </p>
    <p>
     on open garden spots and high meadows. Over all America he seems to be at
    </p>
    <p>
     home, moving from the plains to the mountains and from north to south, back
    </p>
    <p>
     and forth, up and down, with the march of the seasons and food supply. How
    </p>
    <p>
     admirable the constitution and temper of this brave singer, keeping in cheery
    </p>
    <p>
     health over so vast and varied a range! Oftentimes, as I wander through these
    </p>
    <p>
     solemn woods, awe-stricken and silent, I hear the reassuring voice of this
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow wanderer ringing out, sweet and clear, "Fear not! fear not!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The mountain quail Oreortyx ricta I often meet in my walks—a small brown
    </p>
    <p>
     partridge with a very long, slender, ornamental crest worn jauntily like a
    </p>
    <p>
     feather in a boy's cap, giving it a very marked appearance. This species is
    </p>
    <p>
     considerably larger than the valley quail, so common on the hot foothills. They
    </p>
    <p>
     seldom alight in trees, but love to wander in flocks of from five or six to twenty
    </p>
    <p>
     through the ceanothus and manzanita thickets and over open, dry meadows
    </p>
    <p>
     and rocks of the ridges where the forest is less dense or wanting, uttering a low
    </p>
    <p>
     clucking sound to enable them to keep together. When disturbed they rise with
    </p>
    <p>
     a strong birr of wing-beats, and scatter as if exploded to a distance of a quarter
    </p>
    <p>
     of a mile or so. After the danger is past they call one another together with a
    </p>
    <p>
     loud piping note—Nature's beautiful mountain chickens. I have not yet found
    </p>
    <p>
     their nests. The young of this season are already hatched and away—new
    </p>
    <p>
     broods of happy wanderers half as large as their parents. I wonder how they
    </p>
    <p>
     live through the long winters, when the ground is snow-covered ten feet deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     They must go down towards the lower edge of the forest, like the deer, though I
    </p>
    <p>
     have not heard of them there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The blue, or dusky, grouse is also common here. They like the deepest and
    </p>
    <p>
     closest fir woods, and when disturbed, burst from the branches of the trees
    </p>
    <p>
     with a strong, loud whir of wing-beats, and vanish in a wavering, silent slide,
    </p>
    <p>
     without moving a feather—a stout, beautiful bird about the size of the prairie
    </p>
    <p>
     chicken of the old west, spending most of the time in the trees, excepting the
    </p>
    <p>
     breeding season, when it keeps to the ground. The young are now able to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
     When scattered by man or dog, they keep still until the danger is supposed to
    </p>
    <p>
     be passed, then the mother calls them together. The chicks can hear the call a
    </p>
    <p>
     distance of several hundred yards, though it is not loud. Should the young be
    </p>
    <p>
     unable to fly, the mother feigns desperate lameness or death to draw one away,
    </p>
    <p>
     throwing herself at one's feet within two or three yards, rolling over on her
    </p>
    <p>
     back, kicking and gasping, so as to de ceive man or beast. They are said to stay
    </p>
    <p>
     all the year in the woods hereabouts, taking shelter in dense tufted branches of
    </p>
    <p>
     fir and yellow pine during snowstorms, and feeding on the young buds of these
    </p>
    <p>
     trees. Their legs are feathered down to their toes, and I have never heard of
    </p>
    <p>
     their suffering in any sort of weather. Able to live on pine and fir buds, they are
    </p>
    <p>
     forever independent in the matter of food, which troubles so many of us and
    </p>
    <p>
     controls our movements. Gladly, if I could, I would live forever on pine buds,
    </p>
    <p>
     however full of turpentine and pitch, for the sake of this grand independence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just to think of our sufferings last month merely for grist-mill flour. Man
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to have more difficulty in gaining food than any other of the Lord's
    </p>
    <p>
     creatures. For many in towns it is a consuming, lifelong struggle; for others,
    </p>
    <p>
     the danger of coming to want is so great, the deadly habit of endless hoarding
    </p>
    <p>
     for the future is formed, which smothers all real life, and is continued long
    </p>
    <p>
     after every reasonable need has been over-supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
     On Mount Hoffman I saw a curious dove-colored bird that seemed half
    </p>
    <p>
     woodpecker, half magpie, or crow. It screams something like a crow, but flies
    </p>
    <p>
     like a woodpecker, and has a long, straight bill, with which I saw it opening the
    </p>
    <p>
     cones of the mountain and white- barked pines. It seems to keep to the
    </p>
    <p>
     heights, though no doubt it comes down for shelter during winter, if not for
    </p>
    <p>
     food. So far as food is concerned, these bird-mountaineers, I guess, can glean
    </p>
    <p>
     nuts enough, even in winter, from the different kinds of conifers; for always
    </p>
    <p>
     there are a few that have been unable to fly out of the cones and remain for
    </p>
    <p>
     hungry winter gleaners.

    <p>
     A STRANGE EXPERIENCE
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Clouds and showers, about the same as yesterday. Sketching all day
    </p>
    <p>
     on the North Dome until four or five o'clock in the afternoon, when, as I was
    </p>
    <p>
     busily employed thinking only of the glorious Yosemite landscape, trying to
    </p>
    <p>
     draw every tree and every line and feature of the rocks, I was suddenly, and
    </p>
    <p>
     without warning, possessed with the notion that my friend, Professor J. D.
    </p>
    <p>
     Butler, of the State University of Wisconsin, was below me in the valley, and I
    </p>
    <p>
     jumped up full of the idea of meeting him, with almost as much startling
    </p>
    <p>
     excitement as if he had suddenly touched me to make me look up. Leaving my
    </p>
    <p>
     work without the slightest deliberation, I ran down the western slope of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Dome and along the brink of the valley wall, looking for a way to the bottom,
    </p>
    <p>
     until I came to a side cañon, which, judging by its apparently continuous
    </p>
    <p>
     growth of trees and bushes, I thought might afford a practical way into the
    </p>
    <p>
     valley, and immediately began to make the descent, late as it was, as if drawn
    </p>
    <p>
     irresistibly. But after a little, com mon sense stopped me and explained that it
    </p>
    <p>
     would be long after dark ere I could possibly reach the hotel, that the visitors
    </p>
    <p>
     would be asleep, that nobody would know me, that I had no money in my
    </p>
    <p>
     pockets, and moreover was without a coat. I therefore compelled myself to stop,
    </p>
    <p>
     and finally succeeded in reasoning myself out of the notion of seeking my
    </p>
    <p>
     friend in the dark, whose presence I only felt in a strange, telepathic way. I
    </p>
    <p>
     succeeded in dragging myself back through the woods to camp, never for a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment wavering, however, in my determination to go down to him next
    </p>
    <p>
     morning. This I think is the most unexplainable notion that ever struck me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had some one whispered in my ear while I sat on the Dome, where I had spent
    </p>
    <p>
     so many days, that Professor Butler was in the valley, I could not have been
    </p>
    <p>
     more surprised and startled. When I was leaving the university, he said, "Now,
    </p>
    <p>
     John, I want to hold you in sight and watch your career. Promise to write me at
    </p>
    <p>
     least once a year." I received a letter from him in July, at our first camp in the
    </p>
    <p>
     Hollow, written in May, in which he said that he might possibly visit California
    </p>
    <p>
     some time this summer, and therefore hoped to meet me. But inasmuch as he
    </p>
    <p>
     named no meeting-place, and gave no directions as to the course he would
    </p>
    <p>
     probably follow, and as I should be in the wilderness all summer, I had not the
    </p>
    <p>
     slightest hope of seeing him, and all thought of the matter had vanished from
    </p>
    <p>
     my mind until this afternoon, when he seemed to be wafted bodily almost
    </p>
    <p>
     against my face. Well, to-morrow I shall see; for, reasonable or unreasonable, I
    </p>
    <p>
     feel I must go.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Had a wonderful day. Found Professor Butler as the compass-needle
    </p>
    <p>
     finds the pole. So last evening's telepathy, transcendental revelation, or
    </p>
    <p>
     whatever else it may be called, was true; for, strange to say, he had just
    </p>
    <p>
     entered the valley by way of the Coulterville Trail and was coming up the valley
    </p>
    <p>
     past El Capitan when his presence struck me. Had he then looked toward the
    </p>
    <p>
     North Dome with a good glass when it first came in sight, he might have seen
    </p>
    <p>
     me jump up from my work and run toward him. This seems the one welldefined marvel of my life of the kind called supernatural; for, absorbed in glad
    </p>
    <p>
     Nature, spirit-rappings, second sight, ghost stories, etc., have never interested
    </p>
    <p>
     me since boyhood, seeming comparatively useless and infinitely less wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     than Nature's open, harmonious, songful, sunny, everyday beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     This morning, when I thought of having to appear among tourists at a hotel, I
    </p>
    <p>
     was troubled because I had no suitable clothes, and at best am desperately
    </p>
    <p>
     bashful and shy. I was determined to go, however, to see my old friend after
    </p>
    <p>
     two years among strangers; got on a clean pair of overalls, a cashmere shirt,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a sort of jacket,—the best my camp wardrobe afforded,—tied my notebook
    </p>
    <p>
     on my belt, and strode away on my strange journey, followed by Carlo. I made
    </p>
    <p>
     my way though the gap discovered last evening, which proved to be Indian
    </p>
    <p>
     Cañon. There was no trail in it, and the rocks and brush were so rough that
    </p>
    <p>
     Carlo frequently called me back to help him down precipitous places. Emerging
    </p>
    <p>
     from the cañon shadows, I found a man making hay on one of the meadows,
    </p>
    <p>
     and asked him whether Professor Butler was in the valley. "I don't know," he
    </p>
    <p>
     replied; "but you can easily find out at the hotel. There are but few visitors in
    </p>
    <p>
     the valley just now. A small party came in yesterday afternoon, and I heard
    </p>
    <p>
     some one called Professor Butler, or Butterfield, or some name like that."
    </p>
    <p>
     The Vernal Falls, Yosemite National Park
    </p>
    <p>
     In front of the gloomy hotel I found a tourist party adjusting their fishing
    </p>
    <p>
     tackle. They all stared at me in silent wonderment, as if I had been seen
    </p>
    <p>
     dropping down through the trees from the clouds, mostly, I suppose, on
    </p>
    <p>
     account of my strange garb. Inquiring for the office, I was told it was locked,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that the landlord was away, but I might find the landlady, Mrs. Hutchings,
    </p>
    <p>
     in the parlor. I entered in a sad state of embarrassment, and after I had waited
    </p>
    <p>
     in the big, empty room and knocked at several doors the landlady at length
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared, and in reply to my question said she rather thought Professor Butler
    </p>
    <p>
     was in the valley, but to make sure, she would bring the register from the
    </p>
    <p>
     office. Among the names of the last arrivals I soon discovered the Professor's
    </p>
    <p>
     familiar handwriting, at the sight of which bashfulness vanished; and having
    </p>
    <p>
     learned that his party had gone up the valley,—probably to the Vernal and
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevada Falls,—I pushed on in glad pursuit, my heart now sure of its prey. In
    </p>
    <p>
     less than an hour I reached the head of the Nevada Cañon at the Vernal Fall,
    </p>
    <p>
     and just outside of the spray discovered a distinguished-looking gentleman,
    </p>
    <p>
     who, like everybody else I have seen to-day, regarded me curiously as I
    </p>
    <p>
     approached. When I made bold to inquire if he knew where Professor Butler
    </p>
    <p>
     was, he seemed yet more curious to know what could possibly have happened
    </p>
    <p>
     that required a messenger for the Professor, and instead of answering my
    </p>
    <p>
     question he asked with military sharpness, "Who wants him?" "I want him," I
    </p>
    <p>
     replied with equal sharp ness. "Why? Do you know him?" "Yes," I said. "Do you
    </p>
    <p>
     know him?" Astonished that any one in the mountains could possibly know
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Butler and find him as soon as he had reached the valley, he came
    </p>
    <p>
     down to meet the strange mountaineer on equal terms, and courteously
    </p>
    <p>
     replied, "Yes, I know Professor Butler very well. I am General Alvord, and we
    </p>
    <p>
     were fellow students in Rutland, Vermont, long ago, when we were both
    </p>
    <p>
     young." "But where is he now?" I persisted, cutting short his story. "He has
    </p>
    <p>
     gone beyond the falls with a companion, to try to climb that big rock, the top of
    </p>
    <p>
     which you see from here." His guide now volunteered the information that it
    </p>
    <p>
     was the Liberty Cap Professor Butler and his companion had gone to climb,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that if I waited at the head of the fall I should be sure to find them on their
    </p>
    <p>
     way down. I therefore climbed the ladders alongside the Vernal Fall, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     pushing forward, determined to go to the top of Liberty Cap rock in my hurry,
    </p>
    <p>
     rather than wait, if I should not meet my friend sooner. So heart-hungry at
    </p>
    <p>
     times may one be to see a friend in the flesh, however happily full and care-free
    </p>
    <p>
     one's life may be. I had gone but a short distance, however, above the brow of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Vernal Fall when I caught sight of him in the brush and rocks, half erect,
    </p>
    <p>
     groping his way, his sleeves rolled up, vest open, hat in his hand, evidently
    </p>
    <p>
     very hot and tired. When he saw me coming he sat down on a boulder to wipe
    </p>
    <p>
     the perspiration from his brow and neck, and taking me for one of the valley
    </p>
    <p>
     guides, he inquired the way to the fall ladders. I pointed out the path marked
    </p>
    <p>
     with little piles of stones, on seeing which he called his companion, saying that
    </p>
    <p>
     the way was found; but he did not yet recognize me. Then I stood directly in
    </p>
    <p>
     front of him, looked him in the face, and held out my hand. He thought I was
    </p>
    <p>
     offering to assist him in rising. "Never mind," he said. Then I said, "Professor
    </p>
    <p>
     Butler, don't you know me?" "I think not," he replied; but catching my eye,
    </p>
    <p>
     sudden recognition followed, and astonishment that I should have found him
    </p>
    <p>
     just when he was lost in the brush and did not know that I was within
    </p>
    <p>
     hundreds of miles of him. "John Muir, John Muir, where have you come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I told him the story of my feeling his presence when he entered the valley
    </p>
    <p>
     last evening, when he was four or five miles distant, as I sat sketching on the
    </p>
    <p>
     North Dome. This, of course, only made him wonder the more. Below the foot of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Vernal Fall the guide was waiting with his saddle-horse, and I walked along
    </p>
    <p>
     the trail, chatting all the way back to the hotel, talking of school days, friends
    </p>
    <p>
     in Madison, of the students, how each had prospered, etc., ever and anon
    </p>
    <p>
     gazing at the stupendous rocks about us, now growing indistinct in the
    </p>
    <p>
     gloaming, and again quoting from the poets—a rare ramble.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was late ere we reached the hotel, and General Alvord was waiting the
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor's arrival for dinner. When I was introduced he seemed yet more
    </p>
    <p>
     astonished than the Professor at my descent from cloudland and going straight
    </p>
    <p>
     to my friend without knowing in any ordinary way that he was even in
    </p>
    <p>
     California. They had come on direct from the East, had not yet visited any of
    </p>
    <p>
     their friends in the state, and considered themselves undiscoverable. As we sat
    </p>
    <p>
     at dinner, the General leaned back in his chair, and looking down the table,
    </p>
    <p>
     thus introduced me to the dozen guests or so, including the staring fisherman
    </p>
    <p>
     mentioned above: "This man, you know, came down out of these huge,
    </p>
    <p>
     trackless mountains, you know, to find his friend Professor Butler here, the
    </p>
    <p>
     very day he arrived; and how did he know he was here? He just felt him, he
    </p>
    <p>
     says. This is the queerest case of Scotch farsightedness I ever heard of," etc.,
    </p>
    <p>
     etc. While my friend quoted Shakespeare: "More things in heaven and earth,
    </p>
    <p>
     Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philos ophy," "As the sun, ere he has risen,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes paints his image in the firmament, e'en so the shadows of events
    </p>
    <p>
     precede the events, and in to-day already walks to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     Had a long conversation, after dinner, over Madison days. The Professor wants
    </p>
    <p>
     me to promise to go with him, sometime, on a camping trip in the Hawaiian
    </p>
    <p>
     Islands, while I tried to get him to go back with me to camp in the high Sierra.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he says, "Not now." He must not leave the General; and I was surprised to
    </p>
    <p>
     learn they are to leave the valley to-morrow or next day. I'm glad I'm not great
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to be missed in the busy world.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . It seemed strange to sleep in a paltry hotel chamber after the spacious
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificence and luxury of the starry sky and silver fir grove. Bade farewell to
    </p>
    <p>
     my friend and the General. The old soldier was very kind, and an interesting
    </p>
    <p>
     talker. He told me long stories of the Florida Seminole war, in which he took
    </p>
    <p>
     part, and invited me to visit him in Omaha. Calling Carlo, I scrambled home
    </p>
    <p>
     through the Indian Cañon gate, rejoicing, pitying the poor Professor and
    </p>
    <p>
     General, bound by clocks, almanacs, orders, duties, etc., and compelled to
    </p>
    <p>
     dwell with lowland care and dust and din, where Nature is covered and her
    </p>
    <p>
     voice smothered, while the poor, insignificant wan derer enjoys the freedom
    </p>
    <p>
     and glory of God's wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Apart from the human interest of my visit to-day, I greatly enjoyed Yosemite,
    </p>
    <p>
     which I had visited only once before, having spent eight days last spring in
    </p>
    <p>
     rambling amid its rocks and waters. Wherever we go in the mountains, or
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed in any of God's wild fields, we find more than we seek. Descending four
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand feet in a few hours, we enter a new world—climate, plants, sounds,
    </p>
    <p>
     inhabitants, and scenery all new or changed. Near camp the goldcup oak forms
    </p>
    <p>
     sheets of chaparral, on top of which we may make our beds. Going down the
    </p>
    <p>
     Indian Cañon we observe this little bush changing by regular gradations to a
    </p>
    <p>
     large bush, to a small tree, and then larger, until on the rocky taluses near the
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom of the valley we find it developed into a broad, wide-spreading, gnarled,
    </p>
    <p>
     picturesque tree from four to eight feet in diameter, and forty or fifty feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
     Innumerable are the forms of water displayed. Every gliding reach, cascade,
    </p>
    <p>
     and fall has characters of its own. Had a good view of the Vernal and Nevada,
    </p>
    <p>
     two of the main falls of the valley, less than a mile apart, and offering striking
    </p>
    <p>
     differences in voice, form, color, etc. The Vernal, four hundred feet high and
    </p>
    <p>
     about seventy- five or eighty feet wide, drops smoothly over a round-lipped
    </p>
    <p>
     precipice and forms a superb apron of embroidery, green and white, slightly
    </p>
    <p>
     folded and fluted, maintaining this form nearly to the bottom, where it is
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly veiled in quick-flying billows of spray and mist, in which the
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon sunbeams play with ravishing beauty of rainbow colors. The Nevada
    </p>
    <p>
     is white from its first appearance as it leaps out into the freedom of the air. At
    </p>
    <p>
     the head it presents a twisted appearance, by an overfolding of the current
    </p>
    <p>
     from striking on the side of its channel just before the first free out-bounding
    </p>
    <p>
     leap is made. About two thirds of the way down, the hurrying throng of cometshaped masses glance on an inclined part of the face of the precipice and are
    </p>
    <p>
     beaten into yet whiter foam, greatly expanded, and sent bounding outward,
    </p>
    <p>
     making an indescribably glorious show, especially when the afternoon
    </p>
    <p>
     sunshine is pouring into it. In this fall—one of the most wonderful in the
    </p>
    <p>
     world—the water does not seem to be under the dominion of ordinary laws, but
    </p>
    <p>
     rather as if it were a living creature, full of the strength of the mountains and
    </p>
    <p>
     their huge, wild joy.
    </p>
    <p>
     From beneath heavy throbbing blasts of spray the broken river is seen
    </p>
    <p>
     emerging in ragged boulder-chafed strips. These are speed ily gathered into a
    </p>
    <p>
     roaring torrent, showing that the young river is still gloriously alive. On it goes,
    </p>
    <p>
     shouting, roaring, exulting in its strength, passes through a gorge with sublime
    </p>
    <p>
     display of energy, then suddenly expands on a gently inclined pavement, down
    </p>
    <p>
     which it rushes in thin sheets and folds of lace-work into a quiet pool,—
    </p>
    <p>
     "Emerald Pool," as it is called,—a stopping-place, a period separating two grand
    </p>
    <p>
     sentences. Resting here long enough to part with its foam-bells and gray
    </p>
    <p>
     mixtures of air, it glides quietly to the verge of the Vernal precipice in a broad
    </p>
    <p>
     sheet and makes its new display in the Vernal Fall; then more rapids and rock
    </p>
    <p>
     tossings down the cañon, shaded by live oak, Douglas spruce, fir, maple, and
    </p>
    <p>
     dogwood. It receives the Illilouette tributary, and makes a long sweep out into
    </p>
    <p>
     the level, sun-filled valley to join the other streams which, like itself, have
    </p>
    <p>
     danced and sung their way down from snowy heights to form the main
    </p>
    <p>
     Merced—the river of Mercy. But of this there is no end, and life, when one
    </p>
    <p>
     thinks of it, is so short. Never mind, one day in the midst of these divine glories
    </p>
    <p>
     is well worth living and toiling and starving for.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before parting with Professor Butler he gave me a book, and I gave him one of
    </p>
    <p>
     my pencil sketches for his little son Henry, who is a favorite of mine. He used
    </p>
    <p>
     to make many visits to my room when I was a student. Never shall I forget his
    </p>
    <p>
     patriotic speeches for the Union, mounted on a tall stool, when he was only six
    </p>
    <p>
     years old.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems strange that visitors to Yosemite should be so little influenced by its
    </p>
    <p>
     novel grandeur, as if their eyes were bandaged and their ears stopped. Most of
    </p>
    <p>
     those I saw yesterday were looking down as if wholly unconscious of anything
    </p>
    <p>
     going on about them, while the sublime rocks were trembling with the tones of
    </p>
    <p>
     the mighty chanting congregation of waters gathered from all the mountains
    </p>
    <p>
     round about, making music that might draw angels out of heaven. Yet
    </p>
    <p>
     respectable-looking, even wise-looking people were fixing bits of worms on bent
    </p>
    <p>
     pieces of wire to catch trout. Sport they called it. Should church-goers try to
    </p>
    <p>
     pass the time fishing in baptismal fonts while dull sermons were being
    </p>
    <p>
     preached, the so-called sport might not be so bad; but to play in the Yosemite
    </p>
    <p>
     temple, seeking pleasure in the pain of fishes struggling for their lives, while
    </p>
    <p>
     God himself is preaching his sublimest water and stone sermons!
    </p>
    <p>
     The Happy Isles, Yosemite National Park
    </p>
    <p>
     Now I'm back at the camp-fire, and cannot help thinking about my recognition
    </p>
    <p>
     of my friend's presence in the valley while he was four or five miles away, and
    </p>
    <p>
     while I had no means of knowing that he was not thousands of miles away. It
    </p>
    <p>
     seems supernatural, but only because it is not understood. Anyhow, it seems
    </p>
    <p>
     silly to make so much of it, while the natural and common is more truly
    </p>
    <p>
     marvelous and mysterious than the so-called supernatural. Indeed most of the
    </p>
    <p>
     miracles we hear of are infinitely less wonderful than the commonest of natural
    </p>
    <p>
     phenomena, when fairly seen. Perhaps the invisible rays that struck me while I
    </p>
    <p>
     sat at work on the Dome are something like those which attract and repel
    </p>
    <p>
     people at first sight, concerning which so much nonsense has been written.
    </p>
    <p>
     The worst apparent effect of these mysterious odd things is blindness to all
    </p>
    <p>
     that is divinely common. Hawthorne, I fancy, could weave one of his weird
    </p>
    <p>
     romances out of this little telepathic episode, the one strange marvel of my life,
    </p>
    <p>
     probably replacing my good old Professor by an attractive woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . We were awakened this morning before daybreak by the furious
    </p>
    <p>
     barking of Carlo and Jack and the sound of stampeding sheep. Billy fled from
    </p>
    <p>
     his punk bed to the fire, and refused to stir into the darkness to try to gather
    </p>
    <p>
     the scattered flock, or ascertain the nature of the disturbance. It was a bear
    </p>
    <p>
     attack, as we afterward learned, and I suppose little was gained by attempting
    </p>
    <p>
     to do anything be fore daylight. Nevertheless, being anxious to know what was
    </p>
    <p>
     up, Carlo and I groped our way through the woods, guided by the rustling
    </p>
    <p>
     sound made by fragments of the flock, not fearing the bear, for I knew that the
    </p>
    <p>
     runaways would go from their enemy as far as possible and Carlo's nose was
    </p>
    <p>
     also to be depended upon. About half a mile east of the corral we overtook
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty or thirty of the flock and succeeded in driving them back; then turning
    </p>
    <p>
     to the westward, we traced another band of fugitives and got them back to the
    </p>
    <p>
     flock. After daybreak I discovered the remains of a sheep carcass, still warm,
    </p>
    <p>
     showing that Bruin must have been enjoying his early mutton breakfast while I
    </p>
    <p>
     was seeking the runaways. He had eaten about half of it. Six dead sheep lay in
    </p>
    <p>
     the corral, evidently smothered by the crowding and piling up of the flock
    </p>
    <p>
     against the side of the corral wall when the bear entered. Making a wide circuit
    </p>
    <p>
     of the camp, Carlo and I discovered a third band of fugitives and drove them
    </p>
    <p>
     back to camp. We also discovered another dead sheep half eaten, showing
    </p>
    <p>
     there had been two of the shaggy freebooters at this early breakfast. They were
    </p>
    <p>
     easily traced. They had each caught a sheep, jumped over the corral fence with
    </p>
    <p>
     them, carrying them as a cat carries a mouse, laid them at the foot of fir trees a
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred yards or so back from the corral, and eaten their fill. After breakfast I
    </p>
    <p>
     set out to seek more of the lost, and found seventy-five at a considerable
    </p>
    <p>
     distance from camp. In the afternoon I succeeded, with Carlo's help, in getting
    </p>
    <p>
     them back to the flock. I don't know whether all are together again or not. I
    </p>
    <p>
     shall make a big fire this evening and keep watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I asked Billy why he made his bed against the corral in rotten wood,
    </p>
    <p>
     when so many better places offered, he replied that he "wished to be as near
    </p>
    <p>
     the sheep as possible in case bears should attack them." Now that the bears
    </p>
    <p>
     have come, he has moved his bed to the far side of the camp, and seems afraid
    </p>
    <p>
     that he may be mistaken for a sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
     This has been mostly a sheep day, and of course studies have been
    </p>
    <p>
     interrupted. Nevertheless, the walk through the gloom of the woods before the
    </p>
    <p>
     dawn was worth while, and I have learned something about these noble bears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their tracks are very telling, and so are their breakfasts. Scarce a trace of
    </p>
    <p>
     clouds to-day, and of course our ordinary midday thunder is wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Enjoyed the grand illumination of the camp grove, last night, from the
    </p>
    <p>
     fire we made to frighten the bears—compensation for loss of sleep and sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
     The noble pillars of verdure, vividly aglow, seemed to shoot into the sky like
    </p>
    <p>
     the flames that lighted them. Nevertheless, one of the bears paid us another
    </p>
    <p>
     visit, as if more attracted than repelled by the fire, climbed into the corral,
    </p>
    <p>
     killed a sheep and made off with it without being seen, while still another was
    </p>
    <p>
     lost by trampling and suffocation against the side of the corral. Now that our
    </p>
    <p>
     mutton has been tasted, I suppose it will be difficult to put a stop to the
    </p>
    <p>
     ravages of these freebooters.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Don arrived to-day from the lowlands with provisions and a letter. On
    </p>
    <p>
     learning the losses he had sustained, he determined to move the flock at once
    </p>
    <p>
     to the Upper Tuolumne region, saying that the bears would be sure to visit the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp every night as long as we stayed, and that no fire or noise we might make
    </p>
    <p>
     would avail to frighten them. No clouds save a few thin, lustrous touches on
    </p>
    <p>
     the eastern horizon. Thunder heard in the distance.

     THE MONO TRAIL
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Early this morning bade good-bye to the bears and blessed silver fir
    </p>
    <p>
     camp, and moved slowly eastward along the Mono Trail. At sundown camped
    </p>
    <p>
     for the night on one of the many small flowery meadows so greatly enjoyed on
    </p>
    <p>
     my excursion to Lake Tenaya. The dusty, noisy flock seems outrageously
    </p>
    <p>
     foreign and out of place in these nature gardens, more so than bears among
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep. The harm they do goes to the heart, but glorious hope lifts above all the
    </p>
    <p>
     dust and din and bids me look forward to a good time coming, when money
    </p>
    <p>
     enough will be earned to enable me to go walking where I like in pure wildness,
    </p>
    <p>
     with what I can carry on my back, and when the bread-sack is empty, run
    </p>
    <p>
     down to the nearest point on the bread-line for more. Nor will these run-downs
    </p>
    <p>
     be blanks, for, whether up or down, every step and jump on these blessed
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains is full of fine lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
     ONE OF THE TRIBUTARY FOUNTAINS OF THE TUOLUMNE CAÑON
    </p>
    <p>
     WATERS, ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOFFMAN RANGE
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Camp at the west end of Lake Tenaya. Arriving early, I took a walk on
    </p>
    <p>
     the glacier-polished pavements along the north shore, and climbed the
    </p>
    <p>
     magnificent mountain rock at the east end of the lake, now shining in the late
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon light. Almost every yard of its surface shows the scoring and
    </p>
    <p>
     polishing action of a great glacier that enveloped it and swept heavily over its
    </p>
    <p>
     summit, though it is about two thousand feet high above the lake and ten
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand above sea-level. This majestic, ancient ice-flood came from the
    </p>
    <p>
     eastward, as the scoring and crushing of the surface shows. Even below the
    </p>
    <p>
     waters of the lake the rock in some places is still grooved and polished; the
    </p>
    <p>
     lapping of the waves and their disintegrating action have not as yet obliterated
    </p>
    <p>
     even the superficial marks of glaciation. In climbing the steepest polished
    </p>
    <p>
     places I had to take off shoes and stockings. A fine region this for study of
    </p>
    <p>
     glacial action in mountain-making. I found many charming plants: arctic
    </p>
    <p>
     daisies, phlox, white spiræa, bryanthus, and rock-ferns,—pellæa, cheilanthes,
    </p>
    <p>
     allosorus,—fringing weathered seams all the way up to the summit; and sturdy
    </p>
    <p>
     junipers, grand old gray and brown monuments, stood bravely erect on
    </p>
    <p>
     fissured spots here and there, telling storm and avalanche stories of hundreds
    </p>
    <p>
     of winters. The view of the lake from the top is, I think, the best of all. There is
    </p>
    <p>
     another rock, more striking in form than this, standing isolated at the head of
    </p>
    <p>
     the lake, but it is not more than half as high. It is a knob or knot of burnished
    </p>
    <p>
     granite, perhaps about a thousand feet high, apparently as flawless and strong
    </p>
    <p>
     in structure as a wave-worn pebble, and probably owes its existence to the
    </p>
    <p>
     superior resistance it offered to the action of the overflowing ice-flood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Made sketch of the lake, and sauntered back to camp, my iron-shod shoes
    </p>
    <p>
     clanking on the pavements disturbing the chipmunks and birds. After dark
    </p>
    <p>
     went out to the shore,—not a breath of air astir, the lake a perfect mirror
    </p>
    <p>
     reflecting the sky and mountains with their stars and trees and wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     sculpture, all their grandeur refined and doubled,—a marvelously impressive
    </p>
    <p>
     picture, that seemed to belong more to heaven than earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . I went ahead of the flock, and crossed over the divide between the
    </p>
    <p>
     Merced and Tuolumne Basins. The gap between the east end of the Hoffman
    </p>
    <p>
     spur and the mass of mountain rocks about Cathedral Peak, though
    </p>
    <p>
     roughened by ridges and waving folds, seems to be one of the channels of a
    </p>
    <p>
     broad ancient glacier that came from the mountains on the summit of the
    </p>
    <p>
     range. In crossing this divide the ice-river made an ascent of about five
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred feet from the Tuolumne meadows. This entire region must have been
    </p>
    <p>
     overswept by ice.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the top of the divide, and also from the big Tuolumne Meadows, the
    </p>
    <p>
     wonderful mountain called Cathedral Peak is in sight. From every point of view
    </p>
    <p>
     it shows marked individuality. It is a majestic temple of one stone, hewn from
    </p>
    <p>
     the living rock, and adorned with spires and pinnacles in regular cathedral
    </p>
    <p>
     style. The dwarf pines on the roof look like mosses. I hope some time to climb
    </p>
    <p>
     to it to say my prayers and hear the stone sermons.
    </p>
    <p>
     The big Tuolumne Meadows are flowery lawns, lying along the south fork of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Tuolumne River at a height of about eighty-five hundred to nine thousand feet
    </p>
    <p>
     above the sea, partially separated by forests and bars of glaciated granite. Here
    </p>
    <p>
     the mountains seem to have been cleared away or set back, so that wide-open
    </p>
    <p>
     views may be had in every direction. The upper end of the series lies at the
    </p>
    <p>
     base of Mount Lyell, the lower below the east end of the Hoffman Range, so the
    </p>
    <p>
     length must be about ten or twelve miles. They vary in width from a quarter of
    </p>
    <p>
     a mile to perhaps three quarters, and a good many branch meadows put out
    </p>
    <p>
     along the banks of the tributary streams. This is the most spacious and
    </p>
    <p>
     delightful high pleasure-ground I have yet seen. The air is keen and bracing,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet warm during the day; and though lying high in the sky, the surrounding
    </p>
    <p>
     moun tains are so much higher, one feels protected as if in a grand hall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mounts Dana and Gibbs, massive red mountains, perhaps thirteen thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     feet high or more, bound the view on the east, the Cathedral and Unicorn
    </p>
    <p>
     Peaks, with many nameless peaks, on the south, the Hoffman Range on the
    </p>
    <p>
     west, and a number of peaks unnamed, as far as I know, on the north. One of
    </p>
    <p>
     these last is much like the Cathedral. The grass of the meadows is mostly fine
    </p>
    <p>
     and silky, with exceedingly slender leaves, making a close sod, above which the
    </p>
    <p>
     panicles of minute purple flowers seem to float in airy, misty lightness, while
    </p>
    <p>
     the sod is enriched with at least three species of gentian and as many or more
    </p>
    <p>
     of orthocarpus, potentilla, ivesia, solidago, pentstemon, with their gay colors,—
    </p>
    <p>
     purple, blue, yellow, and red,—all of which I may know better ere long. A
    </p>
    <p>
     central camp will probably be made in this region, from which I hope to make
    </p>
    <p>
     long excursions into the surrounding mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the return trip I met the flock about three miles east of Lake Tenaya. Here
    </p>
    <p>
     we camped for the night near a small lake lying on top of the divide in a clump
    </p>
    <p>
     of the two-leaved pine. We are now about nine thousand feet above the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Small lakes abound in all sorts of situations,—on ridges, along mountain sides,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in piles of moraine boulders, most of them mere pools. Only in those
    </p>
    <p>
     cañons of the larger streams at the foot of declivities, where the down thrust of
    </p>
    <p>
     the glaciers was heaviest, do we find lakes of considerable size and depth. How
    </p>
    <p>
     grateful a task it would be to trace them all and study them! How pure their
    </p>
    <p>
     waters are, clear as crystal in polished stone basins! None of them, so far as I
    </p>
    <p>
     have seen, have fishes, I suppose on account of falls making them inaccessible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet one would think their eggs might get into these lakes by some chance or
    </p>
    <p>
     other; on ducks' feet, for example, or in their mouths, or in their crops, as
    </p>
    <p>
     some plant seeds are distributed. Nature has so many ways of doing such
    </p>
    <p>
     things. How did the frogs, found in all the bogs and pools and lakes, however
    </p>
    <p>
     high, manage to get up these mountains? Surely not by jumping. Such
    </p>
    <p>
     excursions through miles of dry brush and boulders would be very hard on
    </p>
    <p>
     frogs. Perhaps their stringy gelatinous spawn is occasionally entangled or glued
    </p>
    <p>
     on the feet of water birds. Anyhow, they are here and in hearty health and
    </p>
    <p>
     voice. I like their cheery tronk and crink. They take the place of songbirds at a
    </p>
    <p>
     pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Another of those charming exhilarating days that make the blood
    </p>
    <p>
     dance and excite nerve currents that render one unweariable and well-nigh
    </p>
    <p>
     immortal. Had an other view of the broad ice-ploughed divide, and gazed again
    </p>
    <p>
     and again at the Sierra temple and the great red mountains east of the
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
     We are camped near the Soda Springs on the north side of the river. A hard
    </p>
    <p>
     time we had getting the sheep across. They were driven into a horseshoe bend
    </p>
    <p>
     and fairly crowded off the bank. They seemed willing to suffer death rather
    </p>
    <p>
     than risk getting wet, though they swim well enough when they have to. Why
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep should be so unreasonably afraid of water, I don't know, but they do fear
    </p>
    <p>
     it as soon as they are born and perhaps before. I once saw a lamb only a few
    </p>
    <p>
     hours old approach a shallow stream about two feet wide and an inch deep,
    </p>
    <p>
     after it had walked only about a hundred yards on its life journey. All the flock
    </p>
    <p>
     to which it belonged had crossed this inch-deep stream, and as the mother and
    </p>
    <p>
     her lamb were the last to cross, I had a good opportunity to observe them. As
    </p>
    <p>
     soon as the flock was out of the way, the anxious mother crossed over and
    </p>
    <p>
     called the youngster. It walked cautiously to the brink, gazed at the water,
    </p>
    <p>
     bleated piteously, and refused to venture. The patient mother went back to it
    </p>
    <p>
     again and again to encourage it, but long without avail. Like the pilgrim on
    </p>
    <p>
     Jordan's stormy bank it feared to launch away. At length, gathering its
    </p>
    <p>
     trembling inexperienced legs for the mighty effort, throwing up its head as if it
    </p>
    <p>
     knew all about drowning, and was anxious to keep its nose above water, it
    </p>
    <p>
     made the tremendous leap, and landed in the middle of the inch-deep stream.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed astonished to find that, instead of sinking over head and ears, only
    </p>
    <p>
     its toes were wet, gazed at the shining water a few seconds, and then sprang to
    </p>
    <p>
     the shore safe and dry through the dreadful adventure. All kinds of wild sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     are mountain animals, and their descendants' dread of water is not easily
    </p>
    <p>
     accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Fine shining weather, with a ten minutes' noon thunderstorm and
    </p>
    <p>
     rain. Rambling all day getting acquainted with the region north of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
     Found a small lake and many charming glacier meadows embosomed in an
    </p>
    <p>
     extensive forest of the two-leaved pine. The forest is growing on broad, almost
    </p>
    <p>
     continuous deposits of moraine material, is remarkably even in its growth, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the trees are much closer together than in any of the fir or pine woods farther
    </p>
    <p>
     down the range. The evenness of the growth would seem to indicate that the
    </p>
    <p>
     trees are all of the same age or nearly so. This regularity has probably been in
    </p>
    <p>
     great part the result of fire. I saw several large patches and strips of dead
    </p>
    <p>
     bleached spars, the ground beneath them covered with a young even growth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fire can run in these woods, not only because the thin bark of the trees is
    </p>
    <p>
     dripping with resin, but because the growth is close, and the comparatively
    </p>
    <p>
     rich soil produces good crops of tall broad-leaved grasses on which fire can
    </p>
    <p>
     travel, even when the weather is calm. Besides these fire-killed patches there
    </p>
    <p>
     are a good many fallen uprooted trees here and there, some with the bark and
    </p>
    <p>
     needles still on, as if they had lately been blown down in some thunderstorm
    </p>
    <p>
     blast. Saw a large black-tailed deer, a buck with antlers like the upturned roots
    </p>
    <p>
     of a fallen pine.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a long ramble through the dense encumbered woods I emerged upon a
    </p>
    <p>
     smooth meadow full of sunshine like a lake of light, about a mile and a half
    </p>
    <p>
     long, a quarter to half a mile wide, and bounded by tall arrowy pines. The sod,
    </p>
    <p>
     like that of all the glacier meadows hereabouts, is made of silky agrostis and
    </p>
    <p>
     calamagrostis chiefly; their panicles of purple flowers and purple stems,
    </p>
    <p>
     exceedingly light and airy, seem to float above the green plush of leaves like a
    </p>
    <p>
     thin misty cloud, while the sod is brightened by several species of gentian,
    </p>
    <p>
     potentilla, ivesia, orthocarpus, and their corresponding bees and butterflies. All
    </p>
    <p>
     the glacier meadows are beautiful, but few are so perfect as this one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Compared with it the most carefully leveled, licked, snipped artificial lawns of
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasure-grounds are coarse things. I should like to live here always. It is so
    </p>
    <p>
     calm and withdrawn while open to the universe in full communion with
    </p>
    <p>
     everything good. To the north of this glorious meadow I discovered the camp of
    </p>
    <p>
     some Indian hunters. Their fire was still burning, but they had not yet returned
    </p>
    <p>
     from the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     From meadow to meadow, every one beautiful beyond telling, and from lake to
    </p>
    <p>
     lake through groves and belts of arrowy trees, I held my way northward toward
    </p>
    <p>
     Mount Conness, finding telling beauty everywhere, while the encompassing
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains were calling "Come." Hope I may climb them all.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . The sky-scenery has changed but little so far with the change in
    </p>
    <p>
     elevation. Clouds about .. Glorious pearly cumuli tinted with purple of ineffable
    </p>
    <p>
     fineness of tone. Moved camp to the side of the glacier meadow mentioned
    </p>
    <p>
     above. To let sheep trample so divinely fine a place seems barbarous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately they prefer the succulent broad-leaved triticum and other
    </p>
    <p>
     woodland grasses to the silky species of the meadows, and therefore seldom
    </p>
    <p>
     bite them or set foot on them.
    </p>
    <p>
     GLACIER MEADOW, ON THE HEADWATERS OF THE TUOLUMNE FEET
    </p>
    <p>
     ABOVE THE SEA
    </p>
    <p>
     The shepherd and the Don cannot agree about methods of herding. Billy sets
    </p>
    <p>
     his dog Jack on the sheep far too often, so the Don thinks; and after some
    </p>
    <p>
     dispute to-day, in which the shepherd loudly claimed the right to dog the sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     as often as he pleased, he started for the plains. Now I suppose the care of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep will fall on me, though Mr. Delaney promises to do the herding himself
    </p>
    <p>
     for a while, then return to the lowlands and bring another shepherd, so as to
    </p>
    <p>
     leave me free to rove as I like.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had another rich ramble. Pushed northward beyond the forests to the head of
    </p>
    <p>
     the general basin, where traces of glacial action are strikingly clear and
    </p>
    <p>
     interesting. The recesses among the peaks look like quarries, so raw and fresh
    </p>
    <p>
     are the moraine chips and boulders that strew the ground in Nature's glacial
    </p>
    <p>
     workshops.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon after my return to camp we received a visit from an Indian, probably one
    </p>
    <p>
     of the hunters whose camp I had discovered. He came from Mono, he said, with
    </p>
    <p>
     others of his tribe, to hunt deer. One that he had killed a short distance from
    </p>
    <p>
     here he was carrying on his back, its legs tied together in an ornamental bunch
    </p>
    <p>
     on his forehead. Throwing down his burden, he gazed stolidly for a few minutes
    </p>
    <p>
     in silent Indian fashion, then cut off eight or ten pounds of venison for us, and
    </p>
    <p>
     begged a "lill" little of everything he saw or could think of—flour, bread, sugar,
    </p>
    <p>
     tobacco, whiskey, needles, etc. We gave a fair price for the meat in flour and
    </p>
    <p>
     sugar and added a few needles. A strangely dirty and irregular life these darkeyed, dark-haired, half-happy savages lead in this clean wilderness,—
    </p>
    <p>
     starvation and abundance, deathlike calm, indolence, and admirable,
    </p>
    <p>
     indefatigable action succeeding each other in stormy rhythm like winter and
    </p>
    <p>
     summer. Two things they have that civilized toilers might well envy them—pure
    </p>
    <p>
     air and pure water. These go far to cover and cure the grossness of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their food is mostly good berries, pine nuts, clover, lily bulbs, wild sheep,
    </p>
    <p>
     antelope, deer, grouse, sage hens, and the larvæ of ants, wasps, bees, and
    </p>
    <p>
     other insects.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Day all sunshine, dawn and evening purple, noon gold, no clouds, air
    </p>
    <p>
     motionless. Mr. Delaney arrived with two shepherds, one of them an Indian. On
    </p>
    <p>
     his way up from the plains he left some provisions at the Portuguese camp on
    </p>
    <p>
     Porcupine Creek near our old Yosemite camp, and I set out this morning with
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the pack animals to fetch them. Arrived at the Porcupine camp at noon,
    </p>
    <p>
     and might have returned to the Tuolumne late in the evening, but concluded
    </p>
    <p>
     to stay over night with the Portuguese shepherds at their pressing invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had sad stories to tell of losses from the Yosemite bears, and were so
    </p>
    <p>
     discouraged they seemed on the point of leaving the mountains; for the bears
    </p>
    <p>
     came every night and helped themselves to one or several of the flock in spite of
    </p>
    <p>
     all their efforts to keep them off.
    </p>
    <p>
     I spent the afternoon in a grand ramble along the Yosemite walls. From the
    </p>
    <p>
     highest of the rocks called the Three Brothers, I enjoyed a magnificent view
    </p>
    <p>
     comprehending all the upper half of the floor of the valley and nearly all the
    </p>
    <p>
     rocks of the walls on both sides and at the head, with snowy peaks in the
    </p>
    <p>
     background. Saw also the Vernal and Nevada Falls, a truly glorious picture,—
    </p>
    <p>
     rocky strength and permanence combined with beauty of plants frail and fine
    </p>
    <p>
     and evanescent; water descending in thunder, and the same water gliding
    </p>
    <p>
     through meadows and groves in gentlest beauty. This standpoint is about eight
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand feet above the sea, or four thousand feet above the floor of the valley,
    </p>
    <p>
     and every tree, though looking small and feathery, stands in admirable
    </p>
    <p>
     clearness, and the shadows they cast are as distinct in outline as if seen at a
    </p>
    <p>
     distance of a few yards. They appeared even more so. No words will ever
    </p>
    <p>
     describe the exquisite beauty and charm of this mountain park—Nature's
    </p>
    <p>
     landscape garden at once tenderly beautiful and sublime. No wonder it draws
    </p>
    <p>
     nature-lovers from all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glacial action even on this lofty summit is plainly displayed. Not only has all
    </p>
    <p>
     the lovely valley now smiling in sunshine been filled to the brim with ice, but it
    </p>
    <p>
     has been deeply overflowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     I visited our old Yosemite camp-ground on the head of Indian Creek, and found
    </p>
    <p>
     it fairly patted and smoothed down with bear-tracks. The bears had eaten all
    </p>
    <p>
     the sheep that were smothered in the corral, and some of the grand animals
    </p>
    <p>
     must have died, for Mr. Delaney, before leaving camp, put a large quantity of
    </p>
    <p>
     poison in the carcasses. All sheep-men carry strychnine to kill coyotes, bears,
    </p>
    <p>
     and panthers, though neither coyotes nor panthers are at all numerous in the
    </p>
    <p>
     upper mountains. The little dog-like wolves are far more numerous in the
    </p>
    <p>
     foothill region and on the plains, where they find a better supply of food,—saw
    </p>
    <p>
     only one panther-track above eight thousand feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Three Brothers, Yosemite National Park
    </p>
    <p>
     On my return after sunset to the Portuguese camp I found the shepherds
    </p>
    <p>
     greatly excited over the behavior of the bears that have learned to like mutton.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They are getting worse and worse," they lamented. Not willing to wait decently
    </p>
    <p>
     until after dark for their suppers, they come and kill and eat their fill in broad
    </p>
    <p>
     daylight. The evening before my arrival, when the two shepherds were leisurely
    </p>
    <p>
     driving the flock toward camp half an hour before sunset, a hungry bear came
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the chaparral within a few yards of them and shuffled deliberately
    </p>
    <p>
     toward the flock. "Portuguese Joe," who always carried a gun loaded with
    </p>
    <p>
     buckshot, fired excitedly, threw down his gun, fled to the nearest suitable tree,
    </p>
    <p>
     and climbed to a safe height without waiting to see the effect of his shot. His
    </p>
    <p>
     companion also ran, but said that he saw the bear rise on its hind legs and
    </p>
    <p>
     throw out its arms as if feeling for somebody, and then go into the brush as if
    </p>
    <p>
     wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
     At another of their camps in this neighborhood, a bear with two cubs attacked
    </p>
    <p>
     the flock before sunset, just as they were approaching the corral. Joe promptly
    </p>
    <p>
     climbed a tree out of danger, while Antone, rebuking his companion for
    </p>
    <p>
     cowardice in abandoning his charge, said that he was not going to let bears
    </p>
    <p>
     "eat up his sheeps" in daylight, and rushed towards the bears, shouting and
    </p>
    <p>
     setting his dog on them. The frightened cubs climbed a tree, but the mother
    </p>
    <p>
     ran to meet the shepherd and seemed anxious to fight. Antone stood
    </p>
    <p>
     astonished for a moment, eyeing the oncoming bear, then turned and fled,
    </p>
    <p>
     closely pursued. Unable to reach a suitable tree for climbing, he ran to the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp and scrambled up to the roof of the little cabin; the bear followed, but did
    </p>
    <p>
     not climb to the roof,—only stood glaring up at him for a few minutes,
    </p>
    <p>
     threatening him and holding him in mortal terror, then went to her cubs, called
    </p>
    <p>
     them down, went to the flock, caught a sheep for supper, and vanished in the
    </p>
    <p>
     brush. As soon as the bear left the cabin, the trembling Antone begged Joe to
    </p>
    <p>
     show him a good safe tree, up which he climbed like a sailor climbing a mast,
    </p>
    <p>
     and remained as long as he could hold on, the tree being almost branchless.
    </p>
    <p>
     After these disastrous experiences the two shepherds chopped and gathered
    </p>
    <p>
     large piles of dry wood and made a ring of fire around the corral every night,
    </p>
    <p>
     while one with a gun kept watch from a comfortable stage built on a
    </p>
    <p>
     neighboring pine that commanded a view of the corral. This evening the show
    </p>
    <p>
     made by the circle of fire was very fine, bringing out the surrounding trees in
    </p>
    <p>
     most impressive relief, and making the thousands of sheep eyes glow like a
    </p>
    <p>
     glorious bed of diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Up to the time I went to bed last night all was quiet, though we
    </p>
    <p>
     expected the shaggy freebooters every minute. They did not come till near
    </p>
    <p>
     midnight, when a pair walked boldly to the corral between two of the great
    </p>
    <p>
     fires, climbed in, killed two sheep and smothered ten, while the frightened
    </p>
    <p>
     watcher in the tree did not fire a single shot, saying that he was afraid he might
    </p>
    <p>
     kill some of the sheep, for the bears got into the corral before he got a good
    </p>
    <p>
     clear view of them. I told the shepherds they should at once move the flock to
    </p>
    <p>
     another camp. "Oh, no use, no use," they lamented; "where we go, the bears go
    </p>
    <p>
     too. See my poor dead sheeps—soon all dead. No use try another camp. We go
    </p>
    <p>
     down to the plains." And as I afterwards learned, they were driven out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains a month before the usual time. Were bears much more numerous
    </p>
    <p>
     and destructive, the sheep would be kept away altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems strange that bears, so fond of all sorts of flesh, running the risks of
    </p>
    <p>
     guns and fires and poison, should never attack men except in defense of their
    </p>
    <p>
     young. How easily and safely a bear could pick us up as we lie asleep! Only
    </p>
    <p>
     wolves and tigers seem to have learned to hunt man for food, and perhaps
    </p>
    <p>
     sharks and crocodiles. Mosquitoes and other insects would, I suppose, devour
    </p>
    <p>
     a helpless man in some parts of the world, and so might lions, leopards,
    </p>
    <p>
     wolves, hyenas, and panthers at times if pressed by hunger,—but under
    </p>
    <p>
     ordinary circumstances, perhaps, only the tiger among land animals may be
    </p>
    <p>
     said to be a man-eater,—unless we add man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clouds as usual about .. Another glorious Sierra day, warm, crisp, fragrant,
    </p>
    <p>
     and clear. Many of the flowering plants have gone to seed, but many others are
    </p>
    <p>
     unfolding their petals every day, and the firs and pines are more fragrant than
    </p>
    <p>
     ever. Their seeds are nearly ripe, and will soon be flying in the merriest flocks
    </p>
    <p>
     that ever spread a wing.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the way back to our Tuolumne camp, I enjoyed the scenery if possible more
    </p>
    <p>
     than when it first came to view. Every feature already seems familiar as if I had
    </p>
    <p>
     lived here always. I never weary gazing at the wonderful Cathedral. It has more
    </p>
    <p>
     individual character than any other rock or mountain I ever saw, excepting
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps the Yosemite South Dome. The forests, too, seem kindly familiar, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the lakes and meadows and glad singing streams. I should like to dwell with
    </p>
    <p>
     them forever. Here with bread and water I should be content. Even if not
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed to roam and climb, tethered to a stake or tree in some meadow or
    </p>
    <p>
     grove, even then I should be con tent forever. Bathed in such beauty, watching,
    </p>
    <p>
     the expressions ever varying on the faces of the mountains, watching the stars,
    </p>
    <p>
     which here have a glory that the lowlander never dreams of, watching the
    </p>
    <p>
     circling seasons, listening to the songs of the waters and winds and birds,
    </p>
    <p>
     would be endless pleasure. And what glorious cloudlands I should see, storms
    </p>
    <p>
     and calms,—a new heaven and a new earth every day, aye and new
    </p>
    <p>
     inhabitants. And how many visitors I should have. I feel sure I should not have
    </p>
    <p>
     one dull moment. And why should this appear extravagant? It is only common
    </p>
    <p>
     sense, a sign of health, genuine, natural, all-awake health. One would be at an
    </p>
    <p>
     endless Godful play, and what speeches and music and acting and scenery and
    </p>
    <p>
     lights!—sun, moon, stars, auroras. Creation just beginning, the morning stars
    </p>
    <p>
     "still singing together and all the sons of God shouting for joy."

    <p>
     BLOODY CAÑON AND MONO LAKE
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Have just returned from a fine wild excursion across the range to
    </p>
    <p>
     Mono Lake, by way of the Mono or Bloody Cañon Pass. Mr. Delaney has been
    </p>
    <p>
     good to me all summer, lending a helping, sympathizing hand at every
    </p>
    <p>
     opportunity, as if my wild notions and rambles and studies were his own. He is
    </p>
    <p>
     one of those remarkable California men who have been overflowed and
    </p>
    <p>
     denuded and remodeled by the excitements of the gold fields, like the Sierra
    </p>
    <p>
     landscapes by grinding ice, bringing the harder bosses and ridges of character
    </p>
    <p>
     into relief,—a tall, lean, big-boned, big-hearted Irishman, educated for a priest
    </p>
    <p>
     in Maynooth College,—lots of good in him, shining out now and then in this
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain light. Recognizing my love of wild places, he told me one evening that
    </p>
    <p>
     I ought to go through Bloody Cañon, for he was sure I should find it wild
    </p>
    <p>
     enough. He had not been there himself, he said, but had heard many of his
    </p>
    <p>
     mining friends speak of it as the wildest of all the Sierra passes. Of course I
    </p>
    <p>
     was glad to go. It lies just to the east of our camp and swoops down from the
    </p>
    <p>
     summit of the range to the edge of the Mono Desert, making a descent of about
    </p>
    <p>
     four thousand feet in a distance of about four miles. It was known and traveled
    </p>
    <p>
     as a pass by wild animals and the Indians long before its discovery by white
    </p>
    <p>
     men in the gold year of , as is shown by old trails which come together at the
    </p>
    <p>
     head of it. The name may have been suggested by the red color of the
    </p>
    <p>
     metamorphic slates in which the cañon abounds, or by the blood stains on the
    </p>
    <p>
     rocks from the unfortunate animals that were compelled to slide and shuffle
    </p>
    <p>
     over the sharp-angled boulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Early in the morning I tied my notebook and some bread to my belt, and strode
    </p>
    <p>
     away full of eager hope, feeling that I was going to have a glorious revel. The
    </p>
    <p>
     glacier meadows that lay along my way served to soothe my morning speed, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the sod was full of blue gentians and daisies, kalmia and dwarf vaccinium,
    </p>
    <p>
     calling for recognition as old friends, and I had to stop many times to examine
    </p>
    <p>
     the shining rocks over which the ancient glacier had passed with tremendous
    </p>
    <p>
     pressure, polishing them so well that they reflected the sunlight like glass in
    </p>
    <p>
     some places, while fine striæ, seen clearly through a lens, indicated the
    </p>
    <p>
     direction in which the ice had flowed. On some of the sloping polished
    </p>
    <p>
     pavements abrupt steps occur, showing that occasionally large masses of the
    </p>
    <p>
     rock had given way before the glacial pressure, as well as small particles;
    </p>
    <p>
     moraines, too, some scattered, others regular like long curving embankments
    </p>
    <p>
     and dams, occur here and there, giving the general surface of the region a
    </p>
    <p>
     young, new-made appearance. I watched the gradual dwarfing of the pines as I
    </p>
    <p>
     ascended, and the corresponding dwarfing of nearly all the rest of the
    </p>
    <p>
     vegetation. On the slopes of Mammoth Mountain, to the south of the pass, I
    </p>
    <p>
     saw many gaps in the woods reaching from the upper edge of the timber-line
    </p>
    <p>
     down to the level meadows, where avalanches of snow had descended,
    </p>
    <p>
     sweeping away every tree in their paths as well as the soil they were growing in,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving the bedrock bare. The trees are nearly all uprooted, but a few that had
    </p>
    <p>
     been extremely well anchored in clefts of the rock were broken off near the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground. It seems strange at first sight that trees that had been allowed to grow
    </p>
    <p>
     for a century or more undisturbed should in their old age be thus swished
    </p>
    <p>
     away at a stroke. Such avalanches can only occur under rare conditions of
    </p>
    <p>
     weather and snowfall. No doubt on some positions of the mountain slopes the
    </p>
    <p>
     inclination and smoothness of the surface is such that avalanches must occur
    </p>
    <p>
     every winter, or even after every heavy snowstorm, and of course no trees or
    </p>
    <p>
     even bushes can grow in their channels. I noticed a few clean-swept slopes of
    </p>
    <p>
     this kind. The uprooted trees that had grown in the pathway of what might be
    </p>
    <p>
     called "century avalanches" were piled in windrows, and tucked snugly against
    </p>
    <p>
     the wall-trees of the gaps, heads downward, excepting a few that were carried
    </p>
    <p>
     out into the open ground of the meadows, where the heads of the avalanches
    </p>
    <p>
     had stopped. Young pines, mostly the two-leaved and the white-barked, are
    </p>
    <p>
     already springing up in these cleared gaps. It would be interesting to ascertain
    </p>
    <p>
     the age of these saplings, for thus we should gain a fair approximation to the
    </p>
    <p>
     year that the great avalanches occurred. Perhaps most or all of them occurred
    </p>
    <p>
     the same winter. How glad I should be if free to pursue such studies!
    </p>
    <p>
     Near the summit at the head of the pass I found a species of dwarf willow lying
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly flat on the ground, making a nice, soft, silky gray carpet, not a single
    </p>
    <p>
     stem or branch more than three inches high; but the catkins, which are now
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly ripe, stand erect and make a close, nearly regular gray growth, being
    </p>
    <p>
     larger than all the rest of the plants. Some of these interesting dwarfs have only
    </p>
    <p>
     one catkin —willow bushes reduced to their lowest terms. I found patches of
    </p>
    <p>
     dwarf vaccinium also forming smooth carpets, closely pressed to the ground or
    </p>
    <p>
     against the sides of stones, and covered with round pink flowers in lavish
    </p>
    <p>
     abundance as if they had fallen from the sky like hail. A little higher, almost at
    </p>
    <p>
     the very head of the pass, I found the blue arctic daisy and purple-flowered
    </p>
    <p>
     bryanthus, the mountain's own darlings, gentle mountaineers face to face with
    </p>
    <p>
     the sky, kept safe and warm by a thousand miracles, seeming always the finer
    </p>
    <p>
     and purer the wilder and stormier their homes. The trees, tough and resiny,
    </p>
    <p>
     seem unable to go a step farther; but up and up, far above the tree-line, these
    </p>
    <p>
     tender plants climb, cheerily spreading their gray and pink carpets right up to
    </p>
    <p>
     the very edges of the snow-banks in deep hollows and shadows. Here, too, is
    </p>
    <p>
     the familiar robin, tripping on the flowery lawns, bravely singing the same
    </p>
    <p>
     cheery song I first heard when a boy in Wisconsin newly arrived from old
    </p>
    <p>
     Scotland. In this fine company sauntering enchanted, taking no heed of time, I
    </p>
    <p>
     at length entered the gate of the pass, and the huge rocks began to close
    </p>
    <p>
     around me in all their mysterious impressiveness. Just then I was startled by a
    </p>
    <p>
     lot of queer, hairy, muffled creatures coming shuffling, shambling, wallow ing
    </p>
    <p>
     toward me as if they had no bones in their bodies. Had I discovered them while
    </p>
    <p>
     they were yet a good way off, I should have tried to avoid them. What a picture
    </p>
    <p>
     they made contrasted with the others I had just been admiring. When I came
    </p>
    <p>
     up to them, I found that they were only a band of Indians from Mono on their
    </p>
    <p>
     way to Yosemite for a load of acorns. They were wrapped in blankets made of
    </p>
    <p>
     the skins of sage-rabbits. The dirt on some of the faces seemed almost old
    </p>
    <p>
     enough and thick enough to have a geological significance; some were strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     blurred and divided into sections by seams and wrinkles that looked like
    </p>
    <p>
     cleavage joints, and had a worn abraded look as if they had lain exposed to the
    </p>
    <p>
     weather for ages. I tried to pass them without stopping, but they wouldn't let
    </p>
    <p>
     me; forming a dismal circle about me, I was closely besieged while they begged
    </p>
    <p>
     whiskey or tobacco, and it was hard to convince them that I hadn't any. How
    </p>
    <p>
     glad I was to get away from the gray, grim crowd and see them vanish down the
    </p>
    <p>
     trail! Yet it seems sad to feel such desperate repulsion from one's fellow beings,
    </p>
    <p>
     however degraded. To prefer the society of squirrels and woodchucks to that of
    </p>
    <p>
     our own species must surely be unnatural. So with a fresh breeze and a hill or
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain between us I must wish them Godspeed and try to pray and sing
    </p>
    <p>
     with Burns, "It's coming yet, for a' that, that man to man, the warld o'er, shall
    </p>
    <p>
     brothers be for a' that."
    </p>
    <p>
     How the day passed I hardly know. By the map I have come only about ten or
    </p>
    <p>
     twelve miles, though the sun is already low in the west, showing how long I
    </p>
    <p>
     must have lingered, observing, sketching, taking notes among the glaciated
    </p>
    <p>
     rocks and moraines and Alpine flower-beds.
    </p>
    <p>
     At sundown the somber crags and peaks were inspired with the ineffable
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty of the alpenglow, and a solemn, awful stillness hushed everything in the
    </p>
    <p>
     landscape. Then I crept into a hollow by the side of a small lake near the head
    </p>
    <p>
     of the cañon, smoothed a sheltered spot, and gathered a few pine tassels for a
    </p>
    <p>
     bed. After the short twilight began to fade I kindled a sunny fire, made a tin
    </p>
    <p>
     cupful of tea, and lay down to watch the stars. Soon the night-wind began to
    </p>
    <p>
     flow from the snowy peaks overhead, at first only a gentle breathing, then
    </p>
    <p>
     gaining strength, in less than an hour rumbled in massive volume something
    </p>
    <p>
     like a boisterous stream in a boulder-choked channel, roaring and moaning
    </p>
    <p>
     down the cañon as if the work it had to do was tremendously important and
    </p>
    <p>
     fateful; and mingled with these storm tones were those of the waterfalls on the
    </p>
    <p>
     north side of the cañon, now sounding distinctly, now smothered by the
    </p>
    <p>
     heavier cataracts of air, making a glorious psalm of savage wildness. My fire
    </p>
    <p>
     squirmed and struggled as if ill at ease, for though in a sheltered nook,
    </p>
    <p>
     detached masses of icy wind often fell like icebergs on top of it, scattering
    </p>
    <p>
     sparks and coals, so that I had to keep well back to avoid being burned. But
    </p>
    <p>
     the big resiny roots and knots of the dwarf pine could neither be beaten out nor
    </p>
    <p>
     blown away, and the flames, now rushing up in long lances, now flattened and
    </p>
    <p>
     twisted on the rocky ground, roared as if trying to tell the storm stories of the
    </p>
    <p>
     trees they belonged to, as the light given out was telling the story of the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunshine they had gathered in centuries of summers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The stars shone clear in the strip of sky between the huge dark cliffs; and as I
    </p>
    <p>
     lay recalling the lessons of the day, suddenly the full moon looked down over
    </p>
    <p>
     the cañon wall, her face apparently filled with eager concern, which had a
    </p>
    <p>
     startling effect, as if she had left her place in the sky and had come down to
    </p>
    <p>
     gaze on me alone, like a person entering one's bedroom. It was hard to realize
    </p>
    <p>
     that she was in her place in the sky, and was looking abroad on half the globe,
    </p>
    <p>
     land and sea, mountains, plains, lakes, rivers, oceans, ships, cities with their
    </p>
    <p>
     myriads of inhabitants sleeping and waking, sick and well. No, she seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     be just on the rim of Bloody Cañon and looking only at me. This was indeed
    </p>
    <p>
     getting near to Nature. I remember watching the harvest moon rising above the
    </p>
    <p>
     oak trees in Wisconsin apparently as big as a cart-wheel and not farther than
    </p>
    <p>
     half a mile distant. With these exceptions I might say I never before had seen
    </p>
    <p>
     the moon, and this night she seemed so full of life and so near, the effect was
    </p>
    <p>
     marvelously impressive and made me forget the Indians, the great black rocks
    </p>
    <p>
     above me, and the wild uproar of the winds and waters making their way down
    </p>
    <p>
     the huge jagged gorge. Of course I slept but little and gladly welcomed the
    </p>
    <p>
     dawn over the Mono Desert. By the time I had made a cupful of tea the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunbeams were pouring through the cañon, and I set forth, gazing eagerly at
    </p>
    <p>
     the tremendous walls of red slates savagely hacked and scarred and apparently
    </p>
    <p>
     ready to fall in avalanches great enough to choke the pass and fill up the chain
    </p>
    <p>
     of lakelets. But soon its beauties came to view, and I bounded lightly from rock
    </p>
    <p>
     to rock, admiring the polished bosses shining in the slant sunshine with
    </p>
    <p>
     glorious effect in the general roughness of moraines and avalanche taluses,
    </p>
    <p>
     even toward the head of the cañon near the highest fountains of the ice. Here,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, are most of the lowly plant people seen yesterday on the other side of the
    </p>
    <p>
     divide now opening their beautiful eyes. None could fail to glory in Nature's
    </p>
    <p>
     tender care for them in so wild a place. The little ouzel is flitting from rock to
    </p>
    <p>
     rock along the rapid swirling Cañon Creek, diving for breakfast in icy pools,
    </p>
    <p>
     and merrily singing as if the huge rugged avalanche-swept gorge was the most
    </p>
    <p>
     delightful of all its mountain homes. Besides a high fall on the north wall of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cañon, apparently coming direct from the sky, there are many narrow
    </p>
    <p>
     cascades, bright silvery ribbons zigzagging down the red cliffs, tracing the
    </p>
    <p>
     diagonal cleavage joints of the metamorphic slates, now contracted and out of
    </p>
    <p>
     sight, now leaping from ledge to ledge in filmy sheets through which the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunbeams sift. And on the main Cañon Creek, to which all these are tributary,
    </p>
    <p>
     is a series of small falls, cascades, and rapids extending all the way down to
    </p>
    <p>
     the foot of the cañon, interrupted only by the lakes in which the tossed and
    </p>
    <p>
     beaten waters rest. One of the finest of the cascades is outspread on the face of
    </p>
    <p>
     a precipice, its waters separated into ribbon-like strips, and woven into a
    </p>
    <p>
     diamond-like pattern by tracing the cleavage joints of the rock, while tufts of
    </p>
    <p>
     bryanthus, grass, sedge, saxifrage form beautiful fringes. Who could imagine
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty so fine in so savage a place? Gardens are blooming in all sorts of nooks
    </p>
    <p>
     and hollows,—at the head alpine eriogonums, erigerons, saxifrages, gentians,
    </p>
    <p>
     cowania, bush primula; in the middle region larkspur, columbine, orthocarpus,
    </p>
    <p>
     castilleia, harebell, epilobium, violets, mints, yarrow; near the foot sunflowers,
    </p>
    <p>
     lilies, brier rose, iris, lonicera, clematis.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the smallest of the cascades, which I name the Bower Cascade, is in the
    </p>
    <p>
     lower region of the pass, where the vegetation is snowy and luxuriant. Wild
    </p>
    <p>
     rose and dogwood form dense masses overarching the stream, and out of this
    </p>
    <p>
     bower the creek, grown strong with many indashing tributaries, leaps forth into
    </p>
    <p>
     the light, and descends in a fluted curve thick-sown with crisp flashing spray.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the foot of the cañon there is a lake formed in part at least by the damming
    </p>
    <p>
     of the stream by a terminal moraine. The three other lakes in the cañon are in
    </p>
    <p>
     basins eroded from the solid rock, where the pressure of the glacier was
    </p>
    <p>
     greatest, and the most resisting portions of the basin rims are beautifully,
    </p>
    <p>
     tellingly polished. Below Moraine Lake at the foot of the cañon there are several
    </p>
    <p>
     old lake-basins lying between the large lateral moraines which extend out into
    </p>
    <p>
     the desert. These basins are now completely filled up by the material carried in
    </p>
    <p>
     by the streams, and changed to dry sandy flats covered mostly by grass and
    </p>
    <p>
     artemisia and sun-loving flowers. All these lower lake-basins were evidently
    </p>
    <p>
     formed by terminal moraine dams deposited where the receding glacier had
    </p>
    <p>
     lingered during short periods of less waste, or greater snowfall, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking up the cañon from the warm sunny edge of the Mono plain my
    </p>
    <p>
     morning ramble seems a dream, so great is the change in the vegetation and
    </p>
    <p>
     climate. The lilies on the bank of Moraine Lake are higher than my head, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the sunshine is hot enough for palms. Yet the snow round the arctic gardens at
    </p>
    <p>
     the summit of the pass is plainly visible, only about four miles away, and
    </p>
    <p>
     between lie specimen zones of all the principal climates of the globe. In little
    </p>
    <p>
     more than an hour one may swoop down from winter to summer, from an
    </p>
    <p>
     Arctic to a torrid region, through as great changes of climate as one would
    </p>
    <p>
     encounter in traveling from Labrador to Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Indians I had met near the head of the cañon had camped at the foot of it
    </p>
    <p>
     the night before they made the ascent, and I found their fire still smoking on
    </p>
    <p>
     the side of a small tributary stream near Moraine Lake; and on the edge of
    </p>
    <p>
     what is called the Mono Desert, four or five miles from the lake, I came to a
    </p>
    <p>
     patch of elymus, or wild rye, growing in magnificent waving clumps six or eight
    </p>
    <p>
     feet high, bearing heads six to eight inches long. The crop was ripe, and Indian
    </p>
    <p>
     women were gathering the grain in baskets by bending down large handfuls,
    </p>
    <p>
     beating out the seed, and fanning it in the wind. The grains are about five
    </p>
    <p>
     eighths of an inch long, dark-colored and sweet. I fancy the bread made from it
    </p>
    <p>
     must be as good as wheat bread. A fine squirrelish employment this wild grain
    </p>
    <p>
     gathering seems, and the women were evidently enjoying it, laughing and
    </p>
    <p>
     chattering and looking almost natural, though most Indians I have seen are not
    </p>
    <p>
     a whit more natural in their lives than we civilized whites. Perhaps if I knew
    </p>
    <p>
     them better I should like them better. The worst thing about them is their
    </p>
    <p>
     uncleanliness. Nothing truly wild is unclean. Down on the shore of Mono Lake I
    </p>
    <p>
     saw a number of their flimsy huts on the banks of streams that dash swiftly
    </p>
    <p>
     into that dead sea,—mere brush tents where they lie and eat at their ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the men were feasting on buffalo berries, lying beneath the tall bushes
    </p>
    <p>
     now red with fruit. The berries are rather insipid, but they must needs be
    </p>
    <p>
     wholesome, since for days and weeks the In dians, it is said, eat nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the season they in like manner depend chiefly on the fat larvæ of a fly that
    </p>
    <p>
     breeds in the salt water of the lake, or on the big fat corrugated caterpillars of a
    </p>
    <p>
     species of silkworm that feeds on the leaves of the yellow pine. Occasionally a
    </p>
    <p>
     grand rabbit-drive is organized and hundreds are slain with clubs on the lake
    </p>
    <p>
     shore, chased and frightened into a dense crowd by dogs, boys, girls, men and
    </p>
    <p>
     women, and rings of sage brush fire, when of course they are quickly killed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The skins are made into blankets. In the autumn the more enterprising of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hunters bring in a good many deer, and rarely a wild sheep from the high
    </p>
    <p>
     peaks. Antelopes used to be abundant on the desert at the base of the interior
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain-ranges. Sage hens, grouse, and squirrels help to vary their wild diet
    </p>
    <p>
     of worms; pine nuts also from the small interesting Pinus monophylla, and
    </p>
    <p>
     good bread and good mush are made from acorns and wild rye. Strange to say,
    </p>
    <p>
     they seem to like the lake larvæ best of all. Long windrows are washed up on
    </p>
    <p>
     the shore, which they gather and dry like grain for winter use. It is said that
    </p>
    <p>
     wars, on account of encroachments on each other's worm-grounds, are of
    </p>
    <p>
     common occurrence among the various tribes and families. Each claims a
    </p>
    <p>
     certain marked portion of the shore. The pine nuts are delicious—large
    </p>
    <p>
     quantities are gathered every autumn. The tribes of the west flank of the range
    </p>
    <p>
     trade acorns for worms and pine nuts. The squaws carry immense loads on
    </p>
    <p>
     their backs across the rough passes and down the range, making journeys of
    </p>
    <p>
     about forty or fifty miles each way.
    </p>
    <p>
     The desert around the lake is surprisingly flowery. In many places among the
    </p>
    <p>
     sage bushes I saw mentzelia, abronia, aster, bigelovia, and gilia, all of which
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to enjoy the hot sunshine. The abronia, in particular, is a delicate,
    </p>
    <p>
     fragrant, and most charming plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     MONO LAKE AND VOLCANIC CONES, LOOKING SOUTH
    </p>
    <p>
     HIGHEST MONO VOLCANIC CONES NEAR VIEW
    </p>
    <p>
     Opposite the mouth of the cañon a range of volcanic cones extends southward
    </p>
    <p>
     from the lake, rising abruptly out of the desert like a chain of mountains. The
    </p>
    <p>
     largest of the cones are about twenty-five hundred feet high above the lake
    </p>
    <p>
     level, have well-formed craters, and all of them are evidently comparatively
    </p>
    <p>
     recent additions to the landscape. At a distance of a few miles they look like
    </p>
    <p>
     heaps of loose ashes that have never been blest by either rain or snow, but, for
    </p>
    <p>
     a' that and a' that, yellow pines are climbing their gray slopes, trying to clothe
    </p>
    <p>
     them and give beauty for ashes. A country of wonderful contrasts. Hot deserts
    </p>
    <p>
     bounded by snow-laden mountains,—cinders and ashes scattered on glacierpolished pavements, —frost and fire working together in the making of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the lake are several volcanic islands, which show that the waters were once
    </p>
    <p>
     mingled with fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glad to get back to the green side of the mountains, though I have greatly
    </p>
    <p>
     enjoyed the gray east side and hope to see more of it. Reading these grand
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain manuscripts displayed through every vicissitude of heat and cold,
    </p>
    <p>
     calm and storm, upheaving volcanoes and down-grinding glaciers, we see that
    </p>
    <p>
     everything in Nature called destruction must be creation—a change from
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty to beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our glacier meadow camp north of the Soda Springs seems more beautiful
    </p>
    <p>
     every day. The grass covers all the ground though the leaves are thread-like in
    </p>
    <p>
     fineness, and in walking on the sod it seems like a plush carpet of marvelous
    </p>
    <p>
     richness and softness, and the purple panicles brushing against one's feet are
    </p>
    <p>
     not felt. This is a typical glacier meadow, occupying the basin of a vanished
    </p>
    <p>
     lake, very definitely bounded by walls of the arrowy two-leaved pines drawn up
    </p>
    <p>
     in a handsome orderly array like soldiers on parade. There are many other
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows of the same kind hereabouts imbedded in the woods. The main big
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows along the river are the same in general and extend with but little
    </p>
    <p>
     interruption for ten or twelve miles, but none I have seen are so finely finished
    </p>
    <p>
     and perfect as this one. It is richer in flowering plants than the prairies of
    </p>
    <p>
     Wisconsin and Illinois were when in all their wild glory. The showy flowers are
    </p>
    <p>
     mostly three species of gentian, a purple and yellow orthocarpus, a golden-rod
    </p>
    <p>
     or two, a small blue pentstemon almost like a gentian, potentilla, ivesia,
    </p>
    <p>
     pedicularis, white violet, kalmia, and bryanthus. There are no coarse weedy
    </p>
    <p>
     plants. Through this flowery lawn flows a stream silently gliding, swirling,
    </p>
    <p>
     slipping as if careful not to make the slightest noise. It is only about three feet
    </p>
    <p>
     wide in most places, widening here and there into pools six or eight feet in
    </p>
    <p>
     diameter with no apparent current, the banks bossily rounded by the downcurving mossy sod, grass panicles over-leaning like miniature pine trees, and
    </p>
    <p>
     rugs of bryanthus spreading here and there over sunken boulders. At the foot
    </p>
    <p>
     of the meadow the stream, rich with the juices of the plants it has refreshed,
    </p>
    <p>
     sings merrily down over shelving rock ledges on its way to the Tuolumne River.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sublime, massive Mount Dana and its companions, green, red, and white,
    </p>
    <p>
     loom impressively above the pines along the eastern horizon; a range or spur of
    </p>
    <p>
     gray rugged granite crags and mountains on the north; the curiously crested
    </p>
    <p>
     and battlemented Mount Hoffman on the west; and the Cathedral Range on
    </p>
    <p>
     the south with its grand Cathedral Peak, Cathedral Spires, Unicorn Peak, and
    </p>
    <p>
     several others, gray and pointed or massively rounded.

    <p>
     THE TUOLUMNE CAMP
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Clouds none, cool west wind, slight hoarfrost on the meadows. Carlo
    </p>
    <p>
     is missing; have been seeking him all day. In the thick woods between camp
    </p>
    <p>
     and the river, among tall grass and fallen pines, I discovered a baby fawn. At
    </p>
    <p>
     first it seemed inclined to come to me; but when I tried to catch it, and got
    </p>
    <p>
     within a rod or two, it turned and walked softly away, choosing its steps like a
    </p>
    <p>
     cautious, stealthy, hunting cat. Then, as if suddenly called or alarmed, it began
    </p>
    <p>
     to buck and run like a grown deer, jumping high above the fallen trunks, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was soon out of sight. Possibly its mother may have called it, but I did not hear
    </p>
    <p>
     her. I don't think fawns ever leave the home thicket or follow their mothers
    </p>
    <p>
     until they are called or frightened. I am distressed about Carlo. There are
    </p>
    <p>
     several other camps and dogs not many miles from here, and I still hope to find
    </p>
    <p>
     him. He never left me before. Panthers are very rare here, and I don't think any
    </p>
    <p>
     of these cats would dare touch him. He knows bears too well to be caught by
    </p>
    <p>
     them, and as for Indians, they don't want him.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Cool, bright day, hinting Indian summer. Mr. Delaney has gone to the
    </p>
    <p>
     Smith Ranch, on the Tuolumne below Hetch-Hetchy Valley, thirty-five or forty
    </p>
    <p>
     miles from here, so I'll be alone for a week or more,—not really alone, for Carlo
    </p>
    <p>
     has come back. He was at a camp a few miles to the northwestward. He looked
    </p>
    <p>
     sheepish and ashamed when I asked him where he had been and why he had
    </p>
    <p>
     gone away without leave. He is now trying to get me to caress him and show
    </p>
    <p>
     signs of forgiveness. A wondrous wise dog. A great load is off my mind. I could
    </p>
    <p>
     not have left the mountains without him. He seems very glad to get back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rose and crimson sunset, and soon after the stars appeared the moon rose in
    </p>
    <p>
     most impressive majesty over the top of Mount Dana. I sauntered up the
    </p>
    <p>
     meadow in the white light. The jet-black tree-shadows were so wonderfully
    </p>
    <p>
     distinct and substantial looking, I often stepped high in crossing them, taking
    </p>
    <p>
     them for black charred logs.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Another charming day, warm and calm soon after sunrise, clouds only
    </p>
    <p>
     about .,—faint, silky cirrus wisps, scarcely visible. Slight frost, Indian
    </p>
    <p>
     summerish, the mountains growing softer in outline and dreamy looking, their
    </p>
    <p>
     rough angles melted off, apparently. Sky at evening with fine, dark, subdued
    </p>
    <p>
     purple, al most like the evening purple of the San Joaquin plains in settled
    </p>
    <p>
     weather. The moon is now gazing over the summit of Dana. Glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     exhilarating air. I wonder if in all the world there is another mountain range of
    </p>
    <p>
     equal height blessed with weather so fine, and so openly kind and hospitable
    </p>
    <p>
     and approachable.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Cool as usual in the morning, quickly changing to the ordinary serene
    </p>
    <p>
     generous warmth and brightness. Toward evening the west wind was cool and
    </p>
    <p>
     sent us to the camp-fire. Of all Nature's flowery carpeted mountain halls none
    </p>
    <p>
     can be finer than this glacier meadow. Bees and butterflies seem as abundant
    </p>
    <p>
     as ever. The birds are still here, showing no sign of leaving for winter quarters
    </p>
    <p>
     though the frost must bring them to mind. For my part I should like to stay
    </p>
    <p>
     here all winter or all my life or even all eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Frost this morning; all the meadow grass and some of the pine
    </p>
    <p>
     needles sparkling with irised crystals,—flowers of light. Large picturesque
    </p>
    <p>
     clouds, craggy like rocks, are piled on Mount Dana, reddish in color like the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain itself; the sky for a few degrees around the horizon is pale purple,
    </p>
    <p>
     into which the pines dip their spires with fine effect. Spent the day as usual
    </p>
    <p>
     looking about me, watching the changing lights, the ripening autumn colors of
    </p>
    <p>
     the grass, seeds, late-blooming gentians, asters, goldenrods; parting the
    </p>
    <p>
     meadow grass here and there and looking down into the underworld of mosses
    </p>
    <p>
     and liverworts; watching the busy ants and beetles and other small people at
    </p>
    <p>
     work and play like squirrels and bears in a forest; studying the formation of
    </p>
    <p>
     lakes and meadows, moraines, mountain sculpture; making small beginnings
    </p>
    <p>
     in these directions, charmed by the serene beauty of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     The day has been extra cloudy, though bright on the whole, for the clouds were
    </p>
    <p>
     brighter than common. Clouds about ., which in Switzerland would be
    </p>
    <p>
     considered extra clear. Probably more free sunshine falls on this majestic range
    </p>
    <p>
     than on any other in the world I've ever seen or heard of. It has the brightest
    </p>
    <p>
     weather, brightest glacier-polished rocks, the greatest abundance of irised
    </p>
    <p>
     spray from its glorious waterfalls, the brightest forests of silver firs and silver
    </p>
    <p>
     pines, more star-shine, moonshine, and perhaps more crystal-shine than any
    </p>
    <p>
     other mountain chain, and its countless mirror lakes, having more light poured
    </p>
    <p>
     into them, glow and spangle most. And how glorious the shining after the short
    </p>
    <p>
     summer showers and after frosty nights when the morning sunbeams are
    </p>
    <p>
     pouring through the crystals on the grass and pine needles, and how ineffa bly
    </p>
    <p>
     spiritually fine is the morning-glow on the mountain-tops and the alpenglow of
    </p>
    <p>
     evening. Well may the Sierra be named, not the Snowy Range, but the Range of
    </p>
    <p>
     Light.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Clouds only .,—mostly white and pink cumuli over the Hoffman spur
    </p>
    <p>
     towards evening,—frosty morning. Crystals grow in marvelous beauty and
    </p>
    <p>
     perfection of form these still nights, every one built as carefully as the grandest
    </p>
    <p>
     holiest temple, as if planned to endure forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Contemplating the lace-like fabric of streams outspread over the mountains, we
    </p>
    <p>
     are reminded that everything is flowing—going somewhere, animals and socalled lifeless rocks as well as water. Thus the snow flows fast or slow in grand
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty-making glaciers and avalanches; the air in majestic floods carrying
    </p>
    <p>
     minerals, plant leaves, seeds, spores, with streams of music and fragrance;
    </p>
    <p>
     water streams carrying rocks both in solution and in the form of mud particles,
    </p>
    <p>
     sand, pebbles, and boulders. Rocks flow from volcanoes like water from
    </p>
    <p>
     springs, and animals flock together and flow in currents modified by stepping,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaping, gliding, flying, swimming, etc. While the stars go streaming through
    </p>
    <p>
     space pulsed on and on forever like blood globules in Nature's warm heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . The dawn a glorious song of color. Sky absolutely cloudless. A fine
    </p>
    <p>
     crop hoarfrost. Warm after ten o'clock. The gentians don't mind the first frost
    </p>
    <p>
     though their petals seem so delicate; they close every night as if going to sleep,
    </p>
    <p>
     and awake fresh as ever in the morning sun-glory. The grass is a shade
    </p>
    <p>
     browner since last week, but there are no nipped wilted plants of any sort as
    </p>
    <p>
     far as I have seen. Butterflies and the grand host of smaller flies are benumbed
    </p>
    <p>
     every night, but they hover and dance in the sunbeams over the meadows
    </p>
    <p>
     before noon with no apparent lack of playful, joyful life. Soon they must all fall
    </p>
    <p>
     like petals in an orchard, dry and wrinkled, not a wing of all the mighty host
    </p>
    <p>
     left to tingle the air. Nevertheless new myriads will arise in the spring, rejoicing,
    </p>
    <p>
     exulting, as if laughing cold death to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Clouds about ., slight frost. Bland serene Indian summer weather.
    </p>
    <p>
     Have been gazing all day at the mountains, watching the changing lights. More
    </p>
    <p>
     and more plainly are they clothed with light as a garment, white tinged with
    </p>
    <p>
     pale purple, palest during the midday hours, richest in the morning and
    </p>
    <p>
     evening. Everything seems consciously peaceful, thoughtful, faithfully waiting
    </p>
    <p>
     God's will.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . This day just like yesterday. A few clouds motionless and apparently
    </p>
    <p>
     with no work to do beyond looking beautiful. Frost enough for crystal
    </p>
    <p>
     building,—glorious fields of ice-diamonds destined to last but a night. How
    </p>
    <p>
     lavish is Nature building, pulling down, creating, destroying, chasing every
    </p>
    <p>
     material particle from form to form, ever changing, ever beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Delaney arrived this morning. Felt not a trace of loneliness while he was
    </p>
    <p>
     gone. On the contrary, I never enjoyed grander company. The whole wilderness
    </p>
    <p>
     seems to be alive and familiar, full of humanity. The very stones seem talkative,
    </p>
    <p>
     sympathetic, brotherly. No wonder when we consider that we all have the same
    </p>
    <p>
     Father and Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     August . Clouds .. Silky cirrus wisps and fringes so fine they almost escape
    </p>
    <p>
     notice. Frost enough for another crop of crystals on the meadows but none on
    </p>
    <p>
     the forests. The gentians, goldenrods, asters, etc., don't seem to feel it; neither
    </p>
    <p>
     petals nor leaves are touched though they seem so tender. Every day opens
    </p>
    <p>
     and closes like a flower, noiseless, effortless. Divine peace glows on all the
    </p>
    <p>
     majestic landscape like the silent enthusiastic joy that sometimes transfigures
    </p>
    <p>
     a noble human face.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Clouds .—motionless, of no particular color—ornaments with no
    </p>
    <p>
     hint of rain or snow in them. Day all calm—an other grand throb of Nature's
    </p>
    <p>
     heart, ripening late flowers and seeds for next summer, full of life and the
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughts and plans of life to come, and full of ripe and ready death beautiful as
    </p>
    <p>
     life, telling divine wisdom and goodness and immortality. Have been up Mount
    </p>
    <p>
     Dana, making haste to see as much as I can now that the time of departure is
    </p>
    <p>
     drawing nigh. The views from the summit reach far and wide, eastward over
    </p>
    <p>
     the Mono Lake and Desert; mountains beyond mountains looking strangely
    </p>
    <p>
     barren and gray and bare like heaps of ashes dumped from the sky. The lake,
    </p>
    <p>
     eight or ten miles in diameter, shines like a burnished disk of silver, no trees
    </p>
    <p>
     about its gray, ashy, cindery shores. Looking westward, the glorious forests are
    </p>
    <p>
     seen sweeping over countless ridges and hills, girdling domes and subordinate
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains, fringing in long curving lines the dividing ridges, and filling every
    </p>
    <p>
     hollow where the glaciers have spread soil-beds however rocky or smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking northward and southward along the axis of the range, you see the
    </p>
    <p>
     glorious array of high mountains, crags and peaks and snow, the fountainheads of rivers that are flowing west to the sea through the famous Golden
    </p>
    <p>
     Gate, and east to hot salt lakes and deserts to evaporate and hurry back into
    </p>
    <p>
     the sky. Innumerable lakes are shining like eyes beneath heavy rock brows,
    </p>
    <p>
     bare or tree fringed, or imbedded in black forests. Meadow openings in the
    </p>
    <p>
     woods seem as numerous as the lakes or perhaps more so. Far up the
    </p>
    <p>
     moraine-covered slopes and among crumbling rocks I found many delicate
    </p>
    <p>
     hardy plants, some of them still in flower. The best gains of this trip were the
    </p>
    <p>
     lessons of unity and interrelation of all the features of the landscape revealed
    </p>
    <p>
     in general views. The lakes and meadows are located just where the ancient
    </p>
    <p>
     glaciers bore heaviest at the foot of the steepest parts of their channels, and of
    </p>
    <p>
     course their longest diameters are approximately parallel with each other and
    </p>
    <p>
     with the belts of forests growing in long curving lines on the lateral and medial
    </p>
    <p>
     moraines, and in broad outspreading fields on the terminal beds deposited
    </p>
    <p>
     toward the end of the ice period when the glaciers were receding. The domes,
    </p>
    <p>
     ridges, and spurs also show the influence of glacial action in their forms, which
    </p>
    <p>
     approximately seem to be the forms of greatest strength with reference to the
    </p>
    <p>
     stress of oversweeping, past-sweeping, down-grinding ice-streams; survivals of
    </p>
    <p>
     the most resisting masses, or those most favorably situated. How interesting
    </p>
    <p>
     everything is! Every rock, mountain, stream, plant, lake, lawn, forest, garden,
    </p>
    <p>
     bird, beast, insect seems to call and invite us to come and learn something of
    </p>
    <p>
     its history and relationship. But shall the poor ignorant scholar be allowed to
    </p>
    <p>
     try the lessons they offer? It seems too great and good to be true. Soon I'll be
    </p>
    <p>
     going to the lowlands. The bread camp must soon be removed. If I had a few
    </p>
    <p>
     sacks of flour, an axe, and some matches, I would build a cabin of pine logs,
    </p>
    <p>
     pile up plenty of firewood about it and stay all winter to see the grand fertile
    </p>
    <p>
     snow-storms, watch the birds and animals that winter thus high, how they
    </p>
    <p>
     live, how the forests look snow-laden or buried, and how the avalanches look
    </p>
    <p>
     and sound on their way down the mountains. But now I'll have to go, for there
    </p>
    <p>
     is nothing to spare in the way of provisions. I'll surely be back, however, surely
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll be back. No other place has ever so overwhelmingly attracted me as this
    </p>
    <p>
     hospitable, Godful wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
     ONE OF THE HIGHEST MOUNT RITTER FOUNTAINS
    </p>
    <p>
     September . A grand, red, rosy, crimson day,—a perfect glory of a day. What it
    </p>
    <p>
     means I don't know. It is the first marked change from tranquil sunshine with
    </p>
    <p>
     purple mornings and evenings and still, white noons. There is nothing like a
    </p>
    <p>
     storm, however. The average cloudiness only about ., and there is no sighing in
    </p>
    <p>
     the woods to betoken a big weather change. The sky was red in the morning
    </p>
    <p>
     and evening, the color not diffused like the ordinary purple glow, but loaded
    </p>
    <p>
     upon separate well-defined clouds that remained motionless, as if anchored
    </p>
    <p>
     around the jagged mountain-fenced horizon. A deep-red cap, bluffy around its
    </p>
    <p>
     sides, lingered a long time on Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, drooping so low
    </p>
    <p>
     as to hide most of their bases, but leaving Dana's round summit free, which
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to float separate and alone over the big crimson cloud. Mammoth
    </p>
    <p>
     Mountain, to the south of Gibbs and Bloody Cañon, striped and spotted with
    </p>
    <p>
     snow-banks and clumps of dwarf pine, was also favored with a glorious
    </p>
    <p>
     crimson cap, in the making of which there was no trace of economy—a huge
    </p>
    <p>
     bossy pile colored with a perfect passion of crimson that seemed important
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to be sent off to burn among the stars in majestic independence. One is
    </p>
    <p>
     constantly reminded of the infinite lavishness and fertility of Nature—
    </p>
    <p>
     inexhaustible abundance amid what seems enormous waste. And yet when we
    </p>
    <p>
     look into any of her operations that lie within reach of our minds, we learn that
    </p>
    <p>
     no particle of her material is wasted or worn out. It is eternally flowing from
    </p>
    <p>
     use to use, beauty to yet higher beauty; and we soon cease to lament waste
    </p>
    <p>
     and death, and rather rejoice and exult in the imperishable, unspendable
    </p>
    <p>
     wealth of the universe, and faithfully watch and wait the reappearance of
    </p>
    <p>
     everything that melts and fades and dies about us, feeling sure that its next
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance will be better and more beautiful than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
     I watched the growth of these red-lands of the sky as eagerly as if new
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain ranges were being built. Soon the group of snowy peaks in whose
    </p>
    <p>
     recesses lie the highest fountains of the Tuolumne, Merced, and North Fork of
    </p>
    <p>
     the San Joaquin were decorated with majestic colored clouds like those already
    </p>
    <p>
     described, but more complicated, to correspond with the grand fountain-heads
    </p>
    <p>
     of the rivers they overshadowed. The Sierra Cathedral, to the south of camp,
    </p>
    <p>
     was overshadowed like Sinai. Never before noticed so fine a union of rock and
    </p>
    <p>
     cloud in form and color and substance, drawing earth and sky together as one;
    </p>
    <p>
     and so human is it, every feature and tint of color goes to one's heart, and we
    </p>
    <p>
     shout, exulting in wild enthusiasm as if all the divine show were our own. More
    </p>
    <p>
     and more, in a place like this, we feel ourselves part of wild Nature, kin to
    </p>
    <p>
     everything. Spent most of the day high up on the north rim of the valley,
    </p>
    <p>
     commanding views of the clouds in all their red glory spreading their wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     light over all the basin, while the rocks and trees and small Alpine plants at
    </p>
    <p>
     my feet seemed hushed and thoughtful, as if they also were conscious
    </p>
    <p>
     spectators of the glorious new cloud-world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here and there, as I plodded farther and higher, I came to small gardenpatches and ferneries just where one would naturally decide that no plantcreature could possibly live. But, as in the region about the head of Mono Pass
    </p>
    <p>
     and the top of Dana, it was in the wildest, highest places that the most
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful and tender and enthusiastic plant-people were found. Again and
    </p>
    <p>
     again, as I lingered over these charming plants, I said, How came you here?
    </p>
    <p>
     How do you live through the winter? Our roots, they explained, reach far down
    </p>
    <p>
     the joints of the summer-warmed rocks, and beneath our fine snow mantle
    </p>
    <p>
     killing frosts cannot reach us, while we sleep away the dark half of the year
    </p>
    <p>
     dreaming of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ever since I was allowed entrance into these mountains I have been looking for
    </p>
    <p>
     cassiope, said to be the most beautiful and best loved of the heathworts, but,
    </p>
    <p>
     strange to say, I have not yet found it. On my high mountain walks I keep
    </p>
    <p>
     muttering, "Cassiope, cassiope." This name, as Calvinists say, is driven in upon
    </p>
    <p>
     me, notwithstanding the glorious host of plants that come about me uncalled
    </p>
    <p>
     as soon as I show myself. Cassiope seems the highest name of all the small
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain-heath people, and as if conscious of her worth, keeps out of my way.
    </p>
    <p>
     I must find her soon, if at all this year.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . All the vast sky dome is clear, filled only with mellow Indian
    </p>
    <p>
     summer light. The pine and hemlock and fir cones are nearly ripe and are
    </p>
    <p>
     falling fast from morning to night, cut off and gathered by the busy squirrels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost all the plants have matured their seeds, their summer work done; and
    </p>
    <p>
     the summer crop of birds and deer will soon be able to follow their parents to
    </p>
    <p>
     the foothills and plains at the approach of winter, when the snow begins to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . No clouds. Weather cool, calm, bright as if no great thing was yet
    </p>
    <p>
     ready to be done. Have been sketching the North Tuolumne Church. The
    </p>
    <p>
     sunset gloriously colored.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Still another perfectly cloudless day, purple evening and morning,
    </p>
    <p>
     all the middle hours one mass of pure serene sunshine. Soon after sunrise the
    </p>
    <p>
     air grew warm, and there was no wind. One naturally halted to see what
    </p>
    <p>
     Nature intended to do. There is a suggestion of real Indian summer in the
    </p>
    <p>
     hushed brooding, faintly hazy weather. The yellow atmosphere, though thin, is
    </p>
    <p>
     still plainly of the same general character as that of eastern Indian summer.
    </p>
    <p>
     The peculiar mellowness is perhaps in part caused by myriads of ripe spores
    </p>
    <p>
     adrift in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Delaney now keeps up a solemn talk about the need of getting away from
    </p>
    <p>
     these high mountains, telling sad stories of flocks that perished in storms that
    </p>
    <p>
     broke suddenly into the midst of fine innocent weather like this we are now
    </p>
    <p>
     enjoying. "In no case," said he, "will I venture to stay so high and far back in
    </p>
    <p>
     the mountains as we now are later than the middle of this month, no matter
    </p>
    <p>
     how warm and sunny it may be." He would move the flock slowly at first, a few
    </p>
    <p>
     miles a day until the Yosemite Creek basin was reached and crossed, then
    </p>
    <p>
     while lingering in the heavy pine woods should the weather threaten he could
    </p>
    <p>
     hurry down to the foothills, where the snow never falls deep enough to smother
    </p>
    <p>
     a sheep. Of course I am anxious to see as much of the wilderness as possible in
    </p>
    <p>
     the few days left me, and I say again,—May the good time come when I can stay
    </p>
    <p>
     as long as I like with plenty of bread, far and free from trampling flocks, though
    </p>
    <p>
     I may well be thankful for this generous foodful inspiring summer. Anyhow we
    </p>
    <p>
     never know where we must go nor what guides we are to get,—men, storms,
    </p>
    <p>
     guardian angels, or sheep. Perhaps almost everybody in the least natural is
    </p>
    <p>
     guarded more than he is ever aware of. All the wilderness seems to be full of
    </p>
    <p>
     tricks and plans to drive and draw us up into God's Light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Have been busy planning, and baking bread for at least one more good wild
    </p>
    <p>
     excursion among the high peaks, and surely none, however hopefully aiming at
    </p>
    <p>
     fortune or fame, ever felt so gloriously happily excited by the outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Left camp at daybreak and made direct for Cathedral Peak,
    </p>
    <p>
     intending to strike eastward and southward from that point among the peaks
    </p>
    <p>
     and ridges at the heads of the Tuolumne, Merced, and San Joaquin Rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Down through the pine woods I made my way, across the Tuolumne River and
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows, and up the heavily timbered slope forming the south boundary of the
    </p>
    <p>
     upper Tuolumne basin, along the east side of Cathedral Peak, and up to its
    </p>
    <p>
     topmost spire, which I reached at noon, having loitered by the way to study the
    </p>
    <p>
     fine trees—two-leaved pine, mountain pine, albicaulis pine, silver fir, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     most charming, most graceful of all the evergreens, the mountain hemlock.
    </p>
    <p>
     High, cool, late-flowering meadows also detained me, and lakelets and
    </p>
    <p>
     avalanche tracks and huge quarries of moraine rocks above the forests.
    </p>
    <p>
     GLACIER MEADOW STREWN WITH MORAINE BOULDERS , FEET ABOVE
    </p>
    <p>
     THE SEA NEAR MOUNT DANA
    </p>
    <p>
     FRONT OF CATHEDRAL PEAK
    </p>
    <p>
     All the way up from the Big Meadows to the base of the Cathedral the ground is
    </p>
    <p>
     covered with moraine material, the left lateral moraine of the great glacier that
    </p>
    <p>
     must have completely filled this upper Tuolumne basin. Higher there are
    </p>
    <p>
     several small terminal moraines of residual glaciers shoved forward at right
    </p>
    <p>
     angles against the grand simple lateral of the main Tuolumne Glacier. A fine
    </p>
    <p>
     place to study mountain sculpture and soil making. The view from the
    </p>
    <p>
     Cathedral Spires is very fine and telling in every direction. Innumerable peaks,
    </p>
    <p>
     ridges, domes, meadows, lakes, and woods; the forests extending in long
    </p>
    <p>
     curving lines and broad fields wherever the glaciers have left soil for them to
    </p>
    <p>
     grow on, while the sides of the highest mountains show a straggling dwarf
    </p>
    <p>
     growth clinging to rifts in the rocks apparently independent of soil. The dark
    </p>
    <p>
     heath-like growth on the Cathedral roof I found to be dwarf snow-pressed
    </p>
    <p>
     albicaulis pine, about three or four feet high, but very old looking. Many of
    </p>
    <p>
     them are bearing cones, and the noisy Clarke crow is eating the seeds, using
    </p>
    <p>
     his long bill like a woodpecker in digging them out of the cones. A good many
    </p>
    <p>
     flowers are still in bloom about the base of the peak, and even on the roof
    </p>
    <p>
     among the little pines, especially a woody yellow-flowered eri ogonum and a
    </p>
    <p>
     handsome aster. The body of the Cathedral is nearly square, and the roof
    </p>
    <p>
     slopes are wonderfully regular and symmetrical, the ridge trending northeast
    </p>
    <p>
     and southwest. This direction has apparently been determined by structure
    </p>
    <p>
     joints in the granite. The gable on the northeast end is magnificent in size and
    </p>
    <p>
     simplicity, and at its base there is a big snow-bank protected by the shadow of
    </p>
    <p>
     the building. The front is adorned with many pinnacles and a tall spire of
    </p>
    <p>
     curious workmanship. Here too the joints in the rock are seen to have played
    </p>
    <p>
     an important part in determining their forms and size and general
    </p>
    <p>
     arrangement. The Cathedral is said to be about eleven thousand feet above the
    </p>
    <p>
     sea, but the height of the building itself above the level of the ridge it stands on
    </p>
    <p>
     is about fifteen hundred feet. A mile or so to the westward there is a handsome
    </p>
    <p>
     lake, and the glacier-polished granite about it is shining so brightly it is not
    </p>
    <p>
     easy in some places to trace the line between the rock and water, both shining
    </p>
    <p>
     alike. Of this lake with its silvery basin and bits of meadow and groves I have a
    </p>
    <p>
     fine view from the spires; also of Lake Tenaya, Cloud's Rest and the South
    </p>
    <p>
     Dome of Yosemite, Mount Starr King, Mount Hoffman, the Merced peaks, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the vast multitude of snowy fountain peaks extending far north and south
    </p>
    <p>
     along the axis of the range. No feature, however, of all the noble landscape as
    </p>
    <p>
     seen from here seems more wonderful than the Cathedral itself, a temple
    </p>
    <p>
     displaying Nature's best masonry and sermons in stones. How often I have
    </p>
    <p>
     gazed at it from the tops of hills and ridges, and through openings in the
    </p>
    <p>
     forests on my many short excursions, devoutly wondering, admiring, longing!
    </p>
    <p>
     This I may say is the first time I have been at church in California, led here at
    </p>
    <p>
     last, every door graciously opened for the poor lonely worshiper. In our best
    </p>
    <p>
     times everything turns into religion, all the world seems a church and the
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains altars. And lo, here at last in front of the Cathedral is blessed
    </p>
    <p>
     cassiope, ringing her thousands of sweet-toned bells, the sweetest church
    </p>
    <p>
     music I ever enjoyed. Listening, admiring, until late in the afternoon I
    </p>
    <p>
     compelled myself to hasten away eastward back of rough, sharp, spiry,
    </p>
    <p>
     splintery peaks, all of them granite like the Cathedral, sparkling with crystals—
    </p>
    <p>
     feldspar, quartz, hornblende, mica, tourmaline. Had a rather difficult walk and
    </p>
    <p>
     creep across an immense snow and ice cliff which gradually increased in
    </p>
    <p>
     steepness as I advanced until it was almost impassable. Slipped on a
    </p>
    <p>
     dangerous place, but managed to stop by digging my heels into the thawing
    </p>
    <p>
     surface just on the brink of a yawning ice gulf. Camped beside a little pool and
    </p>
    <p>
     a group of crinkled dwarf pines; and as I sit by the fire trying to write notes the
    </p>
    <p>
     shallow pool seems fathomless with the infinite starry heavens in it, while the
    </p>
    <p>
     onlooking rocks and trees, tiny shrubs and daisies and sedges, brought
    </p>
    <p>
     forward in the fire-glow, seem full of thought as if about to speak aloud and tell
    </p>
    <p>
     all their wild stories. A marvelously impressive meeting in which every one has
    </p>
    <p>
     something worth while to tell. And beyond the fire-beams out in the solemn
    </p>
    <p>
     darkness, how impressive is the music of a choir of rills singing their way down
    </p>
    <p>
     from the snow to the river! And when we call to mind that thousands of these
    </p>
    <p>
     rejoicing rills are assembled in each one of the main streams, we wonder the
    </p>
    <p>
     less that our Sierra rivers are songful all the way to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     About sundown saw a flock of dun grayish sparrows going to roost in crevices
    </p>
    <p>
     of a crag above the big snow-field. Charming little mountaineers! Found a
    </p>
    <p>
     species of sedge in flower within eight or ten feet of a snow-bank. Judging by
    </p>
    <p>
     the looks of the ground, it can hardly have been out in the sunshine much
    </p>
    <p>
     longer than a week, and it is likely to be buried again in fresh snow in a month
    </p>
    <p>
     or so, thus making a winter about ten months long, while spring, summer,
    </p>
    <p>
     and autumn are crowded and hurried into two months. How delightful it is to
    </p>
    <p>
     be alone here! How wild everything is—wild as the sky and as pure! Never shall
    </p>
    <p>
     I forget this big, divine day—the Cathedral and its thousands of cassiope bells,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the landscapes around them, and this camp in the gray crags above the
    </p>
    <p>
     woods, with its stars and streams and snow.
    </p>
    <p>
     VIEW OF UPPER TUOLUMNE VALLEY
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Day of climbing, scrambling, sliding on the peaks around the
    </p>
    <p>
     highest source of the Tuolumne and Merced. Climbed three of the most
    </p>
    <p>
     commanding of the mountains, whose names I don't know; crossed streams
    </p>
    <p>
     and huge beds of ice and snow more than I could keep count of. Neither could I
    </p>
    <p>
     keep count of the lakes scattered on tablelands and in the cirques of the peaks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in chains in the cañons, linked together by the streams—a tremendously
    </p>
    <p>
     wild gray wilderness of hacked, shattered crags, ridges, and peaks, a few
    </p>
    <p>
     clouds drifting over and through the midst of them as if looking for work. In
    </p>
    <p>
     general views all the immense round landscape seems raw and lifeless as a
    </p>
    <p>
     quarry, yet the most charming flowers were found rejoicing in countless nooks
    </p>
    <p>
     and garden-like patches everywhere. I must have done three or four days'
    </p>
    <p>
     climbing work in this one. Limbs perfectly tireless until near sundown, when I
    </p>
    <p>
     descended into the main upper Tuolumne valley at the foot of Mount Lyell, the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp still eight or ten miles distant. Going up through the pine woods past the
    </p>
    <p>
     Soda Springs Dome in the dark, where there is much fallen timber, and when
    </p>
    <p>
     all the excitement of seeing things was wanting, I was tired. Arrived at the main
    </p>
    <p>
     camp at nine o'clock, and soon was sleeping sound as death.

     CHAPTER XI

    <p>
     BACK TO THE LOWLANDS
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Weariness rested away and I feel eager and ready for another
    </p>
    <p>
     excursion a month or two long in the same wonderful wilderness. Now,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, I must turn toward the lowlands, praying and hoping Heaven will
    </p>
    <p>
     shove me back again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most telling thing learned in these mountain excursions is the influence of
    </p>
    <p>
     cleavage joints on the features sculptured from the general mass of the range.
    </p>
    <p>
     Evidently the denudation has been enormous, while the inevitable outcome is
    </p>
    <p>
     subtle balanced beauty. Comprehended in general views, the features of the
    </p>
    <p>
     wildest landscape seem to be as harmoniously related as the features of a
    </p>
    <p>
     human face. Indeed, they look human and radiate spiritual beauty, divine
    </p>
    <p>
     thought, however covered and concealed by rock and snow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr. Delaney has hardly had time to ask me how I enjoyed my trip, though he
    </p>
    <p>
     has facilitated and encouraged my plans all summer, and declares I'll be
    </p>
    <p>
     famous some day, a kind guess that seems strange and incredible to a
    </p>
    <p>
     wandering wilderness-lover with never a thought or dream of fame while
    </p>
    <p>
     humbly trying to trace and learn and enjoy Nature's lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
     The camp stuff is now packed on the horses, and the flock is headed for the
    </p>
    <p>
     home ranch. Away we go, down through the pines, leaving the lovely lawn
    </p>
    <p>
     where we have camped so long. I wonder if I'll ever see it again. The sod is so
    </p>
    <p>
     tough and close it is scarcely at all injured by the sheep. Fortunately they are
    </p>
    <p>
     not fond of silky glacier meadow grass. The day is perfectly clear, not a cloud or
    </p>
    <p>
     the faintest hint of a cloud is visible, and there is no wind. I wonder if in all the
    </p>
    <p>
     world, at a height of nine thousand feet, weather so steadily, faithfully calm
    </p>
    <p>
     and bright and hospitable may anywhere else be found. We are going away
    </p>
    <p>
     fearing destructive storms, though it is difficult to conceive weather changes so
    </p>
    <p>
     great.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the water is now low in the river, the usual difficulty occurred in
    </p>
    <p>
     getting the flock across it. Every sheep seemed to be invincibly determined to
    </p>
    <p>
     die any sort of dry death rather than wet its feet. Carlo has learned the sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     business as perfectly as the best shepherd, and it is interesting to watch his
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligent efforts to push or frighten the silly creatures into the water. They
    </p>
    <p>
     had to be fairly crowded and shoved over the bank; and when at last one
    </p>
    <p>
     crossed because it could not push its way back, the whole flock suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     plunged in headlong together, as if the river was the only desirable part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     world. Aside from mere money profit one would rather herd wolves than sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as they clambered up the opposite bank, they began baaing and
    </p>
    <p>
     feeding as if nothing unusual had happened. We crossed the meadows and
    </p>
    <p>
     drove slowly up the south rim of the valley through the same woods I had
    </p>
    <p>
     passed on my way to Cathedral Peak, and camped for the night by the side of a
    </p>
    <p>
     small pond on top of the big lateral moraine.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . In the morning at daybreak not one of the two thousand sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     was in sight. Examining the tracks, we discovered that they had been
    </p>
    <p>
     scattered, perhaps by a bear. In a few hours all were found and gathered into
    </p>
    <p>
     one flock again. Had fine view of a deer. How graceful and perfect in every way
    </p>
    <p>
     it seemed as compared with the silly, dusty, tousled sheep! From the high
    </p>
    <p>
     ground hereabouts had another grand view to the northward—a heaving,
    </p>
    <p>
     swelling sea of domes and round-backed ridges fringed with pines, and
    </p>
    <p>
     bounded by innumerable sharp-pointed peaks, gray and barren-looking,
    </p>
    <p>
     though so full of beautiful life. Another day of the calm, cloudless kind, purple
    </p>
    <p>
     in the morning and evening. The evening glow has been very marked for the
    </p>
    <p>
     last two or three weeks. Perhaps the "zodiacal light."
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Cloudless. Slight frost. Calm. Fairly started downhill, and now are
    </p>
    <p>
     camped at the west end meadows of Lake Tenaya—a charming place. Lake
    </p>
    <p>
     smooth as glass, mirroring its miles of glacier-polished pavements and bold
    </p>
    <p>
     mountain walls. Find aster still in flower. Here is about the upper limit of the
    </p>
    <p>
     dwarf form of the goldcup oak,—eight thousand feet above sea-level,—reaching
    </p>
    <p>
     about two thousand feet higher than the California black oak Quercus
    </p>
    <p>
     Californica. Lovely evening, the lake reflections after dark marvelously
    </p>
    <p>
     impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Cloudless day, all pure sun-gold. Among the magnificent silver firs
    </p>
    <p>
     once more, within two miles of the brink of Yosemite, at the famous Portuguese
    </p>
    <p>
     bear camp. Chaparral of goldcup oak, manzanita, and ceanothus abundant
    </p>
    <p>
     hereabouts, wanting about the Tuolumne meadows, although the elevation is
    </p>
    <p>
     but little higher there. The two-leaved pine, though far more abundant about
    </p>
    <p>
     the Tuolumne meadow region, reaches its greatest size on stream-sides
    </p>
    <p>
     hereabouts and around meadows that are rather boggy. All the best dry ground
    </p>
    <p>
     is taken by the magnificent silver fir, which here reaches its greatest size and
    </p>
    <p>
     forms a well-defined belt. A glorious tree. Have fine bed of its boughs to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Camp this evening at Yosemite Creek, close to the stream, on a
    </p>
    <p>
     little sand flat near our old camp-ground. The vegetation is already brown and
    </p>
    <p>
     yellow and dry; the creek almost dry also. The slender form of the two-leaved
    </p>
    <p>
     pine on its banks is, I think, the handsomest I have anywhere seen. It might
    </p>
    <p>
     easily pass at first sight for a distinct species, though surely only a variety
    </p>
    <p>
     Murrayana, due to crowded and rapid growth on good soil. The yellow pine is
    </p>
    <p>
     as variable, or perhaps more so. The form here and a thousand feet higher, on
    </p>
    <p>
     crumbling rocks, is broad branching, with closely furrowed, reddish bark, large
    </p>
    <p>
     cones, and long leaves. It is one of the hardiest of pines, and has wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     vitality. The tassels of long, stout needles shining silvery in the sun, when the
    </p>
    <p>
     wind is blowing them all in the same direction, is one of the most splendid
    </p>
    <p>
     spectacles these glorious Sierra forests have to show. This variety of Pinus
    </p>
    <p>
     ponderosa is regarded as a distinct species, Pinus Jeffreyi, by some botanists.
    </p>
    <p>
     The basin of this famous Yosemite stream is extremely rocky,—seems fairly to
    </p>
    <p>
     be paved with domes like a street with big cobblestones. I wonder if I shall ever
    </p>
    <p>
     be allowed to explore it. It draws me so strongly, I would make any sacrifice to
    </p>
    <p>
     try to read its lessons. I thank God for this glimpse of it. The charms of these
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains are beyond all common reason, unexplainable and mysterious as
    </p>
    <p>
     life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Nearly all day in magnificent fir forest, the top branches laden with
    </p>
    <p>
     superb erect gray cones shining with beads of pure balsam. The squirrels are
    </p>
    <p>
     cutting them off at a great rate. Bump, bump, I hear them falling, soon to be
    </p>
    <p>
     gathered and stored for winter bread. Those that chance to be left by the
    </p>
    <p>
     industrious harvesters drop the scales and bracts when fully ripe, and it is fine
    </p>
    <p>
     to see the purple-winged seeds flying in swirling, merry-looking flocks seeking
    </p>
    <p>
     their fortunes. The bole and dead limbs of nearly every tree in the main forestbelt are ornamented by conspicuous tufts and strips of a yellow lichen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Camped for the night at Cascade Creek, near the Mono Trail crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Manzanita berries now ripe. Cloudiness to-day about .. The sunset very rich,
    </p>
    <p>
     flaming purple and crimson showing gloriously through the aisles of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . The weather pure gold, cloudiness about ., white cirrus flects and
    </p>
    <p>
     pencilings around the horizon. Move two or three miles and camp at Tamarack
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat. Wandering in the woods here back of the pines which bound the
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows, I found very noble specimens of the magnificent silver fir, the tallest
    </p>
    <p>
     about two hundred and forty feet high and five feet in diameter four feet from
    </p>
    <p>
     the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Crawled slowly four or five miles to-day through the glorious forest
    </p>
    <p>
     to Crane Flat, where we are camped for the night. The forests we so admired in
    </p>
    <p>
     summer seem still more beautiful and sublime in this mellow autumn light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lovely starry night, the tall, spiring tree-tops relieved in jet black against the
    </p>
    <p>
     sky. I linger by the fire, loath to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Left camp early. Ran over the Tuolumne divide and down a few
    </p>
    <p>
     miles to a grove of sequoias that I had heard of, directed by the Don. They
    </p>
    <p>
     occupy an area of perhaps less than a hundred acres. Some of the trees are
    </p>
    <p>
     noble, colossal old giants, surrounded by magnificent sugar pines and Douglas
    </p>
    <p>
     spruces. The perfect specimens not burned or broken are singularly regular
    </p>
    <p>
     and symmetrical, though not at all conventional, showing infinite variety in
    </p>
    <p>
     general unity and harmony; the noble shafts with rich purplish brown fluted
    </p>
    <p>
     bark, free of limbs for one hundred and fifty feet or so, ornamented here and
    </p>
    <p>
     there with leafy rosettes; main branches of the oldest trees very large, crooked
    </p>
    <p>
     and rugged, zigzagging stiffly outward seemingly lawless, yet unexpectedly
    </p>
    <p>
     stooping just at the right distance from the trunk and dissolving in dense
    </p>
    <p>
     bossy masses of branchlets, thus making a regular though greatly varied
    </p>
    <p>
     outline,—a cylinder of leafy, outbulging spray masses, terminating in a noble
    </p>
    <p>
     dome, that may be recognized while yet far off upheaved against the sky above
    </p>
    <p>
     the dark bed of pines and firs and spruces, the king of all conifers, not only in
    </p>
    <p>
     size but in sublime majesty of behavior and port. I found a black, charred
    </p>
    <p>
     stump about thirty feet in diameter and eighty or ninety feet high—a venerable,
    </p>
    <p>
     impressive old monument of a tree that in its prime may have been the
    </p>
    <p>
     monarch of the grove; seedlings and saplings growing up here and there, thrifty
    </p>
    <p>
     and hopeful, giving no hint of the dying out of the species. Not any unfavorable
    </p>
    <p>
     change of climate, but only fire, threatens the existence of these noblest of
    </p>
    <p>
     God's trees. Sorry I was not able to get a count of the old monument's annual
    </p>
    <p>
     rings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Camp this evening at Hazel Green, on the broad back of the dividing ridge near
    </p>
    <p>
     our old camp-ground when we were on the way up the mountains in the
    </p>
    <p>
     spring. This ridge has the finest sugar-pine groves and finest manzanita and
    </p>
    <p>
     ceanothus thickets I have yet found on all this wonderful summer journey.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Made a long descent on the south side of the divide to Brown's
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat, the grand forests now left above us, though the sugar pine still flourishes
    </p>
    <p>
     fairly well, and with the yellow pine, libocedrus, and Douglas spruce, makes
    </p>
    <p>
     forests that would be considered most wonderful in any other part of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Indians here, with great concern, pointed to an old garden patch on the flat
    </p>
    <p>
     and told us to keep away from it. Perhaps some of their tribe are buried here.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . Camped this evening at Smith's Mill, on the first broad mountain
    </p>
    <p>
     bench or plateau reached in ascending the range, where pines grow large
    </p>
    <p>
     enough for good lumber. Here wheat, apples, peaches, and grapes grow, and
    </p>
    <p>
     we were treated to wine and apples. The wine I didn't like, but Mr. Delaney and
    </p>
    <p>
     the Indian driver and the shepherd seemed to think the stuff divine. Compared
    </p>
    <p>
     to sparkling Sierra water fresh from the heavens, it seemed a dull, muddy,
    </p>
    <p>
     stupid drink. But the apples, best of fruits, how delicious they were—fit for
    </p>
    <p>
     gods or men.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the way down from Brown's Flat we stopped at Bower Cave, and I spent an
    </p>
    <p>
     hour in it—one of the most novel and interesting of all Nature's underground
    </p>
    <p>
     mansions. Plenty of sunlight pours into it through the leaves of the four maple
    </p>
    <p>
     trees growing in its mouth, illuminating its clear, calm pool and marble
    </p>
    <p>
     chambers,—a charming place, ravishingly beautiful, but the accessible parts of
    </p>
    <p>
     the walls sadly disfigured with names of vandals.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . The weather still golden and calm, but hot. We are now in the foothills, and all the conifers are left behind, except the gray Sabine pine. Camped
    </p>
    <p>
     at the Dutch Boy's Ranch, where there are extensive barley fields now showing
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing save dusty stubble.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . A terribly hot, dusty, sunburned day, and as nothing was to be
    </p>
    <p>
     gained by loitering where the flock could find nothing to eat save thorny twigs
    </p>
    <p>
     and chaparral, we made a long drive, and before sundown reached the home
    </p>
    <p>
     ranch on the yellow San Joaquin plain.
    </p>
    <p>
     September . The sheep were let out of the corral one by one, this morning, and
    </p>
    <p>
     counted, and strange to say, after all their adventurous wanderings in
    </p>
    <p>
     bewildering rocks and brush and streams, scattered by bears, poisoned by
    </p>
    <p>
     azalea, kalmia, alkali, all are accounted for. Of the two thousand and fifty that
    </p>
    <p>
     left the corral in the spring lean and weak, two thousand and twenty-five have
    </p>
    <p>
     returned fat and strong. The losses are: ten killed by bears, one by a
    </p>
    <p>
     rattlesnake, one that had to be killed after it had broken its leg on a boulder
    </p>
    <p>
     slope, and one that ran away in blind terror on being accidentally separated
    </p>
    <p>
     from the flock,—thirteen all told. Of the other twelve doomed never to return,
    </p>
    <p>
     three were sold to ranchmen and nine were made camp mutton.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here ends my forever memorable first High Sierra excursion. I have crossed the
    </p>
    <p>
     Range of Light, surely the brightest and best of all the Lord has built; and
    </p>
    <p>
     rejoicing in its glory, I gladly, gratefully, hopefully pray I may see it again.
    </p>
    <p>
