    <p>
     THE GREAT FOREST
    </p>
    <p>
     The old men say their fathers told them that soon after the fields were
    </p>
    <p>
     left to themselves a change began to be visible. It became green
    </p>
    <p>
     everywhere in the first spring, after London ended, so that all the
    </p>
    <p>
     country looked alike.
    </p>
    <p>
     The meadows were green, and so was the rising wheat which had been sown,
    </p>
    <p>
     but which neither had nor would receive any further care. Such arable
    </p>
    <p>
     fields as had not been sown, but where the last stubble had been
    </p>
    <p>
     ploughed up, were overrun with couch-grass, and where the short stubble
    </p>
    <p>
     had not been ploughed, the weeds hid it. So that there was no place
    </p>
    <p>
     which was not more or less green; the footpaths were the greenest of
    </p>
    <p>
     all, for such is the nature of grass where it has once been trodden on,
    </p>
    <p>
     and by-and-by, as the summer came on, the former roads were thinly
    </p>
    <p>
     covered with the grass that had spread out from the margin.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the autumn, as the meadows were not mown, the grass withered as it
    </p>
    <p>
     stood, falling this way and that, as the wind had blown it; the seeds
    </p>
    <p>
     dropped, and the bennets became a greyish-white, or, where the docks and
    </p>
    <p>
     sorrel were thick, a brownish-red. The wheat, after it had ripened,
    </p>
    <p>
     there being no one to reap it, also remained standing, and was eaten by
    </p>
    <p>
     clouds of sparrows, rooks, and pigeons, which flocked to it and were
    </p>
    <p>
     undisturbed, feasting at their pleasure. As the winter came on, the
    </p>
    <p>
     crops were beaten down by the storms, soaked with rain, and trodden upon
    </p>
    <p>
     by herds of animals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next summer the prostrate straw of the preceding year was concealed by
    </p>
    <p>
     the young green wheat and barley that sprang up from the grain sown by
    </p>
    <p>
     dropping from the ears, and by quantities of docks, thistles, oxeye
    </p>
    <p>
     daisies, and similar plants. This matted mass grew up through the
    </p>
    <p>
     bleached straw. Charlock, too, hid the rotting roots in the fields under
    </p>
    <p>
     a blaze of yellow flower. The young spring meadow-grass could scarcely
    </p>
    <p>
     push its way up through the long dead grass and bennets of the year
    </p>
    <p>
     previous, but docks and thistles, sorrel, wild carrots, and nettles,
    </p>
    <p>
     found no such difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Footpaths were concealed by the second year, but roads could be traced,
    </p>
    <p>
     though as green as the sward, and were still the best for walking,
    </p>
    <p>
     because the tangled wheat and weeds, and, in the meadows, the long
    </p>
    <p>
     grass, caught the feet of those who tried to pass through. Year by year
    </p>
    <p>
     the original crops of wheat, barley, oats, and beans asserted their
    </p>
    <p>
     presence by shooting up, but in gradually diminished force, as nettles
    </p>
    <p>
     and coarser plants, such as the wild parsnips, spread out into the
    </p>
    <p>
     fields from the ditches and choked them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aquatic grasses from the furrows and water-carriers extended in the
    </p>
    <p>
     meadows, and, with the rushes, helped to destroy or take the place of
    </p>
    <p>
     the former sweet herbage. Meanwhile, the brambles, which grew very fast,
    </p>
    <p>
     had pushed forward their prickly runners farther and farther from the
    </p>
    <p>
     hedges till they had now reached ten or fifteen yards. The briars had
    </p>
    <p>
     followed, and the hedges had widened to three or four times their first
    </p>
    <p>
     breadth, the fields being equally contracted. Starting from all sides at
    </p>
    <p>
     once, these brambles and briars in the course of about twenty years met
    </p>
    <p>
     in the centre of the largest fields.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hawthorn bushes sprang up among them, and, protected by the briars and
    </p>
    <p>
     thorns from grazing animals, the suckers of elm-trees rose and
    </p>
    <p>
     flourished. Sapling ashes, oaks, sycamores, and horse-chestnuts, lifted
    </p>
    <p>
     their heads. Of old time the cattle would have eaten off the seed leaves
    </p>
    <p>
     with the grass so soon as they were out of the ground, but now most of
    </p>
    <p>
     the acorns that were dropped by birds, and the keys that were wafted by
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind, twirling as they floated, took root and grew into trees. By
    </p>
    <p>
     this time the brambles and briars had choked up and blocked the former
    </p>
    <p>
     roads, which were as impassable as the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
     No fields, indeed, remained, for where the ground was dry, the thorns,
    </p>
    <p>
     briars, brambles, and saplings already mentioned filled the space, and
    </p>
    <p>
     these thickets and the young trees had converted most part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     country into an immense forest. Where the ground was naturally moist,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the drains had become choked with willow roots, which, when confined
    </p>
    <p>
     in tubes, grow into a mass like the brush of a fox, sedges and flags and
    </p>
    <p>
     rushes covered it. Thorn bushes were there, too, but not so tall; they
    </p>
    <p>
     were hung with lichen. Besides the flags and reeds, vast quantities of
    </p>
    <p>
     the tallest cow-parsnips or "gicks" rose five or six feet high, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     willow herb with its stout stem, almost as woody as a shrub, filled
    </p>
    <p>
     every approach.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the thirtieth year there was not one single open place, the hills
    </p>
    <p>
     only excepted, where a man could walk, unless he followed the tracks of
    </p>
    <p>
     wild creatures or cut himself a path. The ditches, of course, had long
    </p>
    <p>
     since become full of leaves and dead branches, so that the water which
    </p>
    <p>
     should have run off down them stagnated, and presently spread out into
    </p>
    <p>
     the hollow places and by the corner of what had once been fields,
    </p>
    <p>
     forming marshes where the horsetails, flags, and sedges hid the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     As no care was taken with the brooks, the hatches upon them gradually
    </p>
    <p>
     rotted, and the force of the winter rains carried away the weak timbers,
    </p>
    <p>
     flooding the lower grounds, which became swamps of larger size. The
    </p>
    <p>
     dams, too, were drilled by water-rats, and the streams percolating
    </p>
    <p>
     through, slowly increased the size of these tunnels till the structure
    </p>
    <p>
     burst, and the current swept on and added to the floods below. Mill-dams
    </p>
    <p>
     stood longer, but, as the ponds silted up, the current flowed round and
    </p>
    <p>
     even through the mill-houses, which, going by degrees to ruin, were in
    </p>
    <p>
     some cases undermined till they fell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everywhere the lower lands adjacent to the streams had become marshes,
    </p>
    <p>
     some of them extending for miles in a winding line, and occasionally
    </p>
    <p>
     spreading out to a mile in breadth. This was particularly the case where
    </p>
    <p>
     brooks and streams of some volume joined the rivers, which were also
    </p>
    <p>
     blocked and obstructed in their turn, and the two, overflowing, covered
    </p>
    <p>
     the country around; for the rivers brought down trees and branches,
    </p>
    <p>
     timbers floated from the shore, and all kinds of similar materials,
    </p>
    <p>
     which grounded in the shallows or caught against snags, and formed huge
    </p>
    <p>
     piles where there had been weirs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes, after great rains, these piles swept away the timbers of the
    </p>
    <p>
     weir, driven by the irresistible power of the water, and then in its
    </p>
    <p>
     course the flood, carrying the balks before it like battering rams,
    </p>
    <p>
     cracked and split the bridges of solid stone which the ancients had
    </p>
    <p>
     built. These and the iron bridges likewise were overthrown, and
    </p>
    <p>
     presently quite disappeared, for the very foundations were covered with
    </p>
    <p>
     the sand and gravel silted up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, too, the sites of many villages and towns that anciently existed
    </p>
    <p>
     along the rivers, or on the lower lands adjoining, were concealed by the
    </p>
    <p>
     water and the mud it brought with it. The sedges and reeds that arose
    </p>
    <p>
     completed the work and left nothing visible, so that the mighty
    </p>
    <p>
     buildings of olden days were by these means utterly buried. And, as has
    </p>
    <p>
     been proved by those who have dug for treasures, in our time the very
    </p>
    <p>
     foundations are deep beneath the earth, and not to be got at for the
    </p>
    <p>
     water that oozes into the shafts that they have tried to sink through
    </p>
    <p>
     the sand and mud banks.
    </p>
    <p>
     From an elevation, therefore, there was nothing visible but endless
    </p>
    <p>
     forest and marsh. On the level ground and plains the view was limited to
    </p>
    <p>
     a short distance, because of the thickets and the saplings which had now
    </p>
    <p>
     become young trees. The downs only were still partially open, yet it was
    </p>
    <p>
     not convenient to walk upon them except in the tracks of animals,
    </p>
    <p>
     because of the long grass which, being no more regularly grazed upon by
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep, as was once the case, grew thick and tangled. Furze, too, and
    </p>
    <p>
     heath covered the slopes, and in places vast quantities of fern. There
    </p>
    <p>
     had always been copses of fir and beech and nut-tree covers, and these
    </p>
    <p>
     increased and spread, while bramble, briar, and hawthorn extended around
    </p>
    <p>
     them.
    </p>
    <p>
     By degrees the trees of the vale seemed as it were to invade and march
    </p>
    <p>
     up the hills, and, as we see in our time, in many places the downs are
    </p>
    <p>
     hidden altogether with a stunted kind of forest. But all the above
    </p>
    <p>
     happened in the time of the first generation. Besides these things a
    </p>
    <p>
     great physical change took place; but before I speak of that, it will be
    </p>
    <p>
     best to relate what effects were produced upon animals and men.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the first years after the fields were left to themselves, the fallen
    </p>
    <p>
     and over-ripe corn crops became the resort of innumerable mice. They
    </p>
    <p>
     swarmed to an incredible degree, not only devouring the grain upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     straw that had never been cut, but clearing out every single ear in the
    </p>
    <p>
     wheat-ricks that were standing about the country. Nothing remained in
    </p>
    <p>
     these ricks but straw, pierced with tunnels and runs, the home and
    </p>
    <p>
     breeding-place of mice, which thence poured forth into the fields. Such
    </p>
    <p>
     grain as had been left in barns and granaries, in mills, and in
    </p>
    <p>
     warehouses of the deserted towns, disappeared in the same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     When men tried to raise crops in small gardens and enclosures for their
    </p>
    <p>
     sustenance, these legions of mice rushed in and destroyed the produce of
    </p>
    <p>
     their labour. Nothing could keep them out, and if a score were killed, a
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred more supplied their place. These mice were preyed upon by
    </p>
    <p>
     kestrel hawks, owls, and weasels; but at first they made little or no
    </p>
    <p>
     appreciable difference. In a few years, however, the weasels, having
    </p>
    <p>
     such a superabundance of food, trebled in numbers, and in the same way
    </p>
    <p>
     the hawks, owls, and foxes increased. There was then some relief, but
    </p>
    <p>
     even now at intervals districts are invaded, and the granaries and the
    </p>
    <p>
     standing corn suffer from these depredations.
    </p>
    <p>
     This does not happen every year, but only at intervals, for it is
    </p>
    <p>
     noticed that mice abound very much more in some seasons than others. The
    </p>
    <p>
     extraordinary multiplication of these creatures was the means of
    </p>
    <p>
     providing food for the cats that had been abandoned in the towns, and
    </p>
    <p>
     came forth into the country in droves. Feeding on the mice, they became,
    </p>
    <p>
     in a very short time, quite wild, and their descendants now roam the
    </p>
    <p>
     forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     In our houses we still have several varieties of the domestic cat, such
    </p>
    <p>
     as the tortoise-shell, which is the most prized, but when the
    </p>
    <p>
     above-mentioned cats became wild, after a while the several varieties
    </p>
    <p>
     disappeared, and left but one wild kind. Those which are now so often
    </p>
    <p>
     seen in the forest, and which do so much mischief about houses and
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosures, are almost all greyish, some being striped, and they are
    </p>
    <p>
     also much longer in the body than the tame. A few are jet black; their
    </p>
    <p>
     skins are then preferred by hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the forest cat retires from the sight of man as much as possible,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet it is extremely fierce in defence of its young, and instances have
    </p>
    <p>
     been known where travellers in the woods have been attacked upon
    </p>
    <p>
     unwittingly approaching their dens. Dropping from the boughs of a tree
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the shoulders, the creature flies at the face, inflicting deep
    </p>
    <p>
     scratches and bites, exceedingly painful, and sometimes dangerous, from
    </p>
    <p>
     the tendency to fester. But such cases are rare, and the reason the
    </p>
    <p>
     forest cat is so detested is because it preys upon fowls and poultry,
    </p>
    <p>
     mounting with ease the trees or places where they roost.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost worse than the mice were the rats, which came out of the old
    </p>
    <p>
     cities in such vast numbers that the people who survived and saw them
    </p>
    <p>
     are related to have fled in fear. This terror, however, did not last so
    </p>
    <p>
     long as the evil of the mice, for the rats, probably not finding
    </p>
    <p>
     sufficient food when together, scattered abroad, and were destroyed
    </p>
    <p>
     singly by the cats and dogs, who slew them by thousands, far more than
    </p>
    <p>
     they could afterwards eat, so that the carcases were left to decay. It
    </p>
    <p>
     is said that, overcome with hunger, these armies of rats in some cases
    </p>
    <p>
     fell upon each other, and fed on their own kindred. They are still
    </p>
    <p>
     numerous, but do not appear to do the same amount of damage as is
    </p>
    <p>
     occasionally caused by the mice, when the latter invade the cultivated
    </p>
    <p>
     lands.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dogs, of course, like the cats, were forced by starvation into the
    </p>
    <p>
     fields, where they perished in incredible numbers. Of many species of
    </p>
    <p>
     dogs which are stated to have been plentiful among the ancients, we have
    </p>
    <p>
     now nothing but the name. The poodle is extinct, the Maltese terrier,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Pomeranian, the Italian greyhound, and, it is believed, great
    </p>
    <p>
     numbers of crosses and mongrels have utterly disappeared. There was none
    </p>
    <p>
     to feed them, and they could not find food for themselves, nor could
    </p>
    <p>
     they stand the rigour of the winter when exposed to the frost in the
    </p>
    <p>
     open air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some kinds, more hardy and fitted by nature for the chase, became wild,
    </p>
    <p>
     and their descendants are now found in the woods. Of these, there are
    </p>
    <p>
     three sorts which keep apart from each other, and are thought not to
    </p>
    <p>
     interbreed. The most numerous are the black. The black wood-dog is short
    </p>
    <p>
     and stoutly made, with shaggy hair, sometimes marked with white patches.
    </p>
    <p>
     There can be no doubt that it is the descendant of the ancient
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep-dog, for it is known that the sheep-dog was of that character, and
    </p>
    <p>
     it is said that those who used to keep sheep soon found their dogs
    </p>
    <p>
     abandon the fold, and join the wild troops that fell upon the sheep. The
    </p>
    <p>
     black wood-dogs hunt in packs of ten or more (as many as forty have been
    </p>
    <p>
     counted), and are the pest of the farmer, for, unless his flocks are
    </p>
    <p>
     protected at night within stockades or enclosures, they are certain to
    </p>
    <p>
     be attacked. Not satisfied with killing enough to satisfy hunger, these
    </p>
    <p>
     dogs tear and mangle for sheer delight of blood, and will destroy twenty
    </p>
    <p>
     times as many as they can eat, leaving the miserably torn carcases on
    </p>
    <p>
     the field. Nor are the sheep always safe by day if the wood-dogs happen
    </p>
    <p>
     to be hungry. The shepherd is, therefore, usually accompanied by two or
    </p>
    <p>
     three mastiffs, of whose great size and strength the others stand in
    </p>
    <p>
     awe. At night, and when in large packs, starving in the snow, not even
    </p>
    <p>
     the mastiffs can check them.
    </p>
    <p>
     No wood-dog, of any kind, has ever been known to attack man, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     hunter in the forest hears their bark in every direction without fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is, nevertheless, best to retire out of their way when charging sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     in packs, for they then seem seized with a blind fury, and some who have
    </p>
    <p>
     endeavoured to fight them have been thrown down and seriously mauled.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this has been in the blindness of their rush; no instance has ever
    </p>
    <p>
     been known of their purposely attacking man.
    </p>
    <p>
     These black wood-dogs will also chase and finally pull down cattle, if
    </p>
    <p>
     they can get within the enclosures, and even horses have fallen victims
    </p>
    <p>
     to their untiring thirst for blood. Not even the wild cattle can always
    </p>
    <p>
     escape, despite their strength, and they have been known to run down
    </p>
    <p>
     stags, though not their usual quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next kind of wild wood-dog is the yellow, a smaller animal, with
    </p>
    <p>
     smooth hair inclining to a yellow colour, which lives principally upon
    </p>
    <p>
     game, chasing all, from the hare to the stag. It is as swift, or nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     as swift, as the greyhound, and possesses greater endurance. In coursing
    </p>
    <p>
     the hare, it not uncommonly happens that these dogs start from the brake
    </p>
    <p>
     and take the hare, when nearly exhausted, from the hunter's hounds. They
    </p>
    <p>
     will in the same way follow a stag, which has been almost run down by
    </p>
    <p>
     the hunters, and bring him to bay, though in this case they lose their
    </p>
    <p>
     booty, dispersing through fear of man, when the hunters come up in a
    </p>
    <p>
     body.
    </p>
    <p>
     But such is their love of the chase, that they are known to assemble
    </p>
    <p>
     from their lairs at the distant sound of the horn, and, as the hunters
    </p>
    <p>
     ride through the woods, they often see the yellow dogs flitting along
    </p>
    <p>
     side by side with them through bush and fern. These animals sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
     hunt singly, sometimes in couples, and as the season advances, and
    </p>
    <p>
     winter approaches, in packs of eight or twelve. They never attack sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     or cattle, and avoid man, except when they perceive he is engaged in the
    </p>
    <p>
     chase. There is little doubt that they are the descendants of the dogs
    </p>
    <p>
     which the ancients called lurchers, crossed, perhaps, with the
    </p>
    <p>
     greyhound, and possibly other breeds. When the various species of dogs
    </p>
    <p>
     were thrown on their own resources, those only withstood the exposure
    </p>
    <p>
     and hardships which were naturally hardy, and possessed natural aptitude
    </p>
    <p>
     for the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     The third species of wood-dog is the white. They are low on the legs, of
    </p>
    <p>
     a dingy white colour, and much smaller than the other two. They neither
    </p>
    <p>
     attack cattle nor game, though fond of hunting rabbits. This dog is, in
    </p>
    <p>
     fact, a scavenger, living upon the carcases of dead sheep and animals,
    </p>
    <p>
     which are found picked clean in the night. For this purpose it haunts
    </p>
    <p>
     the neighbourhood of habitations, and prowls in the evening over heaps
    </p>
    <p>
     of refuse, scampering away at the least alarm, for it is extremely
    </p>
    <p>
     timid.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is perfectly harmless, for even the poultry do not dread it, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     will not face a tame cat, if by chance the two meet. It is rarely met
    </p>
    <p>
     with far from habitations, though it will accompany an army on the
    </p>
    <p>
     march. It may be said to remain in one district. The black and yellow
    </p>
    <p>
     dogs, on the contrary, roam about the forest without apparent home. One
    </p>
    <p>
     day the hunter sees signs of their presence, and perhaps may, for a
    </p>
    <p>
     month afterwards, not so much as hear a bark.
    </p>
    <p>
     This uncertainty in the case of the black dog is the bane of the
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherds; for, not seeing or hearing anything of the enemy for months
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether, in spite of former experience their vigilance relaxes, and
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly, while they sleep, their flocks are scattered. We still have,
    </p>
    <p>
     among tame dogs, the mastiff, terrier, spaniel, deerhound, and
    </p>
    <p>
     greyhound, all of which are as faithful to man as ever.

     CHAPTER II
    </head>
    <p>
     WILD ANIMALS
    </p>
    <p>
     When the ancients departed, great numbers of their cattle perished. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was not so much the want of food as the inability to endure exposure
    </p>
    <p>
     that caused their death; a few winters are related to have so reduced
    </p>
    <p>
     them that they died by hundreds, many mangled by dogs. The hardiest that
    </p>
    <p>
     remained became perfectly wild, and the wood cattle are now more
    </p>
    <p>
     difficult to approach than deer.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are two kinds, the white and the black. The white (sometimes dun)
    </p>
    <p>
     are believed to be the survivors of the domestic roan-and-white, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     cattle in our enclosures at the present day are of that colour. The
    </p>
    <p>
     black are smaller, and are doubtless little changed from their state in
    </p>
    <p>
     the olden times, except that they are wild. These latter are timid,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless accompanied by a calf, and are rarely known to turn upon their
    </p>
    <p>
     pursuers. But the white are fierce at all times; they will not, indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     attack man, but will scarcely run from him, and it is not always safe to
    </p>
    <p>
     cross their haunts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bulls are savage beyond measure at certain seasons of the year. If
    </p>
    <p>
     they see men at a distance, they retire; if they come unexpectedly face
    </p>
    <p>
     to face, they attack. This characteristic enables those who travel
    </p>
    <p>
     through districts known to be haunted by white cattle to provide against
    </p>
    <p>
     an encounter, for, by occasionally blowing a horn, the herd that may be
    </p>
    <p>
     in the vicinity is dispersed. There are not often more than twenty in a
    </p>
    <p>
     herd. The hides of the dun are highly prized, both for their intrinsic
    </p>
    <p>
     value, and as proofs of skill and courage, so much so that you shall
    </p>
    <p>
     hardly buy a skin for all the money you may offer; and the horns are
    </p>
    <p>
     likewise trophies. The white or dun bull is the monarch of our forests.
    </p>
    <p>
     Four kinds of wild pigs are found. The most numerous, or at least the
    </p>
    <p>
     most often seen, as it lies about our enclosures, is the common
    </p>
    <p>
     thorn-hog. It is the largest of the wild pigs, long-bodied and
    </p>
    <p>
     flat-sided, in colour much the hue of the mud in which it wallows. To
    </p>
    <p>
     the agriculturist it is the greatest pest, destroying or damaging all
    </p>
    <p>
     kinds of crops, and routing up the gardens. It is with difficulty kept
    </p>
    <p>
     out by palisading, for if there be a weak place in the wooden framework,
    </p>
    <p>
     the strong snout of the animal is sure to undermine and work a passage
    </p>
    <p>
     through.
    </p>
    <p>
     As there are always so many of these pigs round about inhabited places
    </p>
    <p>
     and cultivated fields, constant care is required, for they instantly
    </p>
    <p>
     discover an opening. From their habit of haunting the thickets and bush
    </p>
    <p>
     which come up to the verge of the enclosures, they have obtained the
    </p>
    <p>
     name of thorn-hogs. Some reach an immense size, and they are very
    </p>
    <p>
     prolific, so that it is impossible to destroy them. The boars are fierce
    </p>
    <p>
     at a particular season, but never attack unless provoked to do so. But
    </p>
    <p>
     when driven to bay they are the most dangerous of the boars, on account
    </p>
    <p>
     of their vast size and weight. They are of a sluggish disposition, and
    </p>
    <p>
     will not rise from their lairs unless forced to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next kind is the white hog, which has much the same habits as the
    </p>
    <p>
     former, except that it is usually found in moist places, near lakes and
    </p>
    <p>
     rivers, and is often called the marsh-pig. The third kind is perfectly
    </p>
    <p>
     black, much smaller in size, and very active, affording by far the best
    </p>
    <p>
     sport, and also the best food when killed. As they are found on the
    </p>
    <p>
     hills where the ground is somewhat more open, horses can follow freely,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the chase becomes exciting. By some it is called the hill-hog, from
    </p>
    <p>
     the locality it frequents. The small tusks of the black boar are used
    </p>
    <p>
     for many ornamental purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
     These three species are considered to be the descendants of the various
    </p>
    <p>
     domestic pigs of the ancients, but the fourth, or grey, is thought to be
    </p>
    <p>
     the true wild boar. It is seldom seen, but is most common in the
    </p>
    <p>
     south-western forests, where, from the quantity of fern, it is called
    </p>
    <p>
     the fern-pig. This kind is believed to represent the true wild boar,
    </p>
    <p>
     which was extinct, or merged in the domestic hog among the ancients,
    </p>
    <p>
     except in that neighbourhood where the strain remained.
    </p>
    <p>
     With wild times, the wild habits have returned, and the grey boar is at
    </p>
    <p>
     once the most difficult of access, and the most ready to encounter
    </p>
    <p>
     either dogs or men. Although the first, or thorn-hog, does the most
    </p>
    <p>
     damage to the agriculturist because of its numbers, and its habit of
    </p>
    <p>
     haunting the neighbourhood of enclosures, the others are equally
    </p>
    <p>
     injurious if they chance to enter the cultivated fields.
    </p>
    <p>
     The three principal kinds of wild sheep are the horned, the thyme, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the meadow. The thyme sheep are the smallest, and haunt the highest
    </p>
    <p>
     hills in the south, where, feeding on the sweet herbage of the ridges,
    </p>
    <p>
     their flesh is said to acquire a flavour of wild thyme. They move in
    </p>
    <p>
     small flocks of not more than thirty, and are the most difficult to
    </p>
    <p>
     approach, being far more wary than deer, so continuously are they hunted
    </p>
    <p>
     by the wood-dogs. The horned are larger, and move in greater numbers; as
    </p>
    <p>
     many as two hundred are sometimes seen together.
    </p>
    <p>
     They are found on the lower slopes and plains, and in the woods. The
    </p>
    <p>
     meadow sheep have long shaggy wool, which is made into various articles
    </p>
    <p>
     of clothing, but they are not numerous. They haunt river sides, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     shores of lakes and ponds. None of these are easily got at, on account
    </p>
    <p>
     of the wood-dogs; but the rams of the horned kind are reputed to
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes turn upon the pursuing pack, and butt them to death. In the
    </p>
    <p>
     extremity of their terror whole flocks of wild sheep have been driven
    </p>
    <p>
     over precipices and into quagmires and torrents.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides these, there are several other species whose haunt is local. On
    </p>
    <p>
     the islands, especially, different kinds are found. The wood-dogs will
    </p>
    <p>
     occasionally, in calm weather, swim out to an island and kill every
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the horses that were in use among the ancients the two wild species
    </p>
    <p>
     now found are known to have descended, a fact confirmed by their evident
    </p>
    <p>
     resemblance to the horses we still retain. The largest wild horse is
    </p>
    <p>
     almost black, or inclined to a dark colour, somewhat less in size than
    </p>
    <p>
     our present waggon horses, but of the same heavy make. It is, however,
    </p>
    <p>
     much swifter, on account of having enjoyed liberty for so long. It is
    </p>
    <p>
     called the bush-horse, being generally distributed among thickets and
    </p>
    <p>
     meadow-like lands adjoining water.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other species is called the hill-pony, from its habitat, the hills,
    </p>
    <p>
     and is rather less in size than our riding-horse. This latter is short
    </p>
    <p>
     and thick-set, so much so as not to be easily ridden by short persons
    </p>
    <p>
     without high stirrups. Neither of these wild horses are numerous, but
    </p>
    <p>
     neither are they uncommon. They keep entirely separate from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     As many as thirty mares are sometimes seen together, but there are
    </p>
    <p>
     districts where the traveller will not observe one for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tradition says that in the olden times there were horses of a slender
    </p>
    <p>
     build whose speed outstripped the wind, but of the breed of these famous
    </p>
    <p>
     racers not one is left. Whether they were too delicate to withstand
    </p>
    <p>
     exposure, or whether the wild dogs hunted them down is uncertain, but
    </p>
    <p>
     they are quite gone. Did but one exist, how eagerly it would be sought
    </p>
    <p>
     out, for in these days it would be worth its weight in gold, unless,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, as some affirm, such speed only endured for a mile or two.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not necessary, having written thus far of the animals, that
    </p>
    <p>
     anything be said of the birds of the woods, which every one knows were
    </p>
    <p>
     not always wild, and which can, indeed, be compared with such poultry as
    </p>
    <p>
     are kept in our enclosures. Such are the bush-hens, the wood-turkeys,
    </p>
    <p>
     the galenæ, the peacocks, the white duck and the white goose, all of
    </p>
    <p>
     which, though now wild as the hawk, are well known to have been once
    </p>
    <p>
     tame.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were deer, red and fallow, in numerous parks and chases of very
    </p>
    <p>
     old time, and these, having got loose, and having such immense tracts to
    </p>
    <p>
     roam over unmolested, went on increasing till now they are beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     computation, and I have myself seen a thousand head together. Within
    </p>
    <p>
     these forty years, as I learn, the roe-deer, too, have come down from
    </p>
    <p>
     the extreme north, so that there are now three sorts in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before them the pine-marten came from the same direction, and, though
    </p>
    <p>
     they are not yet common, it is believed they are increasing. For the
    </p>
    <p>
     first few years after the change took place there seemed a danger lest
    </p>
    <p>
     the foreign wild beasts that had been confined as curiosities in
    </p>
    <p>
     menageries should multiply and remain in the woods. But this did not
    </p>
    <p>
     happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some few lions, tigers, bears, and other animals did indeed escape,
    </p>
    <p>
     together with many less furious creatures, and it is related that they
    </p>
    <p>
     roamed about the fields for a long time. They were seldom met with,
    </p>
    <p>
     having such an extent of country to wander over, and after a while
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely disappeared. If any progeny were born, the winter frosts must
    </p>
    <p>
     have destroyed it, and the same fate awaited the monstrous serpents
    </p>
    <p>
     which had been collected for exhibition. Only one such animal now exists
    </p>
    <p>
     which is known to owe its origin to those which escaped from the dens of
    </p>
    <p>
     the ancients. It is the beaver, whose dams are now occasionally found
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the streams by those who traverse the woods. Some of the aquatic
    </p>
    <p>
     birds, too, which frequent the lakes, are thought to have been
    </p>
    <p>
     originally derived from those which were formerly kept as curiosities.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the castle yard at Longtover may still be seen the bones of an
    </p>
    <p>
     elephant which was found dying in the woods near that spot.

     MEN OF THE WOODS
    </p>
    <p>
     So far as this, all that I have stated has been clear, and there can be
    </p>
    <p>
     no doubt that what has been thus handed down from mouth to mouth is for
    </p>
    <p>
     the most part correct. When I pass from trees and animals to men,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, the thing is different, for nothing is certain and everything
    </p>
    <p>
     confused. None of the accounts agree, nor can they be altogether
    </p>
    <p>
     reconciled with present facts or with reasonable supposition; yet it is
    </p>
    <p>
     not so long since but a few memories, added one to the other, can bridge
    </p>
    <p>
     the time, and, though not many, there are some written notes still to be

     found. I must attribute the discrepancy to the wars and hatreds which

     sprang up and divided the people, so that one would not listen to what
    </p>
    <p>
     the others wished to say, and the truth was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides which, in the conflagration which consumed the towns, most of
    </p>
    <p>
     the records were destroyed, and are no longer to be referred to. And it
    </p>
    <p>
     may be that even when they were proceeding, the causes of the change
    </p>
    <p>
     were not understood. Therefore, what I am now about to describe is not
    </p>
    <p>
     to be regarded as the ultimate truth, but as the nearest to which I
    </p>
    <p>
     could attain after comparing the various traditions. Some say, then,
    </p>
    <p>
     that the first beginning of the change was because the sea silted up the
    </p>
    <p>
     entrances to the ancient ports, and stopped the vast commerce which was
    </p>
    <p>
     once carried on. It is certainly true that many of the ports are silted
    </p>
    <p>
     up, and are now useless as such, but whether the silting up preceded the
    </p>
    <p>
     disappearance of the population, or whether the disappearance of the
    </p>
    <p>
     population, and the consequent neglect caused the silting, I cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     venture to positively assert.
    </p>
    <p>
     For there are signs that the level of the sea has sunk in some places,
    </p>
    <p>
     and signs that it has become higher in others, so that the judicious
    </p>
    <p>
     historian will simply state the facts, and refrain from colouring them
    </p>
    <p>
     with his own theory as Silvester has done. Others again maintain that
    </p>
    <p>
     the supply of food from over the ocean suddenly stopping caused great
    </p>
    <p>
     disorders, and that the people crowded on board all the ships to escape
    </p>
    <p>
     starvation, and sailed away, and were no more heard of.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has, too, been said that the earth, from some attractive power
    </p>
    <p>
     exercised by the passage of an enormous dark body through space, became
    </p>
    <p>
     tilted or inclined to its orbit more than before, and that this, while
    </p>
    <p>
     it lasted, altered the flow of the magnetic currents, which, in an
    </p>
    <p>
     imperceptible manner, influence the minds of men. Hitherto the stream of
    </p>
    <p>
     human life had directed itself to the westward, but when this reversal
    </p>
    <p>
     of magnetism occurred, a general desire arose to return to the east. And
    </p>
    <p>
     those whose business is theology have pointed out that the wickedness of
    </p>
    <p>
     those times surpassed understanding, and that a change and sweeping away
    </p>
    <p>
     of the human evil that had accumulated was necessary, and was effected
    </p>
    <p>
     by supernatural means. The relation of this must be left to them, since
    </p>
    <p>
     it is not the province of the philosopher to meddle with such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
     All that seems certain is, that when the event took place, the immense
    </p>
    <p>
     crowds collected in cities were most affected, and that the richer and
    </p>
    <p>
     upper classes made use of their money to escape. Those left behind were
    </p>
    <p>
     mainly the lower and most ignorant, so far as the arts were concerned;
    </p>
    <p>
     those that dwelt in distant and outlying places; and those who lived by
    </p>
    <p>
     agriculture. These last at that date had fallen to such distress that
    </p>
    <p>
     they could not hire vessels to transport themselves. The exact number of
    </p>
    <p>
     those left behind cannot, of course, be told, but it is on record that
    </p>
    <p>
     when the fields were first neglected (as I have already described), a
    </p>
    <p>
     man might ride a hundred miles and not meet another. They were not only
    </p>
    <p>
     few, but scattered, and had not drawn together and formed towns as at
    </p>
    <p>
     present.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of what became of the vast multitudes that left the country, nothing has
    </p>
    <p>
     ever been heard, and no communication has been received from them. For
    </p>
    <p>
     this reason I cannot conceal my opinion that they must have sailed
    </p>
    <p>
     either to the westward or to the southward where the greatest extent of
    </p>
    <p>
     ocean is understood to exist, and not to the eastward as Silvester would
    </p>
    <p>
     have it in his work upon the "Unknown Orb", the dark body travelling in
    </p>
    <p>
     space to which I have alluded. None of our vessels in the present day
    </p>
    <p>
     dare venture into those immense tracts of sea, nor, indeed, out of sight
    </p>
    <p>
     of land, unless they know they shall see it again so soon as they have
    </p>
    <p>
     reached and surmounted the ridge of the horizon. Had they only crossed
    </p>
    <p>
     to the mainland or continent again, we should most likely have heard of
    </p>
    <p>
     their passage across the countries there.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is true that ships rarely come over, and only to two ports, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     the men on them say (so far as can be understood) that their country is
    </p>
    <p>
     equally deserted now, and has likewise lost its population. But still,
    </p>
    <p>
     as men talk unto men, and we pass intelligence across great breadths of
    </p>
    <p>
     land, it is almost certain that, had they travelled that way, some echo
    </p>
    <p>
     of their footsteps would yet sound back to us. Regarding this theory,
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore, as untenable, I put forward as a suggestion that the ancients
    </p>
    <p>
     really sailed to the west or to the south.
    </p>
    <p>
     As, for the most part, those who were left behind were ignorant, rude,
    </p>
    <p>
     and unlettered, it consequently happened that many of the marvellous
    </p>
    <p>
     things which the ancients did, and the secrets of their science, are
    </p>
    <p>
     known to us by name only, and, indeed, hardly by name. It has happened
    </p>
    <p>
     to us in our turn as it happened to the ancients. For they were aware
    </p>
    <p>
     that in times before their own the art of making glass malleable had
    </p>
    <p>
     been discovered, so that it could be beaten into shape like copper. But
    </p>
    <p>
     the manner in which it was accomplished was entirely unknown to them;
    </p>
    <p>
     the fact was on record, but the cause lost. So now we know that those
    </p>
    <p>
     who to us are the ancients had a way of making diamonds and precious
    </p>
    <p>
     stones out of black and lustreless charcoal, a fact which approaches the
    </p>
    <p>
     incredible. Still, we do not doubt it, though we cannot imagine by what
    </p>
    <p>
     means it was carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
     They also sent intelligence to the utmost parts of the earth along wires
    </p>
    <p>
     which were not tubular, but solid, and therefore could not transmit
    </p>
    <p>
     sound, and yet the person who received the message could hear and
    </p>
    <p>
     recognise the voice of the sender a thousand miles away. With certain
    </p>
    <p>
     machines worked by fire, they traversed the land swift as the swallow
    </p>
    <p>
     glides through the sky, but of these things not a relic remains to us.
    </p>
    <p>
     What metal-work or wheels or bars of iron were left, and might have
    </p>
    <p>
     given us a clue, were all broken up and melted down for use in other
    </p>
    <p>
     ways when metal became scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mounds of earth are said to still exist in the woods, which originally
    </p>
    <p>
     formed the roads for these machines, but they are now so low, and so
    </p>
    <p>
     covered with thickets, that nothing can be learnt from them; and,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, though I have heard of their existence, I have never seen one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Great holes were made through the very hills for the passage of the iron
    </p>
    <p>
     chariot, but they are now blocked by the falling roofs, nor dare any one
    </p>
    <p>
     explore such parts as may yet be open. Where are the wonderful
    </p>
    <p>
     structures with which the men of those days were lifted to the skies,
    </p>
    <p>
     rising above the clouds? These marvellous things are to us little more
    </p>
    <p>
     than fables of the giants and of the old gods that walked upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     earth, which were fables even to those whom we call the ancients.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, we have fuller knowledge of those extremely ancient times than
    </p>
    <p>
     of the people who immediately preceded us, and the Romans and the Greeks
    </p>
    <p>
     are more familiar to us than the men who rode in the iron chariots and
    </p>
    <p>
     mounted to the skies. The reason why so many arts and sciences were lost
    </p>
    <p>
     was because, as I have previously said, the most of those who were left
    </p>
    <p>
     in the country were ignorant, rude, and unlettered. They had seen the
    </p>
    <p>
     iron chariots, but did not understand the method of their construction,
    </p>
    <p>
     and could not hand down the knowledge they did not themselves possess.
    </p>
    <p>
     The magic wires of intelligence passed through their villages, but they
    </p>
    <p>
     did not know how to work them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cunning artificers of the cities all departed, and everything fell
    </p>
    <p>
     quickly into barbarism; nor could it be wondered at, for the few and
    </p>
    <p>
     scattered people of those days had enough to do to preserve their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Communication between one place and another was absolutely cut off, and
    </p>
    <p>
     if one perchance did recollect something that might have been of use, he
    </p>
    <p>
     could not confer with another who knew the other part, and thus between
    </p>
    <p>
     them reconstruct the machine. In the second generation even these
    </p>
    <p>
     disjointed memories died out.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first it is supposed that those who remained behind existed upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     grain in the warehouses, and what they could thresh by the flail from
    </p>
    <p>
     the crops left neglected in the fields. But as the provisions in the
    </p>
    <p>
     warehouses were consumed or spoiled, they hunted the animals, lately
    </p>
    <p>
     tame and as yet but half wild. As these grew less in number and
    </p>
    <p>
     difficult to overtake, they set to work again to till the ground, and
    </p>
    <p>
     cleared away small portions of the earth, encumbered already with
    </p>
    <p>
     brambles and thistles. Some grew corn, and some took charge of sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, in time, places far apart from each other were settled, and towns
    </p>
    <p>
     were built; towns, indeed, we call them to distinguish them from the
    </p>
    <p>
     champaign, but they are not worthy of the name in comparison with the
    </p>
    <p>
     mighty cities of old time.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many that have not more than fifty houses in the enclosure,
    </p>
    <p>
     and perhaps no other station within a day's journey, and the largest are
    </p>
    <p>
     but villages, reckoning by antiquity. For the most part they have their
    </p>
    <p>
     own government, or had till recently, and thus there grew up many
    </p>
    <p>
     provinces and kingdoms in the compass of what was originally but one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus separated and divided, there came also to be many races where in
    </p>
    <p>
     the first place was one people. Now, in briefly recounting the principal
    </p>
    <p>
     divisions of men, I will commence with those who are everywhere
    </p>
    <p>
     considered the lowest. These are the Bushmen, who live wholly in the
    </p>
    <p>
     woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even among the ancients, when every man, woman, and child could exercise
    </p>
    <p>
     those arts which are now the special mark of nobility, i.e. reading
    </p>
    <p>
     and writing, there was a degraded class of persons who refused to avail
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves of the benefits of civilization. They obtained their food by
    </p>
    <p>
     begging, wandering along the highways, crouching around fires which they
    </p>
    <p>
     lit in the open, clad in rags, and exhibiting countenances from which
    </p>
    <p>
     every trace of self-respect had disappeared. These were the ancestors of
    </p>
    <p>
     the present men of the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
     They took naturally to the neglected fields, and forming "camps" as they
    </p>
    <p>
     call their tribes, or rather families, wandered to and fro, easily
    </p>
    <p>
     subsisting upon roots and trapped game. So they live to this day, having
    </p>
    <p>
     become extremely dexterous in snaring every species of bird and animal,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the fishes of the streams. These latter they sometimes poison with a
    </p>
    <p>
     drug or a plant (it is not known which), the knowledge of which has been
    </p>
    <p>
     preserved among them since the days of the ancients. The poison kills
    </p>
    <p>
     the fishes, and brings them to the surface, when they can be collected
    </p>
    <p>
     by hundreds, but does not injure them for eating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like the black wood-dogs, the Bushmen often in fits of savage frenzy
    </p>
    <p>
     destroy thrice as much as they can devour, trapping deer in wickerwork
    </p>
    <p>
     hedges, or pitfalls, and cutting the miserable animals in pieces, for
    </p>
    <p>
     mere thirst of blood. The oxen and cattle in the enclosures are
    </p>
    <p>
     occasionally in the same manner fearfully mutilated by these wretches,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes for amusement, and sometimes in vengeance for injuries done to
    </p>
    <p>
     them. Bushmen have no settled home, cultivate no kind of corn or
    </p>
    <p>
     vegetable, keep no animals, not even dogs, have no houses or huts, no
    </p>
    <p>
     boats or canoes, nothing that requires the least intelligence or energy
    </p>
    <p>
     to construct.
    </p>
    <p>
     Roaming to and fro without any apparent aim or object, or any particular
    </p>
    <p>
     route, they fix their camp for a few days wherever it suits their fancy,
    </p>
    <p>
     and again move on, no man knows why or whither. It is this uncertainty
    </p>
    <p>
     of movement which makes them so dangerous. To-day there may not be the
    </p>
    <p>
     least sign of any within miles of an enclosure. In the night a "camp"
    </p>
    <p>
     may pass, slaughtering such cattle as may have remained without the
    </p>
    <p>
     palisade, or killing the unfortunate shepherd who has not got within the
    </p>
    <p>
     walls, and in the morning they may be nowhere to be seen, having
    </p>
    <p>
     disappeared like vermin. Face to face the Bushman is never to be feared;
    </p>
    <p>
     a whole "camp" or tribal family will scatter if a traveler stumbles into
    </p>
    <p>
     their midst. It is from behind a tree or under cover of night that he
    </p>
    <p>
     deals his murderous blow.
    </p>
    <p>
     A "camp" may consist of ten or twenty individuals, sometimes, perhaps,
    </p>
    <p>
     of forty, or even fifty, of various ages, and is ruled by the eldest,
    </p>
    <p>
     who is also the parent. He is absolute master of his "camp", but has no
    </p>
    <p>
     power or recognition beyond it, so that how many leaders there may be
    </p>
    <p>
     among them it is not possible even to guess. Nor is the master known to
    </p>
    <p>
     them as king, or duke, nor has he any title, but is simply the oldest or
    </p>
    <p>
     founder of the family. The "camp" has no law, no established custom;
    </p>
    <p>
     events happen, and even the master cannot be said to reign. When he
    </p>
    <p>
     becomes feeble, they simply leave him to die.
    </p>
    <p>
     They are depraved, and without shame, clad in sheep-skins chiefly, if
    </p>
    <p>
     clad at all, or in such clothes as they have stolen. They have no
    </p>
    <p>
     ceremonies whatever. The number of these "camps" must be considerable,
    </p>
    <p>
     and yet the Bushman is seldom seen, nor do we very often hear of their
    </p>
    <p>
     depredations, which is accounted for by the extent of country they
    </p>
    <p>
     wander over. It is in severe winters that the chief danger occurs; they
    </p>
    <p>
     then suffer from hunger and cold, and are driven to the neighbourhood of
    </p>
    <p>
     the enclosures to steal. So dexterous are they in slipping through the
    </p>
    <p>
     bushes, and slinking among the reeds and osiers, that they will pass
    </p>
    <p>
     within a few yards without discovering their presence, and the signs of
    </p>
    <p>
     their passage can be detected only by the experienced hunter, and not
    </p>
    <p>
     always by him.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is observed that whatever mischief the Bushman commits, he never sets
    </p>
    <p>
     fire to any ricks or buildings; the reason is because his nature is to
    </p>
    <p>
     slink from the scene of his depredations, and flame at once attracts
    </p>
    <p>
     people to the spot. Twice the occurrence of a remarkably severe winter
    </p>
    <p>
     has caused the Bushmen to flock together and act in an approach to
    </p>
    <p>
     concert in attacking the enclosures. The Bushmen of the north, who were
    </p>
    <p>
     even more savage and brutal, then came down, and were with difficulty
    </p>
    <p>
     repulsed from the walled cities. In ordinary times we see very little of
    </p>
    <p>
     them. They are the thieves, the human vermin of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the name of gipsies, those who are now often called Romany and
    </p>
    <p>
     Zingari were well known to the ancients. Indeed, they boast that their
    </p>
    <p>
     ancestry goes back so much farther than the oldest we can claim, that
    </p>
    <p>
     the ancients themselves were but modern to them. Even in that age of
    </p>
    <p>
     highest civilization, which immediately preceded the present, they say
    </p>
    <p>
     (and there is no doubt of it) that they preserved the blood of their
    </p>
    <p>
     race pure and untainted, that they never dwelt under permanent roofs,
    </p>
    <p>
     nor bowed their knees to the prevalent religion. They remained apart,
    </p>
    <p>
     and still continue after civilization has disappeared, exactly the same
    </p>
    <p>
     as they were before it commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since the change their numbers have greatly increased, and were they not
    </p>
    <p>
     always at war with each other, it is possible that they might go far to
    </p>
    <p>
     sweep the house people from the land. But there are so many tribes, each
    </p>
    <p>
     with its king, queen, or duke, that their power is divided, and their
    </p>
    <p>
     force melts away. The ruler of the Bushman families is always a man, but
    </p>
    <p>
     among the gipsies a woman, and even a young girl, often exercises
    </p>
    <p>
     supreme authority, but must be of the sacred blood. These kings and
    </p>
    <p>
     dukes are absolute autocrats within their tribe, and can order by a nod
    </p>
    <p>
     the destruction of those who offend them. Habits of simplest obedience
    </p>
    <p>
     being enjoined on the tribe from earliest childhood, such executions are
    </p>
    <p>
     rare, but the right to command them is not for a moment questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of the sorcerers, and particularly the sorceresses, among them, all have
    </p>
    <p>
     heard, and, indeed, the places where they dwell seem full of mystery and
    </p>
    <p>
     magic. They live in tents, and though they constantly remove from
    </p>
    <p>
     district to district, one tribe never clashes with or crosses another,
    </p>
    <p>
     because all have their especial routes, upon which no intrusion is ever
    </p>
    <p>
     made. Some agriculture is practiced, and flocks and herds are kept, but
    </p>
    <p>
     the work is entirely done by the women. The men are always on horseback,
    </p>
    <p>
     or sleeping in their tents.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each tribe has its central camping-place, to which they return at
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals after perhaps wandering for months, a certain number of
    </p>
    <p>
     persons being left at home to defend it. These camps are often situated
    </p>
    <p>
     in inaccessible positions, and well protected by stockades. The
    </p>
    <p>
     territory which is acknowledged to belong to such a camp is extremely
    </p>
    <p>
     limited; its mere environs only are considered the actual property of
    </p>
    <p>
     the tribe, and a second can pitch its tents with a few hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
     These stockades, in fact, are more like store-houses than residences;
    </p>
    <p>
     each is a mere rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gipsies are everywhere, but their stockades are most numerous in the
    </p>
    <p>
     south, along the sides of the green hills and plains, and especially
    </p>
    <p>
     round Stonehenge, where, on the great open plains, among the huge
    </p>
    <p>
     boulders, placed ages since in circles, they perform strange ceremonies
    </p>
    <p>
     and incantations. They attack every traveller, and every caravan or
    </p>
    <p>
     train of waggons which they feel strong enough to master, but they do
    </p>
    <p>
     not murder the solitary sleeping hunter or shepherd like the Bushmen.
    </p>
    <p>
     They will, indeed, steal from him, but do not kill, except in fight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once, now and then, they have found their way into towns, when terrible
    </p>
    <p>
     massacres have followed, for, when excited, the savage knows not how to
    </p>
    <p>
     restrain himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vengeance is their idol. If any community has injured or affronted them,
    </p>
    <p>
     they never cease endeavouring to retaliate, and will wipe it out in fire
    </p>
    <p>
     and blood generations afterwards. There are towns which have thus been
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly harried when the citizens had forgotten that any cause of
    </p>
    <p>
     enmity existed. Vengeance is their religion and their social law, which
    </p>
    <p>
     guides all their actions among themselves. It is for this reason that
    </p>
    <p>
     they are continually at war, duke with duke, and king with king. A
    </p>
    <p>
     deadly feud, too, has set Bushman and gipsy at each other's throat, far
    </p>
    <p>
     beyond the memory of man. The Romany looks on the Bushman as a dog, and
    </p>
    <p>
     slaughters him as such. In turn, the despised human dog slinks in the
    </p>
    <p>
     darkness of the night into the Romany's tent, and stabs his daughter or
    </p>
    <p>
     his wife, for such is the meanness and cowardice of the Bushman that he
    </p>
    <p>
     would always rather kill a woman than a man.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is also a third class of men who are not true gipsies, but have
    </p>
    <p>
     something of their character, though the gipsies will not allow that
    </p>
    <p>
     they were originally half-breeds. Their habits are much the same, except
    </p>
    <p>
     that they are foot men and rarely use horses, and are therefore called
    </p>
    <p>
     the foot gipsies. The gipsy horse is really a pony. Once only have the
    </p>
    <p>
     Romany combined to attack the house people, driven, like the Bushmen, by
    </p>
    <p>
     an exceedingly severe winter, against which they had no provision.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, then, instead of massing their forces and throwing their
    </p>
    <p>
     irresistible numbers upon one city or territory, all they would agree to
    </p>
    <p>
     do was that, upon a certain day, each tribe should invade the land
    </p>
    <p>
     nearest to it. The result was that they were, though with trouble,
    </p>
    <p>
     repulsed. Until lately, no leader ventured to follow the gipsies to
    </p>
    <p>
     their strongholds, for they were reputed invincible behind their
    </p>
    <p>
     stockades. By infesting the woods and lying in ambush they rendered
    </p>
    <p>
     communication between city and city difficult and dangerous, except to
    </p>
    <p>
     bodies of armed men, and every waggon had to be defended by troops.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gipsies, as they roam, make little secret of their presence (unless,
    </p>
    <p>
     of course, intent upon mischief), but light their fires by day and night
    </p>
    <p>
     fearlessly. The Bushmen never light a fire by day, lest the ascending
    </p>
    <p>
     smoke, which cannot be concealed, should betray their whereabouts. Their
    </p>
    <p>
     fires are lit at night in hollows or places well surrounded with
    </p>
    <p>
     thickets, and, that the flame may not be seen, they will build screens
    </p>
    <p>
     of fir boughs or fern. When they have obtained a good supply of hot wood
    </p>
    <p>
     coals, no more sticks are thrown on, but these are covered with turf,
    </p>
    <p>
     and thus kept in long enough for their purposes. Much of their meat they
    </p>
    <p>
     devour raw, and thus do not need a fire so frequently as others.

     CHAPTER IV
    </head>
    <p>
     THE INVADERS
    </p>
    <p>
     Those who live by agriculture or in towns, and are descended from the
    </p>
    <p>
     remnant of the ancients, are divided, as I have previously said, into
    </p>
    <p>
     numerous provinces, kingdoms, and republics. In the middle part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     country the cities are almost all upon the shores of the Lake, or within
    </p>
    <p>
     a short distance of the water, and there is therefore more traffic and
    </p>
    <p>
     communication between them by means of vessels than is the case with
    </p>
    <p>
     inland towns, whose trade must be carried on by caravans and waggons.
    </p>
    <p>
     These not only move slowly, but are subject to be interrupted by the
    </p>
    <p>
     Romany and by the banditti, or persons who, for moral or political
    </p>
    <p>
     crimes, have been banished from their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is in the cities that cluster around the great central lake that all
    </p>
    <p>
     the life and civilization of our day are found; but there also begin
    </p>
    <p>
     those wars and social convulsions which cause so much suffering. When
    </p>
    <p>
     was the Peninsula at peace? and when was there not some mischief and
    </p>
    <p>
     change brewing in the republics? When was there not a danger from the
    </p>
    <p>
     northern mainland?
    </p>
    <p>
     Until recent years there was little knowledge of, and scarcely any
    </p>
    <p>
     direct commerce or intercourse between, the central part and the
    </p>
    <p>
     districts either of the extreme west or the north, and it is only now
    </p>
    <p>
     that the north and east are becoming open to us; for at the back of the
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow circle or cultivated land, the belt about the Lake, there extend
    </p>
    <p>
     immense forests in every direction, through which, till very lately, no
    </p>
    <p>
     practicable way had been cut. Even in the more civilized central part it
    </p>
    <p>
     is not to this day easy to travel, for at the barriers, as you approach
    </p>
    <p>
     the territories of every prince, they demand your business and your
    </p>
    <p>
     papers; nor even if you establish the fact that you are innocent of
    </p>
    <p>
     designs against the State, shall you hardly enter without satisfying the
    </p>
    <p>
     greed of the officials.
    </p>
    <p>
     A fine is thus exacted at the gate of every province and kingdom, and
    </p>
    <p>
     again at the gateways of the towns. The difference of the coinage, such
    </p>
    <p>
     as it is, causes also great loss and trouble, for the money of one
    </p>
    <p>
     kingdom (though passing current by command in that territory) is not
    </p>
    <p>
     received at its nominal value in the next on account of the alloy it
    </p>
    <p>
     contains. It is, indeed, in many kingdoms impossible to obtain sterling
    </p>
    <p>
     money. Gold there is little or none anywhere, but silver is the standard
    </p>
    <p>
     of exchange, and copper, bronze, and brass, sometimes tin, are the
    </p>
    <p>
     metals with which the greater number of the people transact their
    </p>
    <p>
     business.
    </p>
    <p>
     Justice is corrupt, for where there is a king or a prince it depends on
    </p>
    <p>
     the caprice of a tyrant, and where there is a republic upon the shout of
    </p>
    <p>
     the crowd, so that many, if they think they may be put on trial, rather
    </p>
    <p>
     than face the risk at once escape into the woods. The League, though
    </p>
    <p>
     based ostensibly on principles the most exalted and beneficial to
    </p>
    <p>
     humanity, is known to be perverted. The members sworn to honour and the
    </p>
    <p>
     highest virtue are swayed by vile motives, political hatreds, and
    </p>
    <p>
     private passions, and even by money.
    </p>
    <p>
     Men for ever trample upon men, each pushing to the front; nor is there
    </p>
    <p>
     safety in remaining in retirement, since such are accused of biding
    </p>
    <p>
     their time and of occult designs. Though the population of these cities
    </p>
    <p>
     all counted together is not equal to the population that once dwelt in a
    </p>
    <p>
     single second-rate city of the ancients, yet how much greater are the
    </p>
    <p>
     bitterness and the struggle!
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet not content with the bloodshed they themselves cause, the tyrants
    </p>
    <p>
     have called in the aid of mercenary soldiers to assist them. And, to
    </p>
    <p>
     complete the disgrace, those republics which proclaim themselves the
    </p>
    <p>
     very home of patriotic virtues, have resorted to the same means. Thus we
    </p>
    <p>
     see English cities kept in awe by troops of Welshmen, Irish, and even
    </p>
    <p>
     the western Scots, who swarm in the council-chambers of the republics,
    </p>
    <p>
     and, opening the doors of the houses, help themselves to what they will.
    </p>
    <p>
     This, too, in the face of the notorious fact that these nations have
    </p>
    <p>
     sworn to be avenged upon us, that their vessels sail about the Lake
    </p>
    <p>
     committing direful acts of piracy, and that twice already vast armies
    </p>
    <p>
     have swept along threatening to entirely overwhelm the whole
    </p>
    <p>
     commonwealth.
    </p>
    <p>
     What infatuation to admit bands of these same men into the very
    </p>
    <p>
     strongholds and the heart of the land! As if upon the approach of their
    </p>
    <p>
     countrymen they would remain true to the oaths they have sworn for pay,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not rather admit them with open arms. No blame can, upon a just
    </p>
    <p>
     consideration, be attributed to either of these nations that endeavour
    </p>
    <p>
     to oppress us. For, as they point out, the ancients from whom we are
    </p>
    <p>
     descended held them in subjection many hundred years, and took from them
    </p>
    <p>
     all their liberties.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus the Welsh, or, as they call themselves, the Cymry, say that the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole island was once theirs, and is theirs still by right of
    </p>
    <p>
     inheritance. They were the original people who possessed it ages before
    </p>
    <p>
     the arrival of those whom we call the ancients. Though they were driven
    </p>
    <p>
     into the mountains of the far distant west, they never forgot their
    </p>
    <p>
     language, ceased their customs, or gave up their aspirations to recover
    </p>
    <p>
     their own. This is now their aim, and until recently it seemed as if
    </p>
    <p>
     they were about to accomplish it. For they held all that country
    </p>
    <p>
     anciently called Cornwall, having crossed over the Severn, and marched
    </p>
    <p>
     down the southern shore. The rich land of Devon, part of Dorset (all,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, that is inhabited), and the most part of Somerset, acknowledged
    </p>
    <p>
     their rule. Worcester and Hereford and Gloucester were theirs; I mean,
    </p>
    <p>
     of course, those parts that are not forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their outposts were pushed forward to the centre of Leicestershire, and
    </p>
    <p>
     came down towards Oxford. But thereabouts they met with the forces of
    </p>
    <p>
     which I will shortly speak. Then their vessels every summer sailing from
    </p>
    <p>
     the Severn, came into the Lake, and, landing wherever there was an
    </p>
    <p>
     opportunity, they destroyed all things and carried off the spoil. Is it
    </p>
    <p>
     necessary to say more to demonstrate the madness which possesses those
    </p>
    <p>
     princes and republics which, in order to support their own tyranny, have
    </p>
    <p>
     invited bands of these men into their very palaces and forts?
    </p>
    <p>
     As they approached near what was once Oxford and is now Sypolis, the
    </p>
    <p>
     armies of the Cymry came into collision with another of our invaders,
    </p>
    <p>
     and thus their forward course to the south was checked. The Irish, who
    </p>
    <p>
     had hitherto abetted them, turned round to defend their own usurpations.
    </p>
    <p>
     They, too, say that in conquering and despoiling my countrymen they are
    </p>
    <p>
     fulfilling a divine vengeance. Their land of Ireland had been for
    </p>
    <p>
     centuries ground down with an iron tyranny by our ancestors, who closed
    </p>
    <p>
     their lips with a muzzle, and led them about with a bridle, as their
    </p>
    <p>
     poets say. But now the hateful Saxons (for thus both they and the Welsh
    </p>
    <p>
     designate us) are broken, and delivered over to them for their spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not possible to deny many of the statements that they make, but
    </p>
    <p>
     that should not prevent us from battling with might and main against the
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened subjection. What crime can be greater than the admission of
    </p>
    <p>
     such foreigners as the guards of our cities? Now the Irish have their
    </p>
    <p>
     principal rendezvous and capital near to the ancient city of Chester,
    </p>
    <p>
     which is upon the ocean, and at the very top and angle of Wales. This is
    </p>
    <p>
     their great settlement, their magazine and rallying-place, and thence
    </p>
    <p>
     their expeditions have proceeded. It is a convenient port, and well
    </p>
    <p>
     opposite their native land, from which reinforcements continually
    </p>
    <p>
     arrive, but the Welsh have ever looked upon their possession of it with
    </p>
    <p>
     jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the period when the Cymry had nearly penetrated to Sypolis or Oxford,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Irish, on their part, had overrun all the cultivated and inhabited
    </p>
    <p>
     country in a south and south-easterly line from Chester, through Rutland
    </p>
    <p>
     to Norfolk and Suffolk, and even as far as Luton. They would have spread
    </p>
    <p>
     to the north, but in that direction they were met by the Scots, who had
    </p>
    <p>
     all Northumbria. When the Welsh came near Sypolis, the Irish awoke to
    </p>
    <p>
     the position of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sypolis is the largest and most important city upon the northern shore
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Lake, and it is situated at the entrance to the neck of land that
    </p>
    <p>
     stretches out to the straits. If the Welsh were once well posted there,
    </p>
    <p>
     the Irish could never hope to find their way to the rich and cultivated
    </p>
    <p>
     south, for it is just below Sypolis that the Lake contracts, and forms a
    </p>
    <p>
     strait in one place but a furlong wide. The two forces thus came into
    </p>
    <p>
     collision, and while they fought and destroyed each other, Sypolis was
    </p>
    <p>
     saved. After which, finding they were evenly matched, the Irish withdrew
    </p>
    <p>
     two days' march northwards, and the Cymry as far westwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     But now the Irish, sailing round the outside of Wales, came likewise up
    </p>
    <p>
     through the Red Rocks, and so into the Lake, and in their turn landing,
    </p>
    <p>
     harassed the cities. Often Welsh and Irish vessels, intending to attack
    </p>
    <p>
     the same place, have discerned each other approaching, and, turning from
    </p>
    <p>
     their proposed action, have flown at each other's throats. The Scots
    </p>
    <p>
     have not harassed us in the south much, being too far distant, and those
    </p>
    <p>
     that wander hither come for pay, taking service as guards. They are,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, the finest of men, and the hardiest to battle with. I had
    </p>
    <p>
     forgotten to mention that it is possible the Irish might have pushed
    </p>
    <p>
     back the Welsh, had not the kingdom of York suddenly reviving, by means
    </p>
    <p>
     which shall be related, valiantly thrust out its masters, and fell upon
    </p>
    <p>
     their rear.
    </p>
    <p>
     But still these nations are always upon the verge and margin of our
    </p>
    <p>
     world, and wait but an opportunity to rush in upon it. Our countrymen
    </p>
    <p>
     groan under their yoke, and I say again that infamy should be the
    </p>
    <p>
     portion of those rulers among us who have filled their fortified places
    </p>
    <p>
     with mercenaries derived from such sources.
    </p>
    <p>
     The land, too, is weak, because of the multitude of bondsmen. In the
    </p>
    <p>
     provinces and kingdoms round about the Lake there is hardly a town where
    </p>
    <p>
     the slaves do not outnumber the free as ten to one. The laws are framed
    </p>
    <p>
     for the object of reducing the greater part of the people to servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     For every offence the punishment is slavery, and the offences are daily
    </p>
    <p>
     artificially increased, that the wealth of the few in human beings may
    </p>
    <p>
     grow with them. If a man in his hunger steal a loaf, he becomes a slave;
    </p>
    <p>
     that is, it is proclaimed he must make good to the State the injury he
    </p>
    <p>
     has done it, and must work out his trespass. This is not assessed as the
    </p>
    <p>
     value of the loaf, nor supposed to be confined to the individual from
    </p>
    <p>
     whom it was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
     The theft is said to damage the State at large, because it corrupts the
    </p>
    <p>
     morality of the commonwealth; it is as if the thief had stolen a loaf,
    </p>
    <p>
     not from one, but from every member of the State. Restitution must,
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore, be made to all, and the value of the loaf returned in labour
    </p>
    <p>
     a thousandfold. The thief is the bondsman of the State. But as the State
    </p>
    <p>
     cannot employ him, he is leased out to those who will pay into the
    </p>
    <p>
     treasury of the prince the money equivalent to the labour he is capable
    </p>
    <p>
     of performing. Thus, under cover of the highest morality, the greatest
    </p>
    <p>
     iniquity is perpetrated. For the theft of a loaf, the man is reduced to
    </p>
    <p>
     a slave; then his wife and children, unable to support themselves,
    </p>
    <p>
     become a charge to the State, that is, they beg in the public ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     This, too, forsooth, corrupts morality, and they likewise are seized and
    </p>
    <p>
     leased out to any who like to take them. Nor can he or they ever become
    </p>
    <p>
     free again, for they must repay to their proprietor the sum he gave for
    </p>
    <p>
     them, and how can that be done, since they receive no wages? For
    </p>
    <p>
     striking another, a man may be in the same way, as they term it,
    </p>
    <p>
     forfeited to the State, and be sold to the highest bidder. A stout brass
    </p>
    <p>
     wire is then twisted around his left wrist loosely, and the ends
    </p>
    <p>
     soldered together. Then a bar of iron being put through, a half turn is
    </p>
    <p>
     given to it, which forces the wire sharply against the arm, causing it
    </p>
    <p>
     to fit tightly, often painfully, and forms a smaller ring at the
    </p>
    <p>
     outside. By this smaller ring a score of bondsmen may be seen strung
    </p>
    <p>
     together with a rope.
    </p>
    <p>
     To speak disrespectfully of the prince or his council, or of the nobles,
    </p>
    <p>
     or of religion, to go out of the precincts without permission, to trade
    </p>
    <p>
     without license, to omit to salute the great, all these and a thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     others are crimes deserving of the brazen bracelet. Were a man to study
    </p>
    <p>
     all day what he must do, and what he must not do, to escape servitude,
    </p>
    <p>
     it would not be possible for him to stir one step without becoming
    </p>
    <p>
     forfeit! And yet they hypocritically say that these things are done for
    </p>
    <p>
     the sake of public morality, and that there are not slaves (not
    </p>
    <p>
     permitting the word to be used), and no man was ever sold.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is, indeed, true that no man is sold in open market, he is leased
    </p>
    <p>
     instead; and, by a refined hypocrisy, the owner of slaves cannot sell
    </p>
    <p>
     them to another owner, but he can place them in the hands of the notary,
    </p>
    <p>
     presenting them with their freedom, so far as he is concerned. The
    </p>
    <p>
     notary, upon payment of a fine from the purchaser, transfers them to
    </p>
    <p>
     him, and the larger part of the fine goes to the prince. Debt alone
    </p>
    <p>
     under their laws must crowd the land with slaves, for, as wages are
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely known, a child from its birth is often declared to be in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
     For its nourishment is drawn from its mother, and the wretched mother is
    </p>
    <p>
     the wife of a retainer who is fed by his lord. To such a degree is this
    </p>
    <p>
     tyranny carried! If any owe a penny, his doom is sealed; he becomes a
    </p>
    <p>
     bondsman, and thus the estates of the nobles are full of men who work
    </p>
    <p>
     during their whole lives for the profit of others. Thus, too, the woods
    </p>
    <p>
     are filled with banditti, for those who find an opportunity never fail
    </p>
    <p>
     to escape, notwithstanding the hunt that is invariably made for them,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the cruel punishment that awaits recapture. And numbers, foreseeing
    </p>
    <p>
     that they must become bondsmen, before they are proclaimed forfeit steal
    </p>
    <p>
     away by night, and live as they may in the forests.
    </p>
    <p>
     How, then, does any man remain free? Only by the favour of the nobles,
    </p>
    <p>
     and only that he may amass wealth for them. The merchants, and those who
    </p>
    <p>
     have license to trade by land or water, are all protected by some noble
    </p>
    <p>
     house, to whom they pay heavily for permission to live in their own
    </p>
    <p>
     houses. The principal tyrant is supported by the nobles, that they in
    </p>
    <p>
     their turn may tyrannise over the merchants, and they again over all the
    </p>
    <p>
     workmen of their shops and bazaars.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over their own servants (for thus they call the slaves, that the word
    </p>
    <p>
     itself may not be used), who work upon their estates, the nobles are
    </p>
    <p>
     absolute masters, and may even hang them upon the nearest tree. And here
    </p>
    <p>
     I cannot but remark how strange it is, first, that any man can remain a
    </p>
    <p>
     slave rather than die; and secondly, how much stranger it is that any
    </p>
    <p>
     other man, himself a slave, can be found to hunt down or to hang his
    </p>
    <p>
     fellow; yet the tyrants never lack executioners. Their castles are
    </p>
    <p>
     crowded with retainers who wreak their wills upon the defenceless. These
    </p>
    <p>
     retainers do not wear the brazen bracelet; they are free. Are there,
    </p>
    <p>
     then, no beggars? Yes, they sit at every corner, and about the gates of
    </p>
    <p>
     the cities, asking for alms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though begging makes a man forfeit to the State, it is only when he has
    </p>
    <p>
     thews and sinews, and can work. The diseased and aged, the helpless and
    </p>
    <p>
     feeble, may break the law, and starve by the roadside, because it
    </p>
    <p>
     profits no one to make them his slaves. And all these things are done in
    </p>
    <p>
     the name of morality, and for the good of the human race, as they
    </p>
    <p>
     constantly announce in their councils and parliaments.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are two reasons why the mercenaries have been called in; first,
    </p>
    <p>
     because the princes found the great nobles so powerful, and can keep
    </p>
    <p>
     them in check only by the aid of these foreigners; and secondly, because
    </p>
    <p>
     the number of the outlaws in the woods has become so great that the
    </p>
    <p>
     nobles themselves are afraid lest their slaves should revolt, and, with
    </p>
    <p>
     the aid of the outlaws, overcome them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the mark of a noble is that he can read and write. When the ancients
    </p>
    <p>
     were scattered, the remnant that was left behind was, for the most part,
    </p>
    <p>
     the ignorant and the poor. But among them there was here and there a man
    </p>
    <p>
     who possessed some little education and force of mind. At first there
    </p>
    <p>
     was no order; but after thirty years or so, after a generation, some
    </p>
    <p>
     order grew up, and these men, then become aged, were naturally chosen as
    </p>
    <p>
     leaders. They had, indeed, no actual power then, no guards or armies;
    </p>
    <p>
     but the common folk, who had no knowledge, came to them for decision of
    </p>
    <p>
     their disputes, for advice what to do, for the pronouncement of some
    </p>
    <p>
     form of marriage, for the keeping of some note of property, and to be
    </p>
    <p>
     united against a mutual danger.
    </p>
    <p>
     These men in turn taught their children to read and write, wishing that
    </p>
    <p>
     some part of the wisdom of the ancients might be preserved. They
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves wrote down what they knew, and these manuscripts, transmitted
    </p>
    <p>
     to their children, were saved with care. Some of them remain to this
    </p>
    <p>
     day. These children, growing to manhood, took more upon them, and
    </p>
    <p>
     assumed higher authority as the past was forgotten, and the original
    </p>
    <p>
     equality of all men lost in antiquity. The small enclosed farms of their
    </p>
    <p>
     fathers became enlarged to estates, the estates became towns, and thus,
    </p>
    <p>
     by degrees, the order of the nobility was formed. As they intermarried
    </p>
    <p>
     only among themselves, they preserved a certain individuality. At this
    </p>
    <p>
     day a noble is at once known, no matter how coarsely he may be dressed,
    </p>
    <p>
     or how brutal his habits, by his delicacy of feature, his air of
    </p>
    <p>
     command, even by his softness of skin and fineness of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still the art of reading and writing is scrupulously imparted to all
    </p>
    <p>
     their legitimate offspring, and scrupulously confined to them alone. It
    </p>
    <p>
     is true that they do not use it except on rare occasions when necessity
    </p>
    <p>
     demands, being wholly given over to the chase, to war, and politics, but
    </p>
    <p>
     they retain the knowledge. Indeed, were a noble to be known not to be
    </p>
    <p>
     able to read and write, the prince would at once degrade him, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     sentence would be upheld by the entire caste. No other but the nobles
    </p>
    <p>
     are permitted to acquire these arts; if any attempt to do so, they are
    </p>
    <p>
     enslaved and punished. But none do attempt; of what avail would it be to
    </p>
    <p>
     them?
    </p>
    <p>
     All knowledge is thus retained in the possession of the nobles; they do
    </p>
    <p>
     not use it, but the physicians, for instance, who are famous, are so
    </p>
    <p>
     because by favour of some baron, they have learned receipts in the
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient manuscripts which have been mentioned. One virtue, and one only,
    </p>
    <p>
     adorns this exclusive caste; they are courageous to the verge of
    </p>
    <p>
     madness. I had almost omitted to state that the merchants know how to
    </p>
    <p>
     read and write, having special license and permits to do so, without
    </p>
    <p>
     which they may not correspond. There are few books, and still fewer to
    </p>
    <p>
     read them; and these all in manuscript, for though the way to print is
    </p>
    <p>
     not lost, it is not employed since no one wants books.

    <p>
     THE LAKE
    </p>
    <p>
     There now only remains the geography of our country to be treated of
    </p>
    <p>
     before the history is commenced. Now the most striking difference
    </p>
    <p>
     between the country as we know it and as it was known to the ancients is
    </p>
    <p>
     the existence of the great Lake in the centre of the island. From the
    </p>
    <p>
     Red Rocks (by the Severn) hither, the most direct route a galley can
    </p>
    <p>
     follow is considered to be about 200 miles in length, and it is a
    </p>
    <p>
     journey which often takes a week even for a vessel well manned, because
    </p>
    <p>
     the course, as it turns round the islands, faces so many points of the
    </p>
    <p>
     compass, and therefore the oarsmen are sure to have to labour in the
    </p>
    <p>
     teeth of the wind, no matter which way it blows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many parts are still unexplored, and scarce anything known of their
    </p>
    <p>
     extent, even by repute. Until Felix Aquila's time, the greater portion,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, had not even a name. Each community was well acquainted with the
    </p>
    <p>
     bay before its own city, and with the route to the next, but beyond that
    </p>
    <p>
     they were ignorant, and had no desire to learn. Yet the Lake cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     really be so long and broad as it seems, for the country could not
    </p>
    <p>
     contain it. The length is increased, almost trebled, by the islands and
    </p>
    <p>
     shoals, which will not permit of navigation in a straight line. For the
    </p>
    <p>
     most part, too, they follow the southern shore of the mainland, which is
    </p>
    <p>
     protected by a fringe of islets and banks from the storms which sweep
    </p>
    <p>
     over the open waters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus rowing along round the gulfs and promontories, their voyage is
    </p>
    <p>
     thrice prolonged, but rendered nearly safe from the waves, which rise
    </p>
    <p>
     with incredible celerity before the gales. The slow ships of commerce,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, are often days in traversing the distance between one port and
    </p>
    <p>
     another, for they wait for the wind to blow abaft, and being heavy,
    </p>
    <p>
     deeply laden, built broad and flat-bottomed for shallows, and bluff at
    </p>
    <p>
     the bows, they drift like logs of timber. In canoes the hunters, indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes pass swiftly from one place to another, venturing farther out
    </p>
    <p>
     to sea than the ships. They could pass yet more quickly were it not for
    </p>
    <p>
     the inquisition of the authorities at every city and port, who not only
    </p>
    <p>
     levy dues and fees for the treasury of the prince, and for their own
    </p>
    <p>
     rapacious desires, but demand whence the vessel comes, to whom she
    </p>
    <p>
     belongs, and whither she is bound, so that no ship can travel rapidly
    </p>
    <p>
     unless so armed as to shake off these inquisitors.
    </p>
    <p>
     The canoes, therefore, travel at night and in calm weather many miles
    </p>
    <p>
     away from the shore, and thus escape, or slip by daylight among the
    </p>
    <p>
     reedy shallows, sheltered by the flags and willows from view. The ships
    </p>
    <p>
     of commerce haul up to the shore towards evening, and the crews,
    </p>
    <p>
     disembarking, light their fires and cook their food. There are, however,
    </p>
    <p>
     one or two gaps, as it were, in their usual course which they cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     pass in this leisurely manner; where the shore is exposed and rocky, or
    </p>
    <p>
     too shallow, and where they must reluctantly put forth, and sail from
    </p>
    <p>
     one horn of the land to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Lake is also divided into two unequal portions by the straits of
    </p>
    <p>
     White Horse, where vessels are often weather-bound, and cannot make way
    </p>
    <p>
     against the wind, which sets a current through the narrow channel. There
    </p>
    <p>
     is no tide; the sweet waters do not ebb and flow; but while I thus
    </p>
    <p>
     discourse, I have forgotten to state how they came to fill the middle of
    </p>
    <p>
     the country. Now, the philosopher Silvester, and those who seek after
    </p>
    <p>
     marvels, say that the passage of the dark body through space caused an
    </p>
    <p>
     immense volume of fresh water to fall in the shape of rain, and also
    </p>
    <p>
     that the growth of the forests distilled rain from the clouds. Let us
    </p>
    <p>
     leave these speculations to dreamers, and recount what is known to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     For there is no tradition among the common people, who are extremely
    </p>
    <p>
     tenacious of such things, of any great rainfall, nor is there any
    </p>
    <p>
     mention of floods in the ancient manuscripts, nor is there any larger
    </p>
    <p>
     fall of rain now than was formerly the case. But the Lake itself tells
    </p>
    <p>
     us how it was formed, or as nearly as we shall ever know, and these
    </p>
    <p>
     facts were established by the expeditions lately sent out.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the eastern extremity the Lake narrows, and finally is lost in the
    </p>
    <p>
     vast marshes which cover the site of the ancient London. Through these,
    </p>
    <p>
     no doubt, in the days of the old world there flowed the river Thames. By
    </p>
    <p>
     changes of the sea level and the sand that was brought up there must
    </p>
    <p>
     have grown great banks, which obstructed the stream. I have formerly
    </p>
    <p>
     mentioned the vast quantities of timber, the wreckage of towns and
    </p>
    <p>
     bridges which was carried down by the various rivers, and by none more
    </p>
    <p>
     so than by the Thames. These added to the accumulation, which increased
    </p>
    <p>
     the faster because the foundations of the ancient bridges held it like
    </p>
    <p>
     piles driven in for the purpose. And before this the river had become
    </p>
    <p>
     partially choked from the cloacæ of the ancient city which poured into
    </p>
    <p>
     it through enormous subterranean aqueducts and drains.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a time all these shallows and banks became well matted together by
    </p>
    <p>
     the growth of weeds, of willows, and flags, while the tide, ebbing lower
    </p>
    <p>
     at each drawing back, left still more mud and sand. Now it is believed
    </p>
    <p>
     that when this had gone on for a time, the waters of the river, unable
    </p>
    <p>
     to find a channel, began to overflow up into the deserted streets, and
    </p>
    <p>
     especially to fill the underground passages and drains, of which the
    </p>
    <p>
     number and extent was beyond all the power of words to describe. These,
    </p>
    <p>
     by the force of the water, were burst up, and the houses fell in.
    </p>
    <p>
     For this marvellous city, of which such legends are related, was after
    </p>
    <p>
     all only of brick, and when the ivy grew over and trees and shrubs
    </p>
    <p>
     sprang up, and, lastly, the waters underneath burst in, this huge
    </p>
    <p>
     metropolis was soon overthrown. At this day all those parts which were
    </p>
    <p>
     built upon low ground are marshes and swamps. Those houses that were
    </p>
    <p>
     upon high ground were, of course, like the other towns, ransacked of all
    </p>
    <p>
     they contained by the remnant that was left; the iron, too, was
    </p>
    <p>
     extracted. Trees growing up by them in time cracked the walls, and they
    </p>
    <p>
     fell in. Trees and bushes covered them; ivy and nettles concealed the
    </p>
    <p>
     crumbling masses of brick.
    </p>
    <p>
     The same was the case with the lesser cities and towns whose sites are
    </p>
    <p>
     known in the woods. For though many of our present towns bear the
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient names, they do not stand upon the ancient sites, but are two or
    </p>
    <p>
     three, and sometimes ten miles distant. The founders carried with them
    </p>
    <p>
     the name of their original residence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus the low-lying parts of the mighty city of London became swamps, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the higher grounds were clad with bushes. The very largest of the
    </p>
    <p>
     buildings fell in, and there was nothing visible but trees and hawthorns
    </p>
    <p>
     on the upper lands, and willows, flags, reeds, and rushes on the lower.
    </p>
    <p>
     These crumbling ruins still more choked the stream, and almost, if not
    </p>
    <p>
     quite, turned it back. If any water ooze past, it is not perceptible,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there is no channel through to the salt ocean. It is a vast stagnant
    </p>
    <p>
     swamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable
    </p>
    <p>
     fate.
    </p>
    <p>
     There exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapour that no animal can
    </p>
    <p>
     endure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which
    </p>
    <p>
     for ever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. When the wind
    </p>
    <p>
     collects the miasma, and, as it were, presses it together, it becomes
    </p>
    <p>
     visible as a low cloud which hangs over the place. The cloud does not
    </p>
    <p>
     advance beyond the limit of the marsh, seeming to stay there by some
    </p>
    <p>
     constant attraction; and well it is for us that it does not, since at
    </p>
    <p>
     such times when the vapour is thickest, the very wildfowl leave the
    </p>
    <p>
     reeds, and fly from the poison. There are no fishes, neither can eels
    </p>
    <p>
     exist in the mud, nor even newts. It is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     The flags and reeds are coated with slime and noisome to the touch;
    </p>
    <p>
     there is one place where even these do not grow, and where there is
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing but an oily liquid, green and rank. It is plain there are no
    </p>
    <p>
     fishes in the water, for herons do not go thither, nor the kingfishers,
    </p>
    <p>
     not one of which approaches the spot. They say the sun is sometimes
    </p>
    <p>
     hidden by the vapour when it is thickest, but I do not see how any can
    </p>
    <p>
     tell this, since they could not enter the cloud, as to breathe it when
    </p>
    <p>
     collected by the wind is immediately fatal. For all the rottenness of a
    </p>
    <p>
     thousand years and of many hundred millions of human beings is there
    </p>
    <p>
     festering under the stagnant water, which has sunk down into and
    </p>
    <p>
     penetrated the earth, and floated up to the surface the contents of the
    </p>
    <p>
     buried cloacæ.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many scores of men have, I fear, perished in the attempt to enter this
    </p>
    <p>
     fearful place, carried on by their desire of gain. For it can scarcely
    </p>
    <p>
     be disputed that untold treasures lie hidden therein, but guarded by
    </p>
    <p>
     terrors greater than fiery serpents. These have usually made their
    </p>
    <p>
     endeavours to enter in severe and continued frost, or in the height of a
    </p>
    <p>
     drought. Frost diminishes the power of the vapour, and the marshes can
    </p>
    <p>
     then, too, be partially traversed, for there is no channel for a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the moment anything be moved, whether it be a bush, or a willow,
    </p>
    <p>
     even a flag, if the ice be broken, the pestilence rises yet stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides which, there are portions which never freeze, and which may be
    </p>
    <p>
     approached unawares, or a turn of the wind may drift the gas towards the
    </p>
    <p>
     explorer.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the midst of summer, after long heat, the vapour rises, and is in a
    </p>
    <p>
     degree dissipated into the sky, and then by following devious ways an
    </p>
    <p>
     entrance may be effected, but always at the cost of illness. If the
    </p>
    <p>
     explorer be unable to quit the spot before night, whether in summer or
    </p>
    <p>
     winter, his death is certain. In the earlier times some bold and
    </p>
    <p>
     adventurous men did indeed succeed in getting a few jewels, but since
    </p>
    <p>
     then the marsh has become more dangerous, and its pestilent character,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, increases year by year, as the stagnant water penetrates deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     So that now for very many years no such attempts have been made.
    </p>
    <p>
     The extent of these foul swamps is not known with certainty, but it is
    </p>
    <p>
     generally believed that they are, at the widest, twenty miles across,
    </p>
    <p>
     and that they reach in a winding line for nearly forty. But the outside
    </p>
    <p>
     parts are much less fatal; it is only the interior which is avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
     Towards the Lake the sand thrown up by the waves has long since formed a
    </p>
    <p>
     partial barrier between the sweet water and the stagnant, rising up to
    </p>
    <p>
     within a few feet of the surface. This barrier is overgrown with flags
    </p>
    <p>
     and reeds, where it is shallow. Here it is possible to sail along the
    </p>
    <p>
     sweet water within an arrow-shot of the swamp. Nor, indeed, would the
    </p>
    <p>
     stagnant mingle with the sweet, as is evident at other parts of the
    </p>
    <p>
     swamp, where streams flow side by side with the dark or reddish water;
    </p>
    <p>
     and there are pools, upon one side of which the deer drink, while the
    </p>
    <p>
     other is not frequented even by rats.
    </p>
    <p>
     The common people aver that demons reside in these swamps; and, indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     at night fiery shapes are seen, which, to the ignorant, are sufficient
    </p>
    <p>
     confirmation of such tales. The vapour, where it is most dense, takes
    </p>
    <p>
     fire, like the blue flame of spirits, and these flaming clouds float to
    </p>
    <p>
     and fro, and yet do not burn the reeds. The superstitious trace in them
    </p>
    <p>
     the forms of demons and winged fiery serpents, and say that white
    </p>
    <p>
     spectres haunt the margin of the marsh after dusk. In a lesser degree,
    </p>
    <p>
     the same thing has taken place with other ancient cities. It is true
    </p>
    <p>
     that there are not always swamps, but the sites are uninhabitable
    </p>
    <p>
     because of the emanations from the ruins. Therefore they are avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the spot where a single house has been known to have existed, is
    </p>
    <p>
     avoided by the hunters in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     They say when they are stricken with ague or fever, that they must have
    </p>
    <p>
     unwittingly slept on the site of an ancient habitation. Nor can the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground be cultivated near the ancient towns, because it causes fever;
    </p>
    <p>
     and thus it is that, as I have already stated, the present places of the
    </p>
    <p>
     same name are often miles distant from the former locality. No sooner
    </p>
    <p>
     does the plough or the spade turn up an ancient site than those who work
    </p>
    <p>
     there are attacked with illness. And thus the cities of the old world,
    </p>
    <p>
     and their houses and habitations, are deserted and lost in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the hunters, about to pitch their camp for the night, should stumble
    </p>
    <p>
     on so much as a crumbling brick or a fragment of hewn stone, they at
    </p>
    <p>
     once remove at least a bowshot away.
    </p>
    <p>
     The eastward flow of the Thames being at first checked, and finally
    </p>
    <p>
     almost or quite stopped by the formation of these banks, the water
    </p>
    <p>
     turned backwards as it were, and began to cover hitherto dry land. And
    </p>
    <p>
     this, with the other lesser rivers and brooks that no longer had any
    </p>
    <p>
     ultimate outlet, accounts for the Lake, so far as this side of the
    </p>
    <p>
     country is concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the western extremity the waters also contract between the steep
    </p>
    <p>
     cliffs called the Red Rocks, near to which once existed the city of
    </p>
    <p>
     Bristol. Now the Welsh say, and the tradition of those who dwell in that
    </p>
    <p>
     part of the country bears them out, that in the time of the old world
    </p>
    <p>
     the River Severn flowed past the same spot, but not between these
    </p>
    <p>
     cliffs. The great river Severn coming down from the north, with England
    </p>
    <p>
     on one bank and Wales upon the other, entered the sea, widening out as
    </p>
    <p>
     it did so. Just before it reached the sea, another lesser river, called
    </p>
    <p>
     the Avon, the upper part of which is still there, joined it passing
    </p>
    <p>
     through this cleft in the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when the days of the old world ended in the twilight of the
    </p>
    <p>
     ancients, as the salt ocean fell back and its level became lower, vast
    </p>
    <p>
     sandbanks were disclosed, which presently extended across the most part
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Severn river. Others, indeed, think that the salt ocean did not
    </p>
    <p>
     sink, but that the land instead was lifted higher. Then they say that
    </p>
    <p>
     the waves threw up an immense quantity of shingle and sand, and that
    </p>
    <p>
     thus these banks were formed. All that we know with certainty, however,
    </p>
    <p>
     is, that across the estuary of the Severn there rose a broad barrier of
    </p>
    <p>
     beach, which grew wider with the years, and still increases westwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is as if the ocean churned up its floor and cast it forth upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     strand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now when the Severn was thus stayed yet more effectually than the
    </p>
    <p>
     Thames, in the first place it also flowed backwards as it were, till its
    </p>
    <p>
     overflow mingled with the reflux of the Thames. Thus the inland sea of
    </p>
    <p>
     fresh water was formed; though Silvester hints (what is most improbable)
    </p>
    <p>
     that the level of the land sank and formed a basin. After a time, when
    </p>
    <p>
     the waters had risen high enough, since all water must have an outlet
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhere, the Lake, passing over the green country behind the Red
    </p>
    <p>
     Rocks, came pouring through the channel of the Avon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, farther down, it rose over the banks which were lowest there, and
    </p>
    <p>
     thus found its way over a dam into the sea. Now when the tide of the
    </p>
    <p>
     ocean is at its ebb, the waters of the Lake rush over these banks with
    </p>
    <p>
     so furious a current that no vessel can either go down or come up. If
    </p>
    <p>
     they attempted to go down, they would be swamped by the meeting of the
    </p>
    <p>
     waves; if they attempted to come up, the strongest gale that blows could
    </p>
    <p>
     not force them against the stream. As the tide gradually returns,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, the level of the ocean rises to the level of the Lake, the
    </p>
    <p>
     outward flow of water ceases, and there is even a partial inward flow of
    </p>
    <p>
     the tide which, at its highest, reaches to the Red Rocks. At this state
    </p>
    <p>
     of the tide, which happens twice in a day and night, vessels can enter
    </p>
    <p>
     or go forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Irish ships, of which I have spoken, thus come into the Lake,
    </p>
    <p>
     waiting outside the bar till the tide lifts them over. The Irish ships,
    </p>
    <p>
     being built to traverse the ocean from their country, are large and
    </p>
    <p>
     stout and well manned, carrying from thirty to fifty men. The Welsh
    </p>
    <p>
     ships, which come down from that inlet of the Lake which follows the
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient course of the Severn, are much smaller and lighter, as not being
    </p>
    <p>
     required to withstand the heavy seas. They carry but fifteen or twenty
    </p>
    <p>
     men each, but then they are more numerous. The Irish ships, on account
    </p>
    <p>
     of their size and draught, in sailing about the sweet waters, cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     always haul on shore at night, nor follow the course of the ships of
    </p>
    <p>
     burden between the fringe of islands and the strand.
    </p>
    <p>
     They have often to stay in the outer and deeper waters; but the Welsh
    </p>
    <p>
     boats come in easily at all parts of the coast, so that no place is safe
    </p>
    <p>
     against them. The Welsh have ever been most jealous of the Severn, and
    </p>
    <p>
     will on no account permit so much as a canoe to enter it. So that
    </p>
    <p>
     whether it be a narrow creek, or whether there be wide reaches, or what
    </p>
    <p>
     the shores may be like, we are ignorant. And this is all that is with
    </p>
    <p>
     certainty known concerning the origin of the inland sea of sweet water,
    </p>
    <p>
     excluding all that superstition and speculation have advanced, and
    </p>
    <p>
     setting down nothing but ascertained facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     A beautiful sea it is, clear as crystal, exquisite to drink, abounding
    </p>
    <p>
     with fishes of every kind, and adorned with green islands. There is
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing more lovely in the world than when, upon a calm evening, the sun
    </p>
    <p>
     goes down across the level and gleaming water, where it is so wide that
    </p>
    <p>
     the eye can but just distinguish a low and dark cloud, as it were,
    </p>
    <p>
     resting upon the horizon, or perhaps, looking lengthways, cannot
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguish any ending to the expanse. Sometimes it is blue, reflecting
    </p>
    <p>
     the noonday sky; sometimes white from the clouds; again green and dark
    </p>
    <p>
     as the wind rises and the waves roll.
    </p>
    <p>
     Storms, indeed, come up with extraordinary swiftness, for which reason
    </p>
    <p>
     the ships, whenever possible, follow the trade route, as it is called,
    </p>
    <p>
     behind the islands, which shelter them like a protecting reef. They drop
    </p>
    <p>
     equally quickly, and thus it is not uncommon for the morning to be calm,
    </p>
    <p>
     the midday raging in waves dashing resistlessly upon the beach, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     evening still again. The Irish, who are accustomed to the salt ocean,
    </p>
    <p>
     say, in the suddenness of its storms and the shifting winds, it is more
    </p>
    <p>
     dangerous than the sea itself. But then there are almost always islands,
    </p>
    <p>
     behind which a vessel can be sheltered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beneath the surface of the Lake there must be concealed very many
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient towns and cities, of which the names are lost. Sometimes the
    </p>
    <p>
     anchors bring up even now fragments of rusty iron and old metal, or
    </p>
    <p>
     black beams of timber. It is said, and with probability, that when the
    </p>
    <p>
     remnant of the ancients found the water gradually encroaching (for it
    </p>
    <p>
     rose very slowly), as they were driven back year by year, they
    </p>
    <p>
     considered that in time they would be all swept away and drowned. But
    </p>
    <p>
     after extending to its present limits the Lake rose no farther, not even
    </p>
    <p>
     in the wettest seasons, but always remains the same. From the position
    </p>
    <p>
     of certain quays we know that it has thus remained for the last hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     years at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     Never, as I observed before, was there so beautiful an expanse of water.
    </p>
    <p>
     How much must we sorrow that it has so often proved only the easiest
    </p>
    <p>
     mode of bringing the miseries of war to the doors of the unoffending!
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet men are never weary of sailing to and fro upon it, and most of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cities of the present time are upon its shore. And in the evening we
    </p>
    <p>
     walk by the beach, and from the rising grounds look over the waters, as
    </p>
    <p>
     if to gaze upon their loveliness were reward to us for the labour of the
    </p>
    <p>
     day.

     CHAPTER I
    </head>
    <p>
     SIR FELIX
    </p>
    <p>
     On a bright May morning, the sunlight, at five o'clock, was pouring into
    </p>
    <p>
     a room which face the east at the ancestral home of the Aquilas. In this
    </p>
    <p>
     room Felix, the eldest of the three sons of the Baron, was sleeping. The
    </p>
    <p>
     beams passed over his head, and lit up a square space on the opposite
    </p>
    <p>
     whitewashed wall, where, in the midst of the brilliant light, hung an
    </p>
    <p>
     ivory cross. There were only two panes of glass in the window, each no
    </p>
    <p>
     more than two or three inches square, the rest of the window being
    </p>
    <p>
     closed by strong oaken shutters, thick enough to withstand the stroke of
    </p>
    <p>
     an arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the daytime one of these at least would have been thrown open to
    </p>
    <p>
     admit air and light. They did not quite meet, and a streak of sunshine,
    </p>
    <p>
     in addition to that which came through the tiny panes, entered at the
    </p>
    <p>
     chink. Only one window in the house contained more than two such panes
    </p>
    <p>
     (it was in the Baroness's sitting-room), and most of them had none at
    </p>
    <p>
     all. The glass left by the ancients in their dwellings had long since
    </p>
    <p>
     been used up or broken, and the fragments that remained were too
    </p>
    <p>
     precious to be put in ordinary rooms. When larger pieces were
    </p>
    <p>
     discovered, they were taken for the palaces of the princes, and even
    </p>
    <p>
     these were but sparingly supplied, so that the saying "he has glass in
    </p>
    <p>
     his window" was equivalent to "he belongs to the upper ranks".
    </p>
    <p>
     On the recess of the window was an inkstand, which had been recently in
    </p>
    <p>
     use, for a quill lay beside it, and a sheet of parchment partly covered
    </p>
    <p>
     with writing. The ink was thick and very dark, made of powdered
    </p>
    <p>
     charcoal, leaving a slightly raised writing, which could be perceived by
    </p>
    <p>
     the finger on rubbing it lightly over. Beneath the window on the bare
    </p>
    <p>
     floor was an open chest, in which were several similar parchments and
    </p>
    <p>
     books, and from which the sheet on the recess had evidently been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
     This chest, though small, was extremely heavy and strong, being dug out
    </p>
    <p>
     with the chisel and gouge from a solid block of oak. Except a few
    </p>
    <p>
     parallel grooves, there was no attempt at ornamentation upon it. The
    </p>
    <p>
     lid, which had no hinges, but lifted completely off, was tilted against
    </p>
    <p>
     the wall. It was, too, of oak some inches thick, and fitted upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     chest by a kind of dovetailing at the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of a lock, the chest was fastened by a lengthy thong of oxhide,
    </p>
    <p>
     which now lay in a coil on the floor. Bound round and round, twisted and
    </p>
    <p>
     intertangled, and finally tied with a special and secret knot (the ends
    </p>
    <p>
     being concealed), the thong of leather secured the contents of the chest
    </p>
    <p>
     from prying eyes or thievish hands. With axe or knife, of course, the
    </p>
    <p>
     knot might easily have been severed, but no one could obtain access to
    </p>
    <p>
     the room except the retainers of the house, and which of them, even if
    </p>
    <p>
     unfaithful, would dare to employ such means in view of the certain
    </p>
    <p>
     punishment that must follow? It would occupy hours to undo the knot, and
    </p>
    <p>
     then it could not be tied again in exactly the same fashion, so that the
    </p>
    <p>
     real use of the thong was to assure the owner that his treasures had not
    </p>
    <p>
     been interfered with in his absence. Such locks as were made were of the
    </p>
    <p>
     clumsiest construction. They were not so difficult to pick as the thong
    </p>
    <p>
     to untie, and their expense, or rather the difficulty of getting a
    </p>
    <p>
     workman who could manufacture them, confined their use to the heads of
    </p>
    <p>
     great houses. The Baron's chest was locked, and his alone, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides the parchments which were nearest the top, as most in use, there
    </p>
    <p>
     were three books, much worn and decayed, which had been preserved, more
    </p>
    <p>
     by accident than by care, from the libraries of the ancients. One was an
    </p>
    <p>
     abridged history of Rome, the other a similar account of English
    </p>
    <p>
     history, the third a primer of science or knowledge; all three, indeed,
    </p>
    <p>
     being books which, among the ancients, were used for teaching children,
    </p>
    <p>
     and which, by the men of those days, would have been cast aside with
    </p>
    <p>
     contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Exposed for years in decaying houses, rain and mildew had spotted and
    </p>
    <p>
     stained their pages; the covers had rotted away these hundred years, and
    </p>
    <p>
     were now supplied by a broad sheet of limp leather with wide margins far
    </p>
    <p>
     overlapping the edges; many of the pages were quite gone, and others
    </p>
    <p>
     torn by careless handling. The abridgment of Roman history had been
    </p>
    <p>
     scorched by a forest fire, and the charred edges of the leaves had
    </p>
    <p>
     dropped away in semicircular holes. Yet, by pondering over these, Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     had, as it were, reconstructed much of the knowledge which was the
    </p>
    <p>
     common (and therefore unvalued) possession of all when they were
    </p>
    <p>
     printed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The parchments contained his annotations, and the result of his thought;
    </p>
    <p>
     they were also full of extracts from decaying volumes lying totally
    </p>
    <p>
     neglected in the houses of other nobles. Most of these were of extreme
    </p>
    <p>
     antiquity, for when the ancients departed, the modern books which they
    </p>
    <p>
     had composed being left in the decaying houses at the mercy of the
    </p>
    <p>
     weather, rotted, or were destroyed by the frequent grass fires. But
    </p>
    <p>
     those that had been preserved by the ancients in museums escaped for a
    </p>
    <p>
     while, and some of these yet remained in lumber-rooms and corners,
    </p>
    <p>
     whence they were occasionally dragged forth by the servants for greater
    </p>
    <p>
     convenience in lighting the fires. The young nobles, entirely devoted to
    </p>
    <p>
     the chase, to love intrigues, and war, overwhelmed Felix Aquila with
    </p>
    <p>
     ridicule when they found him poring over these relics, and being of a
    </p>
    <p>
     proud and susceptible spirit, they so far succeeded that he abandoned
    </p>
    <p>
     the open pursuit of such studies, and stole his knowledge by fitful
    </p>
    <p>
     glances when there was no one near. As among the ancients learning was
    </p>
    <p>
     esteemed above all things, so now, by a species of contrast, it was of
    </p>
    <p>
     all things the most despised.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the books, in one corner of the chest, was a leather bag
    </p>
    <p>
     containing four golden sovereigns, such as were used by the ancients,
    </p>
    <p>
     and eighteen pieces of modern silver money, the debased shillings of the
    </p>
    <p>
     day, not much more than half of which was silver and the rest alloy. The
    </p>
    <p>
     gold coins had been found while digging holes for the posts of a new
    </p>
    <p>
     stockade, and by the law should have been delivered to the prince's
    </p>
    <p>
     treasury. All the gold discovered, whether in the form of coin or
    </p>
    <p>
     jewellery, was the property of the Prince, who was supposed to pay for
    </p>
    <p>
     its value in currency.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the actual value of the currency was only half of its nominal value
    </p>
    <p>
     (and sometimes less), the transaction was greatly in favour of the
    </p>
    <p>
     treasury. Such was the scarcity of gold that the law was strictly
    </p>
    <p>
     enforced, and had there been the least suspicion of the fact, the house
    </p>
    <p>
     would have been ransacked from the cellars to the roof. Imprisonment and
    </p>
    <p>
     fine would have been the inevitable fate of Felix, and the family would
    </p>
    <p>
     very probably have suffered for the fault of one of its members. But
    </p>
    <p>
     independent and determined to the last degree, Felix ran any risk rather
    </p>
    <p>
     than surrender that which he had found, and which he deemed his own.
    </p>
    <p>
     This unbending independence and pride of spirit, together with scarce
    </p>
    <p>
     concealed contempt for others, had resulted in almost isolating him from
    </p>
    <p>
     the youth of his own age, and had caused him to be regarded with dislike
    </p>
    <p>
     by the elders. He was rarely, if ever, asked to join the chase, and
    </p>
    <p>
     still more rarely invited to the festivities and amusements provided in
    </p>
    <p>
     adjacent houses, or to the grander entertainments of the higher nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Too quick to take offence where none was really intended, he fancied
    </p>
    <p>
     that many bore him ill-will who had scarcely given him a passing
    </p>
    <p>
     thought. He could not forgive the coarse jokes uttered upon his personal
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance by men of heavier build, who despised so slender a stripling.
    </p>
    <p>
     He would rather be alone than join their company, and would not compete
    </p>
    <p>
     with them in any of their sports, so that, when his absence from the
    </p>
    <p>
     arena was noticed, it was attributed to weakness or cowardice. These
    </p>
    <p>
     imputations stung him deeply, driving him to brood within himself. He
    </p>
    <p>
     was never seen in the courtyards or ante-rooms at the palace, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     following in the train of the Prince, as was the custom with the
    </p>
    <p>
     youthful nobles. The servility of the court angered and disgusted him;
    </p>
    <p>
     the eagerness of strong men to carry a cushion or fetch a dog annoyed
    </p>
    <p>
     him.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were those who observed this absence from the crowd in the
    </p>
    <p>
     ante-rooms. In the midst of so much intrigue and continual striving for
    </p>
    <p>
     power, designing men, on the one hand, were ever on the alert for what
    </p>
    <p>
     they imagined would prove willing instruments; and on the other, the
    </p>
    <p>
     Prince's councillors kept a watchful eye on the dispositions of every
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the least consequence; so that, although but twenty-five, Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     was already down in two lists, the one, at the palace, of persons whose
    </p>
    <p>
     views, if not treasonable, were doubtful, and the other, in the hands of
    </p>
    <p>
     a possible pretender, as a discontented and therefore useful man. Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     was entirely ignorant that he had attracted so much observation. He
    </p>
    <p>
     supposed himself simply despised and ignored; he cherished no treason,
    </p>
    <p>
     had not the slightest sympathy with any pretender, held totally aloof
    </p>
    <p>
     from intrigue, and his reveries, if they were ambitious, concerned only
    </p>
    <p>
     himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the most precious of the treasures in the chest were eight or ten
    </p>
    <p>
     small sheets of parchment, each daintily rolled and fastened with a
    </p>
    <p>
     ribbon, letters from Aurora Thyma, who had also given him the ivory
    </p>
    <p>
     cross on the wall. It was of ancient workmanship, a relic of the old
    </p>
    <p>
     world. A compass, a few small tools (valuable because preserved for so
    </p>
    <p>
     many years, and not now to be obtained for any consideration), and a
    </p>
    <p>
     magnifying glass, a relic also of the ancients, completed the contents
    </p>
    <p>
     of the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon a low table by the bedstead were a flint and steel and tinder, and
    </p>
    <p>
     an earthenware oil lamp, not intended to be carried about. There, too,
    </p>
    <p>
     lay his knife, with a buckhorn hilt, worn by everyone in the belt, and
    </p>
    <p>
     his forester's axe, a small tool, but extremely useful in the woods,
    </p>
    <p>
     without which, indeed, progress was often impossible. These were in the
    </p>
    <p>
     belt, which, as he undressed, he had cast upon the table, together with
    </p>
    <p>
     his purse, in which were about a dozen copper coins, not very regular in
    </p>
    <p>
     shape, and stamped on one side only. The table was formed of two short
    </p>
    <p>
     hewn planks, scarcely smoothed, raised on similar planks (on edge) at
    </p>
    <p>
     each end, in fact, a larger form.
    </p>
    <p>
     From a peg driven into the wall hung a disc of brass by a thin leathern
    </p>
    <p>
     lace; this disc, polished to the last degree, answered as a mirror. The
    </p>
    <p>
     only other piece of furniture, if so it could be called, was a block of
    </p>
    <p>
     wood at the side of the table, used as a chair. In the corner, between
    </p>
    <p>
     the table and the window, stood a long yew bow, and a quiver full of
    </p>
    <p>
     arrows ready for immediate use, besides which three or four sheaves lay
    </p>
    <p>
     on the floor. A crossbow hung on a wooden peg; the bow was of wood, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore, not very powerful; bolts and square-headed quarrels were
    </p>
    <p>
     scattered carelessly on the floor under it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Six or seven slender darts used for casting with the hand, as javelins,
    </p>
    <p>
     stood in another corner by the door, and two stouter boar spears. By the
    </p>
    <p>
     wall a heap of nets lay in apparent confusion, some used for partridges,
    </p>
    <p>
     some of coarse twine for bush-hens, another, lying a little apart, for
    </p>
    <p>
     fishes. Near these the component parts of two turkey-traps were strewn
    </p>
    <p>
     about, together with a small round shield or targe, such as are used by
    </p>
    <p>
     swordsmen, snares of wire, and, in an open box, several chisels, gouges,
    </p>
    <p>
     and other tools.
    </p>
    <p>
     A blowtube was fastened to three pegs, so that it might not warp, a
    </p>
    <p>
     hunter's horn hung from another, and on the floor were a number of
    </p>
    <p>
     arrows in various stages of manufacture, some tied to the straightening
    </p>
    <p>
     rod, some with the feathers already attached, and some hardly shaped
    </p>
    <p>
     from the elder or aspen log. A heap of skins filled the third corner,
    </p>
    <p>
     and beside them were numerous stag's horns, and two of the white cow,
    </p>
    <p>
     but none yet of the much dreaded and much desired white bull. A few
    </p>
    <p>
     peacock's feathers were there also, rare and difficult to get, and
    </p>
    <p>
     intended for Aurora. Round one footpost of the bed was a long coil of
    </p>
    <p>
     thin hide, a lasso, and on another was suspended an iron cap, or
    </p>
    <p>
     visorless helmet.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no sword or lance. Indeed, of all these weapons and
    </p>
    <p>
     implements, none seemed in use, to judge by the dust that had gathered
    </p>
    <p>
     upon them, and the rusted edges, except the bow and crossbow and one of
    </p>
    <p>
     the boar spears. The bed itself was very low, framed of wood, thick and
    </p>
    <p>
     solid; the clothes were of the coarsest linen and wool; there were furs
    </p>
    <p>
     for warmth in winter, but these were not required in May. There was no
    </p>
    <p>
     carpet, nor any substitute for it; the walls were whitewashed, ceiling
    </p>
    <p>
     there was none, the worm-eaten rafters were visible, and the roof tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     But on the table was a large earthenware bowl, full of meadow orchids,
    </p>
    <p>
     blue-bells, and a bunch of may in flower.
    </p>
    <p>
     His hat, wide in the brim, lay on the floor; his doublet was on the
    </p>
    <p>
     wooden block or seat, with the long tight-fitting trousers, which showed
    </p>
    <p>
     every muscle of the limb, and by them high shoes of tanned but unblacked
    </p>
    <p>
     leather. His short cloak hung on a wooden peg against the door, which
    </p>
    <p>
     was fastened with a broad bolt of oak. The parchment in the recess of
    </p>
    <p>
     the window at which he had been working just before retiring was covered
    </p>
    <p>
     with rough sketches, evidently sections of a design for a ship or galley
    </p>
    <p>
     propelled by oars.
    </p>
    <p>
     The square spot of light upon the wall slowly moved as the sun rose
    </p>
    <p>
     higher, till the ivory cross was left in shadow, but still the slumberer
    </p>
    <p>
     slept on, heedless, too, of the twittering of the swallows under the
    </p>
    <p>
     eaves, and the call of the cuckoo not far distant.

     CHAPTER II
    </head>
    <p>
     THE HOUSE OF AQUILA
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently there came the sound of a creaking axle, which grew louder and
    </p>
    <p>
     louder as the waggon drew nearer, till it approached a shriek. The
    </p>
    <p>
     sleeper moved uneasily, but recognising the noise even in his dreams,
    </p>
    <p>
     did not wake. The horrible sounds stopped; there was the sound of
    </p>
    <p>
     voices, as if two persons, one without and one within the wall, were
    </p>
    <p>
     hailing each other; a gate swung open, and the waggon came past under
    </p>
    <p>
     the very window of the bedroom. Even habit could not enable Felix to
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely withstand so piercing a noise when almost in his ears. He sat
    </p>
    <p>
     up a minute, and glanced at the square of light on the wall to guess the
    </p>
    <p>
     time by its position.
    </p>
    <p>
     In another minute or two the squeaking of the axle ceased, as the waggon
    </p>
    <p>
     reached the storehouses, and he immediately returned to the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without, and just beneath the window, there ran a road or way, which in
    </p>
    <p>
     part divided the enclosure into two portions; the dwelling-house and its
    </p>
    <p>
     offices being on one side, the granaries and storehouses on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     But a few yards to the left of his room, a strong gate in the enclosing
    </p>
    <p>
     wall gave entrance to this roadway. It was called the Maple Gate,
    </p>
    <p>
     because a small maple tree grew near outside. The wall, which surrounded
    </p>
    <p>
     the whole place at a distance of eight or ten yards from the buildings,
    </p>
    <p>
     was of brick, and about nine feet high, with a ditch without.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was partly embattled, and partly loopholed, and a banquette of earth
    </p>
    <p>
     rammed hard ran all round inside, so that the defenders might discharge
    </p>
    <p>
     darts or arrows through the embrasures, and step down out of sight to
    </p>
    <p>
     prepare a fresh supply. At each corner there was a large platform, where
    </p>
    <p>
     a considerable number of men could stand and command the approaches;
    </p>
    <p>
     there were, however, no bastions or flanking towers. On the roof of the
    </p>
    <p>
     dwelling-house a similar platform had been prepared, protected by a
    </p>
    <p>
     parapet; from which height the entire enclosure could be overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another platform, though at a less height, was on the roof of the
    </p>
    <p>
     retainers' lodgings, so placed as especially to command the second gate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Entering by the Maple Gate, the dwelling-house was on the right hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the granaries and general storehouses on the left, the latter built
    </p>
    <p>
     on three sides of a square. Farther on, on the same side, were the
    </p>
    <p>
     stables, and near them the forge and workshops. Beyond these, again,
    </p>
    <p>
     were the lodgings of the retainers and labourers, near which, in the
    </p>
    <p>
     corner, was the South Gate, from which the South Road led to the
    </p>
    <p>
     cattle-pens and farms, and out to the south.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon the right hand, after the dwelling-house, and connected with it,
    </p>
    <p>
     came the steward's stores, where the iron tools and similar valuable
    </p>
    <p>
     articles of metal were kept. Then, after a covered passage-way, the
    </p>
    <p>
     kitchen and general hall, under one roof with the house. The house
    </p>
    <p>
     fronted in the opposite direction to the roadway; there was a narrow
    </p>
    <p>
     green lawn between it and the enceinte, or wall, and before the general
    </p>
    <p>
     hall and kitchens a gravelled court. This was parted from the lawn by
    </p>
    <p>
     palings, so that the house folk enjoyed privacy, and yet were close to
    </p>
    <p>
     their servitors. The place was called the Old House, for it dated back
    </p>
    <p>
     to the time of the ancients, and the Aquilas were proud of the simple
    </p>
    <p>
     designation of their fortified residence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix's window was almost exactly opposite the entrance to the
    </p>
    <p>
     storehouse or granary yard, so that the waggon, after passing it, had to
    </p>
    <p>
     go but a little distance, and then, turning to the left, was drawn up
    </p>
    <p>
     before the doors of the warehouse. This waggon was low, built for the
    </p>
    <p>
     carriage of goods only, of hewn plank scarcely smooth, and the wheels
    </p>
    <p>
     were solid; cut, in fact, from the butt of an elm tree. Unless
    </p>
    <p>
     continually greased the squeaking of such wheels is terrible, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     carters frequently forgot their grease-horns.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much of the work of the farm, such as the carting of hay and corn in
    </p>
    <p>
     harvest-time, was done upon sleds; the waggons (there were but few of
    </p>
    <p>
     them) being reserved for longer journeys on the rough roads. This
    </p>
    <p>
     waggon, laden with wool, some of the season's clip, had come in four or
    </p>
    <p>
     five miles from an out-lying cot, or sheep-pen, at the foot of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hills. In the buildings round the granary yard there were stored not
    </p>
    <p>
     only the corn and flour required for the retainers (who might at any
    </p>
    <p>
     moment become a besieged garrison), but the most valuable products of
    </p>
    <p>
     the estate, the wool, hides, and tanned leather from the tan-pits,
    </p>
    <p>
     besides a great quantity of bacon and salt beef; indeed, every possible
    </p>
    <p>
     article that could be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     These buildings were put together with wooden pins, on account of the
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcity of iron, and were all (dwelling-houses included) roofed with
    </p>
    <p>
     red tile. Lesser houses, cottages, and sheds at a distance were
    </p>
    <p>
     thatched, but in an enclosure tiles were necessary, lest, in case of an
    </p>
    <p>
     attack, fire should be thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
     Half an hour later, at six o'clock, the watchman blew his horn as loudly
    </p>
    <p>
     as possible for some two or three minutes, the hollow sound echoing
    </p>
    <p>
     through the place. He took the time by the sundial on the wall, it being
    </p>
    <p>
     a summer morning; in winter he was guided by the position of the stars,
    </p>
    <p>
     and often, when sun or stars were obscured, went by guess. The house
    </p>
    <p>
     horn was blown thrice a day; at six in the morning, as a signal that the
    </p>
    <p>
     day had begun, at noon as a signal for dinner, at six in the afternoon
    </p>
    <p>
     as a signal that the day (except in harvest-time) was over. The watchmen
    </p>
    <p>
     went their round about the enclosure all night long, relieved every
    </p>
    <p>
     three hours, armed with spears, and attended by mastiffs. By day one
    </p>
    <p>
     sufficed, and his station was then usually (though not always) on the
    </p>
    <p>
     highest part of the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
     The horn re-awoke Felix; it was the note by which he had been accustomed
    </p>
    <p>
     to rise for years. He threw open the oaken shutters, and the sunlight
    </p>
    <p>
     and the fresh breeze of the May morning came freely into the room. There
    </p>
    <p>
     was now the buzz of voices without, men unloading the wool, men at the
    </p>
    <p>
     workshops and in the granaries, and others waiting at the door of the
    </p>
    <p>
     steward's store for the tools, which he handed out to them. Iron being
    </p>
    <p>
     so scarce, tools were a temptation, and were carefully locked up each
    </p>
    <p>
     night, and given out again in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix went to the ivory cross and kissed it in affectionate recollection
    </p>
    <p>
     of Aurora, and then looked towards the open window, in the pride and joy
    </p>
    <p>
     of youth turning to the East, the morning, and the light. Before he had
    </p>
    <p>
     half dressed there came a knock and then an impatient kick at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     He unbarred it, and his brother Oliver entered. Oliver had been for his
    </p>
    <p>
     swim in the river. He excelled in swimming, as, indeed, in every manly
    </p>
    <p>
     exercise, being as active and energetic as Felix was outwardly languid.
    </p>
    <p>
     His room was only across the landing, his door just opposite. It also
    </p>
    <p>
     was strewn with implements and weapons. But there was a far greater
    </p>
    <p>
     number of tools; he was an expert and artistic workman, and his table
    </p>
    <p>
     and his seat, unlike the rude blocks in Felix's room, were tastefully
    </p>
    <p>
     carved. His seat, too, had a back, and he had even a couch of his own
    </p>
    <p>
     construction. By his bedhead hung his sword, his most valued and most
    </p>
    <p>
     valuable possession. It was one which had escaped the dispersion of the
    </p>
    <p>
     ancients; it had been ancient even in their days, and of far better work
    </p>
    <p>
     than they themselves produced.
    </p>
    <p>
     Broad, long, straight, and well-balanced, it appeared capable of cutting
    </p>
    <p>
     through helmet and mail, when wielded by Oliver's sturdy arm. Such a
    </p>
    <p>
     sword could not have been purchased for money; money, indeed, had often
    </p>
    <p>
     been offered for it in vain; persuasion, and even covert threats from
    </p>
    <p>
     those higher in authority who coveted it, were alike wasted. The sword
    </p>
    <p>
     had been in the family for generations, and when the Baron grew too old,
    </p>
    <p>
     or rather when he turned away from active life, the second son claimed
    </p>
    <p>
     it as the fittest to use it. The claim was tacitly allowed; at all
    </p>
    <p>
     events, he had it, and meant to keep it.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a corner stood his lance, long and sharp, for use on horse-back, and
    </p>
    <p>
     by it his saddle and accoutrements. The helmet and the shirt of mail,
    </p>
    <p>
     the iron greaves and spurs, the short iron mace to bang at the
    </p>
    <p>
     saddle-bow, spoke of the knight, the man of horses and war.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver's whole delight was in exercise and sport. The boldest rider, the
    </p>
    <p>
     best swimmer, the best at leaping, at hurling the dart or the heavy
    </p>
    <p>
     hammer, ever ready for tilt or tournament, his whole life was spent with
    </p>
    <p>
     horse, sword, and lance. A year younger than Felix, he was at least ten
    </p>
    <p>
     years physically older. He measured several inches more round the chest;
    </p>
    <p>
     his massive shoulders and immense arms, brown and hairy, his powerful
    </p>
    <p>
     limbs, tower-like neck, and somewhat square jaw were the natural
    </p>
    <p>
     concomitants of enormous physical strength.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the blood and bone and thew and sinew of the house seemed to have
    </p>
    <p>
     fallen to his share; all the fiery, restless spirit and defiant temper;
    </p>
    <p>
     all the utter recklessness and warrior's instinct. He stood every inch a
    </p>
    <p>
     man, with dark, curling, short-cut hair, brown cheek and Roman chin,
    </p>
    <p>
     trimmed moustache, brown eye, shaded by long eyelashes and well-marked
    </p>
    <p>
     brows; every inch a natural king of men. That very physical
    </p>
    <p>
     preponderance and animal beauty was perhaps his bane, for his comrades
    </p>
    <p>
     were so many, and his love adventures so innumerable, that they left him
    </p>
    <p>
     no time for serious ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Between the brothers there was the strangest mixture of affection and
    </p>
    <p>
     repulsion. The elder smiled at the excitement and energy of the younger;
    </p>
    <p>
     the younger openly despised the studious habits and solitary life of the
    </p>
    <p>
     elder. In time of real trouble and difficulty they would have been drawn
    </p>
    <p>
     together; as it was, there was little communion; the one went his way,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the other his. There was perhaps rather an inclination to detract
    </p>
    <p>
     from each other's achievements that to praise them, a species of
    </p>
    <p>
     jealousy or envy without personal dislike, if that can be understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were good friends, and yet kept apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver made friends of all, and thwacked and banged his enemies into
    </p>
    <p>
     respectful silence. Felix made friends of none, and was equally despised
    </p>
    <p>
     by nominal friends and actual enemies. Oliver was open and jovial; Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     reserved and contemptuous, or sarcastic in manner. His slender frame,
    </p>
    <p>
     too tall for his width, was against him; he could neither lift the
    </p>
    <p>
     weights nor undergo the muscular strain readily borne by Oliver. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     easy to see that Felix, although nominally the eldest, had not yet
    </p>
    <p>
     reached his full development. A light complexion, fair hair and eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     were also against him; where Oliver made conquests, Felix was
    </p>
    <p>
     unregarded. He laughed, but perhaps his secret pride was hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was but one thing Felix could do in the way of exercise and sport.
    </p>
    <p>
     He could shoot with the bow in a manner till then entirely unapproached.
    </p>
    <p>
     His arrows fell unerringly in the centre of the target, the swift deer
    </p>
    <p>
     and the hare were struck down with ease, and even the wood-pigeon in
    </p>
    <p>
     full flight. Nothing was safe from those terrible arrows. For this, and
    </p>
    <p>
     this only, his fame had gone forth; and even this was made a source of
    </p>
    <p>
     bitterness to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The nobles thought no arms worthy of men of descent but the sword and
    </p>
    <p>
     lance; missile weapons, as the dart and arrow, were the arms of
    </p>
    <p>
     retainers. His degradation was completed when, at a tournament, where he
    </p>
    <p>
     had mingled with the crowd, the Prince sent for him to shoot at the
    </p>
    <p>
     butt, and display his skill among the soldiery, instead of with the
    </p>
    <p>
     knights in the tilting ring. Felix shot, indeed, but shut his eyes that
    </p>
    <p>
     the arrow might go wide, and was jeered at as a failure even in that
    </p>
    <p>
     ignoble competition. Only by an iron self-control did he refrain that
    </p>
    <p>
     day from planting one of the despised shafts in the Prince's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when Oliver joked him about his failure, Felix asked him to hang up
    </p>
    <p>
     his breastplate at two hundred yards. He did so, and in an instant a
    </p>
    <p>
     shaft was sent through it. After that Oliver held his peace, and in his
    </p>
    <p>
     heart began to think that the bow was a dangerous weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So you are late again this morning," said Oliver, leaning against the
    </p>
    <p>
     recess of the window, and placing his arms on it. The sunshine fell on
    </p>
    <p>
     his curly dark hair, still wet from the river. "Studying last night, I
    </p>
    <p>
     suppose?" turning over the parchment. "Why didn't you ride into town
    </p>
    <p>
     with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "The water must have been cold this morning?" said Felix, ignoring the
    </p>
    <p>
     question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes; there was a slight frost, or something like it, very early, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     mist on the surface; but it was splendid in the pool. Why don't you get
    </p>
    <p>
     up and come? You used to."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can swim," said Felix laconically, implying that, having learnt the
    </p>
    <p>
     art, it no more tempted him. "You were late last night. I heard you put
    </p>
    <p>
     Night in."
    </p>
    <p>
     "We came home in style; it was rather dusky, but Night galloped the
    </p>
    <p>
     Green Miles."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mind she doesn't put her hoof in a rabbit's hole, some night."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not that. She can see like a cat. I believe we got over the twelve
    </p>
    <p>
     miles in less than an hour. Sharp work, considering the hills. You don't
    </p>
    <p>
     inquire for the news."
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's the news to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, there was a quarrel at the palace yesterday afternoon. The Prince
    </p>
    <p>
     told Louis he was a double-faced traitor, and Louis told the Prince he
    </p>
    <p>
     was a suspicious fool. It nearly came to blows, and Louis is banished."
    </p>
    <p>
     "For the fiftieth time."
    </p>
    <p>
     "This time it is more serious."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't believe it. He will be sent for again this morning; cannot you
    </p>
    <p>
     see why?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No."
    </p>
    <p>
     "If the Prince is really suspicious, he will never send his brother into
    </p>
    <p>
     the country, where he might be resorted to by discontented people. He
    </p>
    <p>
     will keep him close at hand."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wish the quarrelling would cease; it spoils half the fun; one's
    </p>
    <p>
     obliged to creep about the court and speak in whispers, and you can't
    </p>
    <p>
     tell whom you are talking to; they may turn on you if you say too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no dancing either. I hate this moody state. I wish they would
    </p>
    <p>
     either dance or fight."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fight! who?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anybody. There's some more news, but you don't care."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No. I do not."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why don't you go and live in the woods all by yourself?" said Oliver,
    </p>
    <p>
     in some heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me your news. I am listening."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The Irish landed at Blacklands the day before yesterday, and burnt
    </p>
    <p>
     Robert's place; they tried Letburn, but the people there had been
    </p>
    <p>
     warned, and were ready. And there's an envoy from Sypolis arrived; some
    </p>
    <p>
     think the Assembly has broken up; they were all at daggers drawn. So
    </p>
    <p>
     much for the Holy League."
    </p>
    <p>
     "So much for the Holy League," repeated Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What are you going to do to-day?" asked Oliver, after awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am going down to my canoe," said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will go with you; the trout are rising. Have you got any hooks?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's some in the box there, I think; take the tools out."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver searched among the tools in the open box, all rusty and covered
    </p>
    <p>
     with dust, while Felix finished dressing, put away his parchment, and
    </p>
    <p>
     knotted the thong round his chest. He found some hooks at the bottom,
    </p>
    <p>
     and after breakfast they walked out together, Oliver carrying his rod,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a boar-spear, and Felix a boar-spear also, in addition to a small
    </p>
    <p>
     flag basket with some chisels and gouges.

     CHAPTER III
    </head>
    <p>
     THE STOCKADE
    </p>
    <p>
     When Oliver and Felix started, they left Philip, the third and youngest
    </p>
    <p>
     of the three brothers, still at breakfast. They turned to the left, on
    </p>
    <p>
     getting out of doors, and again to the left, through the covered passage
    </p>
    <p>
     between the steward's store and the kitchen. Then crossing the waggon
    </p>
    <p>
     yard, they paused a moment to glance in at the forge, where two men were
    </p>
    <p>
     repairing part of a plough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver must also look for a moment at his mare, after which they
    </p>
    <p>
     directed their steps to the South Gate. The massive oaken door was open,
    </p>
    <p>
     the bolts having been drawn back at hornblow. There was a guard-room on
    </p>
    <p>
     one side of the gate under the platform in the corner, where there was
    </p>
    <p>
     always supposed to be a watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     But in times of peace, and when there were no apprehensions of attack,
    </p>
    <p>
     the men whose turn it was to watch there were often called away for a
    </p>
    <p>
     time to assist in some labour going forward, and at that moment were
    </p>
    <p>
     helping to move the woolpacks farther into the warehouse. Still they
    </p>
    <p>
     were close at hand, and had the day watchman or warder, who was now on
    </p>
    <p>
     the roof, blown his horn, would have rushed direct to the gate. Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     did not like this relaxation of discipline. His precise ideas were upset
    </p>
    <p>
     at the absence of the guard; method, organization, and precision, were
    </p>
    <p>
     the characteristics of his mind, and this kind of uncertainty irritated
    </p>
    <p>
     him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wish Sir Constans would insist on the guard being kept," he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Children, in speaking of their parents, invariably gave them their
    </p>
    <p>
     titles. Now their father's title was properly "my lord," as he was a
    </p>
    <p>
     baron, and one of the most ancient. But he had so long abnegated the
    </p>
    <p>
     exercise of his rights and privileges, sinking the noble in the
    </p>
    <p>
     mechanician, that men had forgotten the proper style in which they
    </p>
    <p>
     should address him. "Sir" was applied to all nobles, whether they
    </p>
    <p>
     possessed estates or not. The brothers were invariably addressed as Sir
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix or Sir Oliver. It marked, therefore, the low estimation in which
    </p>
    <p>
     the Baron was held when even his own sons spoke of him by that title.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver, though a military man by profession, laughed at Felix's strict
    </p>
    <p>
     view of the guards' duties. Familiarity with danger, and natural
    </p>
    <p>
     carelessness, had rendered him contemptuous of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's no risk," said he, "that I can see. Who could attack us? The
    </p>
    <p>
     Bushmen would never dream of it; the Romany would be seen coming days
    </p>
    <p>
     beforehand; we are too far from the Lake for the pirates; and as we are
    </p>
    <p>
     not great people, as we might have been, we need dread no private
    </p>
    <p>
     enmity. Besides which, any assailants must pass the stockades first."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quite true. Still I don't like it; it is a loose way of doing things."
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside the gate they followed the waggon track, or South Road, for
    </p>
    <p>
     about half a mile. It crossed meadows parted by low hedges, and they
    </p>
    <p>
     remarked, as they went, on the shortness of the grass, which, for want
    </p>
    <p>
     of rain, was not nearly fit for mowing. Last year there had been a bad
    </p>
    <p>
     wheat crop; this year there was at present scarcely any grass. These
    </p>
    <p>
     matters were of the highest importance; peace or war, famine or plenty,
    </p>
    <p>
     might depend upon the weather of the next few months.
    </p>
    <p>
     The meadows, besides being divided by the hedges, kept purposely cropped
    </p>
    <p>
     low, were surrounded, like all the cultivated lands, by high and strong
    </p>
    <p>
     stockades. Half a mile down the South Road they left the track, and
    </p>
    <p>
     following a footpath some few hundred yards, came to the pool where
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver had bathed that morning. The river, which ran through the
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosed grounds, was very shallow, for they were near its source in the
    </p>
    <p>
     hills, but just there it widened, and filled a depression fifty or sixty
    </p>
    <p>
     yards across, which was deep enough for swimming. Beyond the pool the
    </p>
    <p>
     stream curved and left the enclosure; the stockade, or at least an open
    </p>
    <p>
     work of poles, was continued across it. This work permitted the stream
    </p>
    <p>
     to flow freely, but was sufficiently close to exclude any one who might
    </p>
    <p>
     attempt to enter by creeping up the bed of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
     They crossed the river just above the pool by some stepping-stones,
    </p>
    <p>
     large blocks rolled in for the purpose, and approached the stockade. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was formed of small but entire trees, young elms, firs, or very thick
    </p>
    <p>
     ash-poles, driven in a double row into the earth, the first or inner row
    </p>
    <p>
     side by side, the outer row filling the interstices, and the whole bound
    </p>
    <p>
     together at the bottom by split willow woven in and out. This
    </p>
    <p>
     interweaving extended only about three feet up, and was intended first
    </p>
    <p>
     to bind the structure together, and secondly to exclude small animals
    </p>
    <p>
     which might creep in between the stakes. The reason it was not carried
    </p>
    <p>
     all up was that it should not afford a footing to human thieves desirous
    </p>
    <p>
     of climbing over.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smooth poles by themselves afforded no notch or foothold for a
    </p>
    <p>
     Bushman's naked foot. They rose nine or ten feet above the willow, so
    </p>
    <p>
     that the total height of the palisade was about twelve feet, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     tops of the stakes were sharpened. The construction of such palisades
    </p>
    <p>
     required great labour, and could be carried out only by those who could
    </p>
    <p>
     command the services of numbers of men, so that a small proprietor was
    </p>
    <p>
     impossible, unless within the walls of a town. This particular stockade
    </p>
    <p>
     was by no means an extensive one, in comparison with the estates of more
    </p>
    <p>
     prominent nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
     The enclosure immediately surrounding the Old House was of an irregular
    </p>
    <p>
     oval shape, perhaps a mile long, and not quite three-quarters of a mile
    </p>
    <p>
     wide, the house being situated towards the northern and higher end of
    </p>
    <p>
     the oval. The river crossed it, entering on the west and leaving on the
    </p>
    <p>
     eastern side. The enclosure was for the greater part meadow and pasture,
    </p>
    <p>
     for here the cattle were kept, which supplied the house with milk,
    </p>
    <p>
     cheese, and butter, while others intended for slaughter were driven in
    </p>
    <p>
     here for the last months of fattening.
    </p>
    <p>
     The horses in actual use for riding, or for the waggons, were also
    </p>
    <p>
     turned out here temporarily. There were two pens and rickyards within
    </p>
    <p>
     it, one beside the river, one farther down. The South Road ran almost
    </p>
    <p>
     down the centre, passing both rickyards, and leaving the stockade at the
    </p>
    <p>
     southern end by a gate, called the barrier. At the northern extremity of
    </p>
    <p>
     the oval the palisade passed within three hundred yards of the house,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there was another barrier, to which the road led from the Maple
    </p>
    <p>
     Gate, which has been mentioned. From thence it went across the hills to
    </p>
    <p>
     the town of Ponze. Thus, anyone approaching the Old House had first to
    </p>
    <p>
     pass the barrier and get inside the palisade.
    </p>
    <p>
     At each barrier there was a cottage and a guard-room, though, as a
    </p>
    <p>
     matter of fact, the watch was kept in peaceful times even more
    </p>
    <p>
     carelessly than at the inner gates of the wall about the House itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much the same plan, with local variations, was pursued on the other
    </p>
    <p>
     estates of the province, though the stockade at the Old House was
    </p>
    <p>
     remarkable for the care and skill with which it had been constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part of the duty of the watchman on the roof was to keep an eye on the
    </p>
    <p>
     barriers, which he could see from his elevated position.
    </p>
    <p>
     In case of an incursion of gipsies, or any danger, the guard at the
    </p>
    <p>
     barrier was supposed to at once close the gate, blow a horn, and exhibit
    </p>
    <p>
     a flag. Upon hearing the horn or observing the flag, the warder on the
    </p>
    <p>
     roof raised the alarm, and assistance was sent. Such was the system, but
    </p>
    <p>
     as no attack had taken place for some years the discipline had grown
    </p>
    <p>
     lax.
    </p>
    <p>
     After crossing on the stepping-stones Oliver and Felix were soon under
    </p>
    <p>
     the stockade which ran high above them, and was apparently as difficult
    </p>
    <p>
     to get out of as to get into. By the strict law of the estate, any
    </p>
    <p>
     person who left the stockade except by the public barrier rendered
    </p>
    <p>
     himself liable to the lash or imprisonment. Any person, even a retainer,
    </p>
    <p>
     endeavouring to enter from without by pole, ladder, or rope, might be
    </p>
    <p>
     killed with an arrow or dart, putting himself into the position of an
    </p>
    <p>
     outlaw. In practice, of course, this law was frequently evaded. It did
    </p>
    <p>
     not apply to the family of the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under some bushes by the palisade was a ladder of rope, the rungs,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, of wood. Putting his fishing-tackle and boar spear down, Oliver
    </p>
    <p>
     took the ladder and threw the end over the stockade. He then picked up a
    </p>
    <p>
     pole with a fork at the end from the bushes, left there, of course, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the purpose, and with the fork pushed the rungs over till the ladder was
    </p>
    <p>
     adjusted, half within and half without the palisade. It hung by the
    </p>
    <p>
     wooden rungs which caught the tops of the stakes. He then went up, and
    </p>
    <p>
     when at the top, leant over and drew up the outer part of the ladder one
    </p>
    <p>
     rung, which he put the inner side of the palisade, so that on
    </p>
    <p>
     transferring his weight to the outer side it might uphold him. Otherwise
    </p>
    <p>
     the ladder, when he got over the points of the stakes, must have slipped
    </p>
    <p>
     the distance between one rung and a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having adjusted this, he got over, and Felix carrying up the spears and
    </p>
    <p>
     tackle handed them to him. Felix followed, and thus in three minutes
    </p>
    <p>
     they were on the outer side of the stockade. Originally the ground for
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty yards, all round outside the stockade, had been cleared of trees
    </p>
    <p>
     and bushes that they might not harbour vermin, or thorn-hogs, or
    </p>
    <p>
     facilitate the approach of human enemies. Part of the weekly work of the
    </p>
    <p>
     bailiffs was to walk round the entire circumference of the stockade to
    </p>
    <p>
     see that it was in order, and to have any bushes removed that began to
    </p>
    <p>
     grow up. As with other matters, however, in the lapse of time the
    </p>
    <p>
     bailiffs became remiss, and under the easy, and perhaps too merciful
    </p>
    <p>
     rule of Sir Constans, were not recalled to their duties with sufficient
    </p>
    <p>
     sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brambles and thorns and other underwood had begun to cover the space
    </p>
    <p>
     that should have been open, and young sapling oaks had risen from
    </p>
    <p>
     dropped acorns. Felix pointed this out to Oliver, who seldom accompanied
    </p>
    <p>
     him; he was indeed rather glad of the opportunity to do so, as Oliver
    </p>
    <p>
     had more interest with Sir Constans than himself. Oliver admitted it
    </p>
    <p>
     showed great negligence, but added that after all it really did not
    </p>
    <p>
     matter. "What I wish," said he, "is that Sir Constans would go to Court,
    </p>
    <p>
     and take his proper position."
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this they were well agreed; it was, in fact, almost the only point
    </p>
    <p>
     upon which all three brothers did agree. They sometimes talked about it
    </p>
    <p>
     till they separated in a furious temper, not with each other but with
    </p>
    <p>
     him. There was a distinct track of footsteps through the narrow band of
    </p>
    <p>
     low brambles and underwood between the stockade and the forest. This had
    </p>
    <p>
     been made by Felix in his daily visits to his canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     The forest there consisted principally of hawthorn-trees and thorn
    </p>
    <p>
     thickets, with some scattered oaks and ashes; the timber was sparse, but
    </p>
    <p>
     the fern was now fast rising up so thick, that in the height of summer
    </p>
    <p>
     it would be difficult to walk through it. The tips of the fronds
    </p>
    <p>
     unrolling were now not up to the knee; then the brake would reach to the
    </p>
    <p>
     shoulder. The path wound round the thickets (the blackthorn being quite
    </p>
    <p>
     impenetrable except with the axe) and came again to the river some four
    </p>
    <p>
     or five hundred yards from the stockade. The stream, which ran from west
    </p>
    <p>
     to east through the enclosure, here turned and went due south.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the bank Felix had found a fine black poplar, the largest and
    </p>
    <p>
     straightest and best grown of that sort for some distance round, and
    </p>
    <p>
     this he had selected for his canoe. Stones broke the current here into
    </p>
    <p>
     eddies, below which there were deep holes and gullies where alders hung
    </p>
    <p>
     over, and an ever-rustling aspen spread the shadow of its boughs across
    </p>
    <p>
     the water. The light-coloured mud, formed of disintegrated chalk, on the
    </p>
    <p>
     farther and shallower side was only partly hidden by flags and sedges,
    </p>
    <p>
     which like a richer and more alluvial earth. Nor did the bushes grow
    </p>
    <p>
     very densely on this soil over the chalk, so that there was more room
    </p>
    <p>
     for casting the fly than is usually the case where a stream runs through
    </p>
    <p>
     a forest. Oliver, after getting his tackle in order, at once began to
    </p>
    <p>
     cast, while Felix, hanging his doublet on an oft-used branch, and
    </p>
    <p>
     leaning his spear against a tree, took his chisels and gouge from the
    </p>
    <p>
     flag basket.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had chosen the black poplar for the canoe because it was the lightest
    </p>
    <p>
     wood, and would float best. To fell so large a tree had been a great
    </p>
    <p>
     labour, for the axes were of poor quality, cut badly, and often required
    </p>
    <p>
     sharpening. He could easily have ordered half-a-dozen men to throw the
    </p>
    <p>
     tree, and they would have obeyed immediately; but then the individuality
    </p>
    <p>
     and interest of the work would have been lost. Unless he did it himself
    </p>
    <p>
     its importance and value to him would have been diminished. It had now
    </p>
    <p>
     been down some weeks, had been hewn into outward shape, and the larger
    </p>
    <p>
     part of the interior slowly dug away with chisel and gouge.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had commenced while the hawthorn was just putting forth its first
    </p>
    <p>
     spray, when the thickets and the trees were yet bare. Now the May bloom
    </p>
    <p>
     scented the air, the forest was green, and his work approached
    </p>
    <p>
     completion. There remained, indeed, but some final shaping and rounding
    </p>
    <p>
     off, and the construction, or rather cutting out, of a secret locker in
    </p>
    <p>
     the stern. This locker was nothing more than a square aperture chiselled
    </p>
    <p>
     out like a mortice, entering not from above but parallel with the
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom, and was to be closed with a tight-fitting piece of wood driven
    </p>
    <p>
     in by force of mallet.
    </p>
    <p>
     A little paint would then conceal the slight chinks, and the boat might
    </p>
    <p>
     be examined in every possible way without any trace of this hiding-place
    </p>
    <p>
     being observed. The canoe was some eleven feet long, and nearly three
    </p>
    <p>
     feet in the beam; it tapered at either end, so that it might be
    </p>
    <p>
     propelled backwards or forwards without turning, and stem and stern
    </p>
    <p>
     (interchangeable definitions in this case) each rose a few inches higher
    </p>
    <p>
     than the general gunwale. The sides were about two inches thick, the
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom three, so that although dug out from light wood the canoe was
    </p>
    <p>
     rather heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first Felix constructed a light shed of fir poles roofed with
    </p>
    <p>
     spruce-fir branches over the log, so that he might work sheltered from
    </p>
    <p>
     the bitter winds of the early spring. As the warmth increased he had
    </p>
    <p>
     taken the shed down, and now as the sun rose higher was glad of the
    </p>
    <p>
     shade of an adjacent beech.

    <p>
     THE CANOE
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix had scarcely worked half an hour before Oliver returned and threw
    </p>
    <p>
     himself on the ground at full length. He had wearied of fishing, the
    </p>
    <p>
     delicate adjustment of the tackle and the care necessary to keep the
    </p>
    <p>
     hook and line from catching in the branches had quickly proved too much
    </p>
    <p>
     for his patience. He lay on the grass, his feet towards the stream which
    </p>
    <p>
     ran and bubbled beneath, and watched Felix chipping out the block
    </p>
    <p>
     intended to fit into the secret opening or locker.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is it nearly finished, then?" he said presently. "What a time you have
    </p>
    <p>
     been at it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nearly three months."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why did you make it so big? It is too big."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is it really? Perhaps I want to put some things in it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I see; cargo. But where are you going to launch it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Below the stones there."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, you won't be able to go far; there's an old fir across the river
    </p>
    <p>
     down yonder, and a hollow willow has fallen in. Besides, the stream's
    </p>
    <p>
     too shallow; you'll take ground before you get half a mile."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shall I?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course you will. That boat will float six inches deep by herself,
    </p>
    <p>
     and I'm sure there's not six inches by the Thorns."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very awkward."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why didn't you have a hide boat made, with a willow framework and
    </p>
    <p>
     leather cover? Then you might perhaps get down the river by hauling it
    </p>
    <p>
     past the shallows and the fallen trees. In two days' time you would be
    </p>
    <p>
     in the hands of the gipsies."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you would be Sir Constans' heir!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, come, I say; that's too bad. You know I didn't mean that. Besides,
    </p>
    <p>
     I think I'm as much his heir as you now" (looking at his sinewy arm);
    </p>
    <p>
     "at least, he doesn't listen as much to you. I mean, the river runs into
    </p>
    <p>
     the gipsies' country as straight as it can go."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just so."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, you seem very cool about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am not going down the river."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then, where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "On the Lake."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Whew!" (whistling) "Pooh! Why, the Lake's--let me see, to Heron Bay
    </p>
    <p>
     it's quite fifteen miles. You can't paddle across the land."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I can put the canoe on a cart."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aha! why didn't you tell me before?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because I did not wish anyone to know. Don't say anything."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not I. But what on earth, or rather, on water, are you driving at?
    </p>
    <p>
     Where are you going? What's the canoe for?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am going a voyage. But I will tell you all when it is ready.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, I rely on you to keep silence. The rest think the boat is for
    </p>
    <p>
     the river."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will not say a word. But why did you not have a hide boat?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "They are not strong enough. They can't stand knocking about."
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you want to go a voyage (where to, I can't imagine), why not take a
    </p>
    <p>
     passage on board a ship?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I want to go my own way. They will only go theirs. Nor do I like the
    </p>
    <p>
     company."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, certainly the sailors are the roughest lot I know. Still, that
    </p>
    <p>
     would not have hurt you. You are rather dainty, Sir Felix!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "My daintiness does not hurt you."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't I speak?" (sharply)
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
     A silence. A cuckoo sang in the forest, and was answered from a tree
    </p>
    <p>
     within the distant palisade. Felix chopped away slowly and deliberately;
    </p>
    <p>
     he was not a good workman. Oliver watched his progress with contempt; he
    </p>
    <p>
     could have put it into shape in half the time. Felix could draw, and
    </p>
    <p>
     design; he could invent, but he was not a practical workman, to give
    </p>
    <p>
     speedy and accurate effect to his ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My opinion is," said Oliver, "that that canoe will not float upright.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's one-sided."
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix, usually so self-controlled, could not refrain from casting his
    </p>
    <p>
     chisel down angrily. But he picked it up again, and said nothing. This
    </p>
    <p>
     silence had more influence upon Oliver, whose nature was very generous,
    </p>
    <p>
     than the bitterest retort. He sat up on the sward.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will help launch it," he said. "We could manage it between us, if you
    </p>
    <p>
     don't want a lot of the fellows down here."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank you. I should like that best."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And I will help you with the cart when you start."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver rolled over on his back, and looked up idly at the white flecks
    </p>
    <p>
     of cloud sailing at a great height.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Old Mouse is a wretch not to give me a command," he said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix looked round involuntarily, lest any one should have heard; Mouse
    </p>
    <p>
     was the nick-name for the Prince. Like all who rule with irresponsible
    </p>
    <p>
     power, the Prince had spies everywhere. He was not a cruel man, nor a
    </p>
    <p>
     benevolent, neither clever nor foolish, neither strong nor weak; simply
    </p>
    <p>
     an ordinary, a very ordinary being, who chanced to sit upon a throne
    </p>
    <p>
     because his ancestors did, and not from any personal superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was at times much influenced by those around him; at others he took
    </p>
    <p>
     his own course, right or wrong; at another he let matters drift. There
    </p>
    <p>
     was never any telling in the morning what he might do towards night, for
    </p>
    <p>
     there was no vein of will or bias running through his character. In
    </p>
    <p>
     fact, he lacked character; he was all uncertainty, except in jealousy of
    </p>
    <p>
     his supremacy. Possibly some faint perception of his own incapacity, of
    </p>
    <p>
     the feeble grasp he had upon the State, that seemed outwardly so
    </p>
    <p>
     completely his, occasionally crossed his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hence the furious scenes with his brother; hence the sudden
    </p>
    <p>
     imprisonments and equally sudden pardons; the spies and eavesdroppers,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sequestration of estates for no apparent cause. And, following these
    </p>
    <p>
     erratic severities to the suspected nobles, proclamations giving
    </p>
    <p>
     privileges to the people, and removing taxes. But in a few days these
    </p>
    <p>
     were imposed again, and men who dared to murmur were beaten by the
    </p>
    <p>
     soldiers, or cast into the dungeons. Yet Prince Louis (the family were
    </p>
    <p>
     all of the same name) was not an ill-meaning man; he often meant well,
    </p>
    <p>
     but had no stability or firmness of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was why Felix dreaded lest some chance listener should hear Oliver
    </p>
    <p>
     abuse him. Oliver had been in the army for some time; his excellence in
    </p>
    <p>
     all arms, and especially with lance and sword, his acknowledged courage,
    </p>
    <p>
     and his noble birth, entitled him to a command, however lowly it might
    </p>
    <p>
     be. But he was still in the ranks, and not the slightest recognition had
    </p>
    <p>
     ever been taken of his feats, except, indeed, if whispers were true, by
    </p>
    <p>
     some sweet smiles from a certain lady of the palace, who admired
    </p>
    <p>
     knightly prowess.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver chafed under this neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I would not say that kind of thing," remarked Felix. "Certainly it is
    </p>
    <p>
     annoying."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Annoying! that is a mild expression. Of course, everyone knows the
    </p>
    <p>
     reason. If we had any money, or influence, it would be very different.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Sir Constans has neither gold nor power, and he might have had
    </p>
    <p>
     both."
    </p>
    <p>
     "There was a clerk from the notary's at the house yesterday evening,"
    </p>
    <p>
     said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
     "About the debts, no doubt. Some day the cunning old scoundrel, when he
    </p>
    <p>
     can squeeze no more interest out of us, will find a legal quibble and
    </p>
    <p>
     take the lot."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Or put us in the Blue Chamber, the first time the Prince goes to war
    </p>
    <p>
     and wants money. The Blue Chamber will say, 'Where can we get it? Who's
    </p>
    <p>
     weakest?' 'Why, Sir Constans!' 'Then away with him.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, that will be it. Yet I wish a war would happen; there would be
    </p>
    <p>
     some chance for me. I would go with you in your canoe, but you are going
    </p>
    <p>
     you don't know where. What's your object? Nothing. You don't know
    </p>
    <p>
     yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, you don't; you're a dreamer."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am afraid it is true."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I hate dreams." After a pause, in a lower voice, "Have you any money?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix took out his purse and showed him the copper pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The eldest son of Constans Aquila with ten copper pieces," growled
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver, rising, but taking them all the same. "Lend them to me. I'll try
    </p>
    <p>
     them on the board to-night. Fancy me putting down copper! It's
    </p>
    <p>
     intolerable" (working himself into a rage). "I'll turn bandit, and rob
    </p>
    <p>
     on the roads. I'll go to King Yeo and fight the Welsh. Confusion!"
    </p>
    <p>
     He rushed into the forest, leaving his spear on the sward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix quietly chipped away at the block he was shaping, but his temper,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, was inwardly rising. The same talk, varied in detail, but the same
    </p>
    <p>
     in point, took place every time the brothers were together, and always
    </p>
    <p>
     with the same result of anger. In earlier days Sir Constans had been as
    </p>
    <p>
     forward in all warlike exercises as Oliver was now, and being possessed
    </p>
    <p>
     of extraordinary physical strength, took a leading part among men.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wielding his battle-axe with irresistible force, he distinguished
    </p>
    <p>
     himself in several battles and sieges.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had a singular talent for mechanical construction (the wheel by which
    </p>
    <p>
     water was drawn from the well at the palace was designed by him), but
    </p>
    <p>
     this very ingenuity was the beginning of his difficulties. During a long
    </p>
    <p>
     siege, he invented a machine for casting large stones against the walls,
    </p>
    <p>
     or rather put it together from the fragmentary descriptions he had seen
    </p>
    <p>
     in authors, whose works had almost perished before the dispersion of the
    </p>
    <p>
     ancients; for he, too, had been studious in youth.
    </p>
    <p>
     The old Prince was highly pleased with this engine, which promised him
    </p>
    <p>
     speedy conquest over his enemies, and the destruction of their
    </p>
    <p>
     strongholds. But the nobles who had the hereditary command of the siege
    </p>
    <p>
     artillery, which consisted mainly of battering-rams, could not endure to
    </p>
    <p>
     see their prestige vanishing. They caballed, traduced the Baron, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     fell into disgrace. This disgrace, as he was assured by secret messages
    </p>
    <p>
     from the Prince, was but policy; he would be recalled so soon as the
    </p>
    <p>
     Prince felt himself able to withstand the pressure of the nobles. But it
    </p>
    <p>
     happened that the old Prince died at that juncture, and the present
    </p>
    <p>
     Prince succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
     The enemies of the Baron, having access to him, obtained his confidence;
    </p>
    <p>
     the Baron was arrested and amerced in a heavy fine, the payment of which
    </p>
    <p>
     laid the foundation of those debts which had since been constantly
    </p>
    <p>
     increasing. He was then released, but was not for some two years
    </p>
    <p>
     permitted to approach the Court. Meantime, men of not half his descent,
    </p>
    <p>
     but with an unblushing brow and unctuous tongue, had become the
    </p>
    <p>
     favourites at the palace of the Prince, who, as said before, was not
    </p>
    <p>
     bad, but the mere puppet of circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
     Into competition with these vulgar flatterers Aquila could not enter. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was indeed pride, and nothing but pride, that had kept him from the
    </p>
    <p>
     palace. By slow degrees he had sunk out of sight, occupying himself more
    </p>
    <p>
     and more with mechanical inventions, and with gardening, till at last he
    </p>
    <p>
     had come to be regarded as no more than an agriculturist. Yet in this
    </p>
    <p>
     obscure condition he had not escaped danger.
    </p>
    <p>
     The common people were notoriously attached to him. Whether this was due
    </p>
    <p>
     to his natural kindliness, his real strength of intellect, and charm of
    </p>
    <p>
     manner, or whether it was on account of the uprightness with which he
    </p>
    <p>
     judged between them, or whether it was owing to all these things
    </p>
    <p>
     combined, certain it is that there was not a man on the estate that
    </p>
    <p>
     would not have died for him. Certain it is, too, that he was beloved by
    </p>
    <p>
     the people of the entire district, and more especially by the shepherds
    </p>
    <p>
     of the hills, who were freer and less under the control of the patrician
    </p>
    <p>
     caste. Instead of carrying disputes to the town, to be adjudged by the
    </p>
    <p>
     Prince's authority, many were privately brought to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     This, by degrees becoming known, excited the jealousy and anger of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Prince, an anger cunningly inflamed by the notary Francis, and by other
    </p>
    <p>
     nobles. But they hesitated to execute anything against him lest the
    </p>
    <p>
     people should rise, and it was doubtful, indeed, if the very retainers
    </p>
    <p>
     of the nobles would attack the Old House, if ordered. Thus the Baron's
    </p>
    <p>
     weakness was his defence. The Prince, to do him justice, soon forgot the
    </p>
    <p>
     matter, and laughed at his own folly, that he should be jealous of a man
    </p>
    <p>
     who was no more than an agriculturist.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest were not so appeased; they desired the Baron's destruction if
    </p>
    <p>
     only from hatred of his popularity, and they lost no opportunity of
    </p>
    <p>
     casting discredit upon him, or of endeavouring to alienate the
    </p>
    <p>
     affections of the people by representing him as a magician, a thing
    </p>
    <p>
     clearly proved by his machines and engines, which must have been
    </p>
    <p>
     designed by some supernatural assistance. But the chief, as the most
    </p>
    <p>
     immediate and pressing danger, was the debt to Francis the notary, which
    </p>
    <p>
     might at any moment be brought before the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus it was that the three sons found themselves without money or
    </p>
    <p>
     position, with nothing but a bare patent of nobility. The third and
    </p>
    <p>
     youngest alone had made any progress, if such it could be called. By
    </p>
    <p>
     dint of his own persistent efforts, and by enduring insults and rebuffs
    </p>
    <p>
     with indifference, he had at last obtained an appointment in that
    </p>
    <p>
     section of the Treasury which received the dues upon merchandise, and
    </p>
    <p>
     regulated the imposts. He was but a messenger at every man's call; his
    </p>
    <p>
     pay was not sufficient to obtain his food, still it was an advance, and
    </p>
    <p>
     he was in a government office. He could but just exist in the town,
    </p>
    <p>
     sleeping in a garret, where he stored the provisions he took in with him
    </p>
    <p>
     every Monday morning from the Old House. He came home on the Saturday
    </p>
    <p>
     and returned to his work on the Monday. Even his patience was almost
    </p>
    <p>
     worn out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole place was thus falling to decay, while at the same time it
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to be flowing with milk and honey, for under the Baron's personal
    </p>
    <p>
     attention the estate, though so carelessly guarded, had become a very
    </p>
    <p>
     garden. The cattle had increased, and were of the best kind, the horses
    </p>
    <p>
     were celebrated and sought for, the sheep valued, the crops the wonder
    </p>
    <p>
     of the province. Yet there was no money; the product went to the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
     This extraordinary fertility was the cause of the covetous longing of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Court favourites to divide the spoil.

     CHAPTER V
    </head>
    <p>
     BARON AQUILA
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix's own position was bitter in the extreme. He felt he had talent.
    </p>
    <p>
     He loved deeply, he knew that he was in turn as deeply beloved; but he
    </p>
    <p>
     was utterly powerless. On the confines of the estate, indeed, the men
    </p>
    <p>
     would run gladly to do his bidding. Beyond, and on his own account, he
    </p>
    <p>
     was helpless. Manual labour (to plough, to sow, to work on shipboard)
    </p>
    <p>
     could produce nothing in a time when almost all work was done by
    </p>
    <p>
     bondsmen or family retainers. The life of a hunter in the woods was
    </p>
    <p>
     free, but produced nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The furs he sold simply maintained him; it was barter for existence, not
    </p>
    <p>
     profit. The shepherds on the hills roamed in comparative freedom, but
    </p>
    <p>
     they had no wealth except of sheep. He could not start as a merchant
    </p>
    <p>
     without money; he could not enclose an estate and build a house or
    </p>
    <p>
     castle fit for the nuptials of a noble's daughter without money, or that
    </p>
    <p>
     personal influence which answers the same purpose; he could not even
    </p>
    <p>
     hope to succeed to the hereditary estate, so deeply was it encumbered;
    </p>
    <p>
     they might, indeed, at any time be turned forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly the iron entered into his soul. This hopelessness, helplessness,
    </p>
    <p>
     embittered every moment. His love increasing with the passage of time
    </p>
    <p>
     rendered his position hateful in the extreme. The feeling within that he
    </p>
    <p>
     had talent which only required opportunity stung him like a scorpion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The days went by, and everything remained the same. Continual brooding
    </p>
    <p>
     and bitterness of spirit went near to drive him mad.
    </p>
    <p>
     At last the resolution was taken, he would go forth into the world. That
    </p>
    <p>
     involved separation from Aurora, long separation, and without
    </p>
    <p>
     communication, since letters could be sent only by special messenger,
    </p>
    <p>
     and how should he pay a messenger? It was this terrible thought of
    </p>
    <p>
     separation which had so long kept him inactive. In the end the
    </p>
    <p>
     bitterness of hopelessness forced him to face it. He began the canoe,
    </p>
    <p>
     but kept his purpose secret, especially from her, lest tears should melt
    </p>
    <p>
     his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were but two ways of travelling open to him: on foot, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     hunters did, or by the merchant vessels. The latter, of course, required
    </p>
    <p>
     payment, and their ways were notoriously coarse. If on foot he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     cross the Lake, nor visit the countries on either shore, nor the
    </p>
    <p>
     islands; therefore he cut down the poplar and commenced the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whither he should go, and what he should do, was entirely at the mercy
    </p>
    <p>
     of circumstances. He had no plan, no route.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had a dim idea of offering his services to some distant king or
    </p>
    <p>
     prince, of unfolding to him the inventions he had made. He tried to
    </p>
    <p>
     conceal from himself that he would probably be repulsed and laughed at.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without money, without a retinue, how could he expect to be received or
    </p>
    <p>
     listened to? Still, he must go; he could not help himself, go he must.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he chopped and chipped through the long weeks of early spring, while
    </p>
    <p>
     the easterly winds bent the trees above him, till the buds unfolded and
    </p>
    <p>
     the leaves expanded--while his hands were thus employed, the whole map,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were, of the known countries seemed to pass without volition
    </p>
    <p>
     before his mind. He saw the cities along the shores of the great Lake;
    </p>
    <p>
     he saw their internal condition, the weakness of the social fabric, the
    </p>
    <p>
     misery of the bondsmen. The uncertain action of the League, the only
    </p>
    <p>
     thread which bound the world together; the threatening aspect of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Cymry and the Irish; the dread north, the vast northern forests, from
    </p>
    <p>
     which at any time invading hosts might descend on the fertile south--it
    </p>
    <p>
     all went before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was there behind the immense and untraversed belt of forest which
    </p>
    <p>
     extended to the south, to the east, and west? Where did the great Lake
    </p>
    <p>
     end? Were the stories of the gold and silver mines of Devon and Cornwall
    </p>
    <p>
     true? And where were the iron mines, from which the ancients drew their
    </p>
    <p>
     stores of metal?
    </p>
    <p>
     Led by these thoughts he twice or thrice left his labour, and walking
    </p>
    <p>
     some twenty miles through the forests, and over the hills, reached the
    </p>
    <p>
     summit of White Horse. From thence, resting on the sward, he watched the
    </p>
    <p>
     vessels making slow progress by oars, and some drawn with ropes by gangs
    </p>
    <p>
     of men or horses on the shore, through the narrow straits. North and
    </p>
    <p>
     South there nearly met. There was but a furlong of water between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     If ever the North came down there the armies would cross. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     the key of the world. Excepting the few cottages where the owners of the
    </p>
    <p>
     horses lived, there was neither castle nor town within twenty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forced on by these thoughts, he broke the long silence which had existed
    </p>
    <p>
     between him and his father. He spoke of the value and importance of this
    </p>
    <p>
     spot; could not the Baron send forth his retainers and enclose a new
    </p>
    <p>
     estate there? There was nothing to prevent him. The forest was free to
    </p>
    <p>
     all, provided that they rendered due service to the Prince. Might not a
    </p>
    <p>
     house or castle built there become the beginning of a city? The Baron
    </p>
    <p>
     listened, and then said he must go and see that a new hatch was put in
    </p>
    <p>
     the brook to irrigate the water-meadow. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix next wrote an anonymous letter to the Prince pointing out the
    </p>
    <p>
     value of the place. The Prince should seize it, and add to his power. He
    </p>
    <p>
     knew that the letter was delivered, but there was no sign. It had
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, been read and laughed at. Why make further efforts when they
    </p>
    <p>
     already had what they desired? One only, the deep and designing
    </p>
    <p>
     Valentine, gave it serious thought in secret. It seemed to him that
    </p>
    <p>
     something might come of it, another day, when he was himself in
    </p>
    <p>
     power--if that should happen. But he, too, forgot it in a week. Some
    </p>
    <p>
     secret effort was made to discover the writer, for the council were very
    </p>
    <p>
     jealous of political opinion, but it soon ended. The idea, not being
    </p>
    <p>
     supported by money or influence, fell into oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix worked on, chipping out the canoe. The days passed, and the boat
    </p>
    <p>
     was nearly finished. In a day or two now it would be launched, and soon
    </p>
    <p>
     afterwards he should commence his voyage. He should see Aurora once more
    </p>
    <p>
     only. He should see her, but he should not say farewell; she would not
    </p>
    <p>
     know that he was going till he had actually departed. As he thought thus
    </p>
    <p>
     a dimness came before his eyes; his hand trembled, and he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     work. He put down the chisel, and paused to steady himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon the other side of the stream, somewhat lower down, a yellow
    </p>
    <p>
     wood-dog had been lapping the water to quench its thirst, watching the
    </p>
    <p>
     man the while. So long as Felix was intent upon his work, the wild
    </p>
    <p>
     animal had no fear; the moment he looked up, the creature sprang back
    </p>
    <p>
     into the underwood. A dove was cooing in the forest not far distant, but
    </p>
    <p>
     as he was about to resume work the cooing ceased. Then a wood-pigeon
    </p>
    <p>
     rose from the ashes with a loud clapping of wings. Felix listened. His
    </p>
    <p>
     hunter instinct told him that something was moving there. A rustling of
    </p>
    <p>
     the bushes followed, and he took his spear which had been leant against
    </p>
    <p>
     the adjacent tree. But, peering into the wood, in a moment he recognised
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver, who, having walked off his rage, was returning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I though it might have been a Bushman," said Felix, replacing his
    </p>
    <p>
     spear; "only they are noiseless."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Any of them might have cut me down," said Oliver; "for I forgot my
    </p>
    <p>
     weapon. It is nearly noon; are you coming home to dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes; I must bring my tools."
    </p>
    <p>
     He put them in the basket, and together they returned to the rope
    </p>
    <p>
     ladder. As they passed the Pen by the river they caught sight of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Baron in the adjacent gardens, which were irrigated by his contrivances
    </p>
    <p>
     from the stream, and went towards him. A retainer held two horses, one
    </p>
    <p>
     gaily caparisoned, outside the garden; his master was talking with Sir
    </p>
    <p>
     Constans.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is Lord John," said Oliver. They approached slowly under the
    </p>
    <p>
     fruit-trees, not to intrude. Sir Constans was showing the courtier an
    </p>
    <p>
     early cherry-tree, whose fruit was already set. The dry hot weather had
    </p>
    <p>
     caused it to set even earlier than usual. A suit of black velvet, an
    </p>
    <p>
     extremely expensive and almost unprocurable material, brought the
    </p>
    <p>
     courtier's pale features into relief. It was only by the very oldest
    </p>
    <p>
     families that any velvet or satin or similar materials were still
    </p>
    <p>
     preserved; if these were in pecuniary difficulties they might sell some
    </p>
    <p>
     part of their store, but such things were not to be got for money in the
    </p>
    <p>
     ordinary way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two small silver bars across his left shoulder showed that he was a
    </p>
    <p>
     lord-in-waiting. He was a handsome man, with clear-cut features,
    </p>
    <p>
     somewhat rakish from late hours and dissipation, but not the less
    </p>
    <p>
     interesting on that account. But his natural advantages were so over-run
    </p>
    <p>
     with the affectation of the Court that you did not see the man at all,
    </p>
    <p>
     being absorbed by the studied gesture to display the jewelled ring, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the peculiarly low tone of voice in which it was the fashion to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beside the old warrior he looked a mere stripling. The Baron's arm was
    </p>
    <p>
     bare, his sleeve rolled up; and as he pointed to the tree above, the
    </p>
    <p>
     muscles, as the limb moved, displayed themselves in knots, at which the
    </p>
    <p>
     courtier himself could not refrain from glancing. Those mighty arms, had
    </p>
    <p>
     they clasped him about the waist, could have crushed his bending ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The heaviest blow that he could have struck upon that broad chest would
    </p>
    <p>
     have produced no more effect than a hollow sound; it would not even have
    </p>
    <p>
     shaken that powerful frame.
    </p>
    <p>
     He felt the steel blue eye, bright as the sky of midsummer, glance into
    </p>
    <p>
     his very mind. The high forehead bare, for the Baron had his hat in his
    </p>
    <p>
     hand, mocked at him in its humility. The Baron bared his head in honour
    </p>
    <p>
     of the courtier's office and the Prince who had sent him. The beard,
    </p>
    <p>
     though streaked with white, spoke little of age; it rather indicated an
    </p>
    <p>
     abundant, a luxuriant vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord John was not at ease. He shifted from foot to foot, and
    </p>
    <p>
     occasionally puffed a large cigar of Devon tobacco. His errand was
    </p>
    <p>
     simple enough. Some of the ladies at the Court had a fancy for fruit,
    </p>
    <p>
     especially strawberries, but there were none in the market, nor to be
    </p>
    <p>
     obtained from the gardens about the town. It was recollected that Sir
    </p>
    <p>
     Constans was famous for his gardens, and the Prince despatched Lord John
    </p>
    <p>
     to Old House with a gracious message and request for a basket of
    </p>
    <p>
     strawberries. Sir Constans was much pleased; but he regretted that the
    </p>
    <p>
     hot, dry weather had not permitted the fruit to come to any size or
    </p>
    <p>
     perfection. Still there were some.
    </p>
    <p>
     The courtier accompanied him to the gardens, and saw the water-wheel
    </p>
    <p>
     which, turned by a horse, forced water from the stream into a small pond
    </p>
    <p>
     or elevated reservoir, from which it irrigated the ground. This supply
    </p>
    <p>
     of water had brought on the fruit, and Sir Constans was able to gather a
    </p>
    <p>
     small basket. He then looked round to see what other early product he
    </p>
    <p>
     could send to the palace. There was no other fruit; the cherries, though
    </p>
    <p>
     set, were not ripe; but there was some asparagus, which had not yet been
    </p>
    <p>
     served, said Lord John, at the Prince's table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir Constans set men to hastily collect all that was ready, and while
    </p>
    <p>
     this was done took the courtier over the gardens. Lord John felt no
    </p>
    <p>
     interest whatever in such matters, but he could not choose but admire
    </p>
    <p>
     the extraordinary fertility of the enclosure, and the variety of the
    </p>
    <p>
     products. There was everything; fruit of all kinds, herbs of every
    </p>
    <p>
     species, plots specially devoted to those possessing medicinal virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was only one part of the gardens; the orchards proper were farther
    </p>
    <p>
     down, and the flowers nearer the house. Sir Constans had sent a man to
    </p>
    <p>
     the flower-garden, who now returned with two fine bouquets, which were
    </p>
    <p>
     presented to Lord John: the one for the Princess, the Prince's sister;
    </p>
    <p>
     the other for any lady to whom he might choose to present it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fruit had already been handed to the retainer who had charge of the
    </p>
    <p>
     horses. Though interested, in spite of himself, Lord John, acknowledging
    </p>
    <p>
     the flowers, turned to go with a sense of relief. This simplicity of
    </p>
    <p>
     manners seemed discordant to him. He felt out of place, and in some way
    </p>
    <p>
     lowered in his own esteem, and yet he despised the rural retirement and
    </p>
    <p>
     beauty about him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix and Oliver, a few yards distant, were waiting with rising tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spectacle of the Baron in his native might of physique, humbly
    </p>
    <p>
     standing, hat in hand, before this Court messenger, discoursing on
    </p>
    <p>
     cherries, and offering flowers and fruit, filled them with anger and
    </p>
    <p>
     disgust. The affected gesture and subdued voice of the courtier, on the
    </p>
    <p>
     other hand, roused an equal contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Lord John turned, he saw them. He did not quite guess their
    </p>
    <p>
     relationship, but supposed they were cadets of the house, it being
    </p>
    <p>
     customary for those in any way connected to serve the head of the
    </p>
    <p>
     family. He noted the flag basket in Felix's hand, and naturally imagined
    </p>
    <p>
     that he had been at work.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You have been to-to plough, eh?" he said, intending to be very gracious
    </p>
    <p>
     and condescending. "Very healthy employment. The land requires some
    </p>
    <p>
     rain, does it not? Still I trust it will not rain till I am home, for my
    </p>
    <p>
     plume's sake," tossing his head. "Allow me," and as he passed he offered
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver a couple of cigars. "One each," he added; "the best Devon."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver took the cigars mechanically, holding them as if they had been
    </p>
    <p>
     vipers, at arm's length, till the courtier had left the garden, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     hedge interposed. Then he threw them into the water-carrier. The best
    </p>
    <p>
     tobacco, indeed the only real tobacco, came from the warm Devon land,
    </p>
    <p>
     but little of it reached so far, on account of the distance, the
    </p>
    <p>
     difficulties of intercourse, the rare occasions on which the merchant
    </p>
    <p>
     succeeded in escaping the vexatious interference, the downright robbery
    </p>
    <p>
     of the way. Intercourse was often entirely closed by war.
    </p>
    <p>
     These cigars, therefore, were worth their weight in silver, and such
    </p>
    <p>
     tobacco could be obtained only by those about the Court, as a matter of
    </p>
    <p>
     favour, too, rather than by purchase. Lord John would, indeed, have
    </p>
    <p>
     stared aghast had he seen the rustic to whom he had given so valuable a
    </p>
    <p>
     present cast them into a ditch. He rode towards the Maple Gate, excusing
    </p>
    <p>
     his haste volubly to Sir Constans, who was on foot, and walked beside
    </p>
    <p>
     him a little way, pressing him to take some refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
     His sons overtook the Baron as he walked towards home, and walked by his
    </p>
    <p>
     side in silence. Sir Constans was full of his fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The wall cherry," said he, "will soon have a few ripe."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver swore a deep but soundless oath in his chest. Sir Constans
    </p>
    <p>
     continued talking about his fruit and flowers, entirely oblivious of the
    </p>
    <p>
     silent anger of the pair beside him. As they approached the house, the
    </p>
    <p>
     warder blew his horn thrice for noon. It was also the signal for dinner.

     CHAPTER VI

    <p>
     THE FOREST TRACK
    </p>
    <p>
     When the canoe was finished, Oliver came to help Felix launch it, and
    </p>
    <p>
     they rolled it on logs down to the place where the stream formed a pool.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when it was afloat, as Oliver had foretold, it did not swim upright
    </p>
    <p>
     in the water. It had not been shaped accurately, and one side was higher
    </p>
    <p>
     out of the water than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix was so disgusted at this failure that he would not listen to
    </p>
    <p>
     anything Oliver could suggest. He walked back to the spot where he had
    </p>
    <p>
     worked so many weeks, and sat down with his face turned from the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not so much the actual circumstance which depressed him, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     long train of untoward incidents which had preceded it for years past.
    </p>
    <p>
     These seemed to have accumulated, till now this comparatively little
    </p>
    <p>
     annoyance was like the last straw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver followed him, and said that the defect could be remedied by
    </p>
    <p>
     placing ballast on the more buoyant side of the canoe to bring it down
    </p>
    <p>
     to the level of the other; or, perhaps, if some more wood were cut away
    </p>
    <p>
     on the heavier side, that it would cause it to rise. He offered to do
    </p>
    <p>
     the work himself, but Felix, in his gloomy mood, would not answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver returned to the pool, and getting into the canoe, poled it up and
    </p>
    <p>
     down the stream. It answered perfectly, and could be easily managed; the
    </p>
    <p>
     defect was more apparent than real, for when a person sat in the canoe,
    </p>
    <p>
     his weight seemed to bring it nearly level.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was only when empty that it canted to one side. He came back again to
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix, and pointed this out to him. The attempt was useless; the boat
    </p>
    <p>
     might answer the purpose perfectly well, but it was not the boat Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     had intended it to be. It did not come up to his ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver was now somewhat annoyed at Felix's sullen silence, so he drew
    </p>
    <p>
     the canoe partly on shore, to prevent it from floating away, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     left him to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing more was said about it for a day or two. Felix did not go near
    </p>
    <p>
     the spot where he had worked so hard and so long, but on the Saturday
    </p>
    <p>
     Philip came home as usual, and, as there was now no secret about the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe, went down to look at it with Oliver. They pushed it off, and
    </p>
    <p>
     floated two or three miles down the stream, hauling it on the shore past
    </p>
    <p>
     the fallen fir tree, and then, with a cord, towed it back again. The
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe, with the exception of the trifling deficiency alluded to, was a
    </p>
    <p>
     good one, and thoroughly serviceable.
    </p>
    <p>
     They endeavoured again to restore Felix's opinion of it, and an idea
    </p>
    <p>
     occurring to Philip, he said a capital plan would be to add an
    </p>
    <p>
     outrigger, and so balance it perfectly. But though usually quick to
    </p>
    <p>
     adopt ideas when they were good, in this case Felix was too much out of
    </p>
    <p>
     conceit with himself. He would listen to nothing. Still, he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     banish it from his mind, though now ashamed to return to it after so
    </p>
    <p>
     obstinately refusing all suggestions. He wandered aimlessly about in the
    </p>
    <p>
     woods, till one day he found himself in the path that led to Heron Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strolling to the shore of the great Lake, he sat down and watched a
    </p>
    <p>
     vessel sailing afar off slowly before the east wind. The thought
    </p>
    <p>
     presently occurred to him, that the addition of an outrigger in the
    </p>
    <p>
     manner Philip had mentioned would enable him to carry a sail. The canoe
    </p>
    <p>
     could not otherwise support a sail (unless a very small one merely for
    </p>
    <p>
     going before the breeze), but with such a sail as the outrigger would
    </p>
    <p>
     bear, he could venture much farther away from land, his voyage might be
    </p>
    <p>
     much more extended, and his labour with the paddle lessened.
    </p>
    <p>
     This filled him with fresh energy; he returned, and at once recommenced
    </p>
    <p>
     work. Oliver, finding that he was again busy at it, came and insisted
    </p>
    <p>
     upon assisting. With his help, the work progressed rapidly. He used the
    </p>
    <p>
     tools so deftly as to accomplish more in an hour than Felix could in a
    </p>
    <p>
     day. The outrigger consisted of a beam of poplar, sharpened at both
    </p>
    <p>
     ends, and held at some six or seven feet from the canoe by two strong
    </p>
    <p>
     cross-pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     A mast, about the same height as the canoe was long, was then set up; it
    </p>
    <p>
     was made from a young fir-tree. Another smaller fir supplied the yard,
    </p>
    <p>
     which extended fore and aft, nearly the length of the boat. The sail, of
    </p>
    <p>
     coarse canvas, was not very high, but long, and rather broader at each
    </p>
    <p>
     end where the rope attached it to the prow and stern, or, rather, the
    </p>
    <p>
     two prows. Thus arranged, it was not so well suited for running straight
    </p>
    <p>
     before the wind, as for working into it, a feat never attempted by the
    </p>
    <p>
     ships of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver was delighted with the appearance of the boat, so much so that
    </p>
    <p>
     now and then he announced his intention of accompanying Felix on his
    </p>
    <p>
     voyage. But after a visit to the town, and a glance at the Princess
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucia, his resolution changed. Yet he wavered, one time openly
    </p>
    <p>
     reproaching himself for enduring such a life of inaction and ignominy,
    </p>
    <p>
     and at another deriding Felix and his visionary schemes. The canoe was
    </p>
    <p>
     now completed; it was tried on the pool and found to float exactly as it
    </p>
    <p>
     should. It had now to be conveyed to Heron Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
     The original intention was to put it on a cart, but the rude carts used
    </p>
    <p>
     on the estate could not very well carry it, and a sledge was
    </p>
    <p>
     substituted. Several times, during the journey through the forest, the
    </p>
    <p>
     sledge had to be halted while the underwood was cut away to permit of
    </p>
    <p>
     its passing; and once a slough had to be filled up with branches hewn
    </p>
    <p>
     from fir trees, and bundles of fern. These delays made it evening before
    </p>
    <p>
     the shore of the creek was reached.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was but a little inlet, scarce a bowshot wide at the entrance and
    </p>
    <p>
     coming to a point inland. Here the canoe was left in charge of three
    </p>
    <p>
     serfs, who were ordered to build a hut and stay beside it. Some
    </p>
    <p>
     provisions were sent next day on the backs of other serfs, and in the
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon (it was Saturday) all three brothers arrived; the canoe was
    </p>
    <p>
     launched, and they started for a trial sail. With a south wind they ran
    </p>
    <p>
     to the eastward at a rapid pace, keeping close to the shore till within
    </p>
    <p>
     a mile of White Horse.
    </p>
    <p>
     There they brought to by steering the canoe dead against the wind; then
    </p>
    <p>
     transferring the steering-paddle (a rather large one, made for the
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose) to the other end, and readjusting the sail, the outrigger being
    </p>
    <p>
     still to leeward, they ran back at an equal speed. The canoe answered
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly, and Felix was satisfied. He now despatched his tools and
    </p>
    <p>
     various weapons to the hut to be put on board. His own peculiar yew bow
    </p>
    <p>
     he kept to the last at home; it and his chest bound with hide would go
    </p>
    <p>
     with him on the last day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although, in his original purpose, Felix had designed to go forth
    </p>
    <p>
     without anyone being aware of his intention, the circumstances which had
    </p>
    <p>
     arisen, and the necessary employment of so many men, had let out the
    </p>
    <p>
     secret to some degree. The removal of the tools and weapons, the
    </p>
    <p>
     crossbow, darts, and spear, still more attracted attention. But little
    </p>
    <p>
     or nothing was said about it, though the Baron and Baroness could not
    </p>
    <p>
     help but observe these preparations. The Baron deliberately shut his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes and went about his gardening; he was now, too, busy with the first
    </p>
    <p>
     mowing. In his heart, perhaps, he felt that he had not done altogether
    </p>
    <p>
     right in so entirely retiring from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     By doing so he had condemned his children to loneliness, and to be
    </p>
    <p>
     regarded with contempt. Too late now, he could only obstinately persist
    </p>
    <p>
     in his course. The Baroness, inured for so many, many years to
    </p>
    <p>
     disappointment, had contracted her view of life till it scarcely
    </p>
    <p>
     extended beyond mere physical comfort. Nor could she realize the idea of
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix's approaching departure; when he was actually gone, it would,
    </p>
    <p>
     perhaps, come home to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     All was now ready, and Felix was only waiting for the Feast of St. James
    </p>
    <p>
     to pay a last visit to Aurora at Thyma Castle. The morning before the
    </p>
    <p>
     day of the Feast, Felix and Oliver set out together. They had not lived
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether in harmony, but now, at this approaching change, Oliver felt
    </p>
    <p>
     that he must bear Felix company. Oliver rode his beautiful Night, he
    </p>
    <p>
     wore his plumed hat and precious sword, and carried his horseman's
    </p>
    <p>
     lance. Felix rode a smaller horse, useful, but far from handsome. He
    </p>
    <p>
     carried his yew bow and hunting knife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thyma Castle was situated fifteen miles to the south; it was the last
    </p>
    <p>
     outpost of civilization; beyond it there was nothing but forest, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     wild open plains, the home of the gipsies. This circumstance of position
    </p>
    <p>
     had given Baron Thyma, in times past, a certain importance more than was
    </p>
    <p>
     due to the size of his estate or the number of his retainers. During an
    </p>
    <p>
     invasion of the gipsies, his castle bore the brunt of the war, and its
    </p>
    <p>
     gallant defence, indeed, broke their onward progress. So many fell in
    </p>
    <p>
     endeavouring to take it, that the rest were disheartened, and only
    </p>
    <p>
     scattered bands penetrated beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
     For this service the Baron received the grant of various privileges; he
    </p>
    <p>
     was looked on as a pillar of the State, and was welcome at the court.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it proved an injury to him in the end. His honours, and the high
    </p>
    <p>
     society they led him into, were too great for the comparative smallness
    </p>
    <p>
     of his income. Rich in flocks and herds, he had but little coin.
    </p>
    <p>
     High-spirited, and rather fond of display, he could not hold back; he
    </p>
    <p>
     launched forth, with the usual result of impoverishment, mortgage, and
    </p>
    <p>
     debt.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had hoped to obtain the command of an army in the wars that broke out
    </p>
    <p>
     from time to time; it was, indeed, universally admitted that he was in
    </p>
    <p>
     every respect qualified for such a post. The courtiers and others,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, jealous, as is ever the case, of ability and real talent,
    </p>
    <p>
     debarred him by their intrigues from attaining his object. Pride
    </p>
    <p>
     prevented him from acquiescing in this defeat; he strove by display and
    </p>
    <p>
     extravagance to keep himself well to the front, flaunting himself before
    </p>
    <p>
     the eyes of all. This course could not last long; he was obliged to
    </p>
    <p>
     retire to his estate, which narrowly escaped forfeiture to his
    </p>
    <p>
     creditors.
    </p>
    <p>
     So ignominious an end after such worthy service was, however, prevented
    </p>
    <p>
     by the personal interference of the old Prince, who, from his private
    </p>
    <p>
     resources, paid off the most pressing creditors. To the last, the old
    </p>
    <p>
     Prince received him as a friend, and listened to his counsel. Thyma was
    </p>
    <p>
     ever in hopes that some change in the balance of parties would give him
    </p>
    <p>
     his opportunity. When the young Prince succeeded, he was clever enough
    </p>
    <p>
     to see that the presence of such men about his Court gave it a
    </p>
    <p>
     stability, and he, too, invited Thyma to tender his advice. The Baron's
    </p>
    <p>
     hopes now rose higher than ever, but again he was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The new Prince, himself incapable, disliked and distrusted talent. The
    </p>
    <p>
     years passed, and the Baron obtained no appointment. Still he strained
    </p>
    <p>
     his resources to the utmost to visit the Court as often as possible;
    </p>
    <p>
     still he believed that sooner or later a turn of the wheel would elevate
    </p>
    <p>
     him.
    </p>
    <p>
     There had existed between the houses of Thyma and Aquila the bond of
    </p>
    <p>
     hearth-friendship; the gauntlets, hoofs, and rings were preserved by
    </p>
    <p>
     both, and the usual presents passed thrice a year, at midsummer,
    </p>
    <p>
     Christmas, and Lady-day. Not much personal intercourse had taken place,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, for some years, until Felix was attracted by the beauty of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Lady Aurora. Proud, showy, and pushing, Thyma could not understand the
    </p>
    <p>
     feelings which led his hearth-friend to retire from the arena and busy
    </p>
    <p>
     himself with cherries and water-wheels. On the other hand, Constans
    </p>
    <p>
     rather looked with quiet derision on the ostentation of the other. Thus
    </p>
    <p>
     there was a certain distance, as it were, between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Baron Thyma could not, of course, be ignorant of the attachment between
    </p>
    <p>
     his daughter and Felix; yet as much as possible he ignored it. He never
    </p>
    <p>
     referred to Felix; if his name was incidentally mentioned, he remained
    </p>
    <p>
     silent. The truth was, he looked higher for Lady Aurora. He could not in
    </p>
    <p>
     courtesy discourage even in the faintest manner the visits of his
    </p>
    <p>
     friend's son; the knightly laws of honour would have forbidden so mean a
    </p>
    <p>
     course. Nor would his conscience permit him to do so, remembering the
    </p>
    <p>
     old days when he and the Baron were glad companions together, and how
    </p>
    <p>
     the Baron Aquila was the first to lead troops to his assistance in the
    </p>
    <p>
     gipsy war. Still, he tacitly disapproved; he did not encourage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix felt that he was not altogether welcome; he recognised the sense
    </p>
    <p>
     of restraint that prevailed when he was present. It deeply hurt his
    </p>
    <p>
     pride, and nothing but his love for Aurora could have enabled him to
    </p>
    <p>
     bear up against it. The galling part of it was that he could not in his
    </p>
    <p>
     secret heart condemn the father for evidently desiring a better alliance
    </p>
    <p>
     for his child. This was the strongest of the motives that had determined
    </p>
    <p>
     him to seek the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
     If anything, the Baron would have preferred Oliver as a suitor for his
    </p>
    <p>
     daughter; he sympathized with Oliver's fiery spirit, and admired his
    </p>
    <p>
     feats of strength and dexterity with sword and spear. He had always
    </p>
    <p>
     welcomed Oliver heartily, and paid him every attention. This, to do
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver justice, was one reason why he determined to accompany his
    </p>
    <p>
     brother, thinking that if he was there he could occupy attention, and
    </p>
    <p>
     thus enable Felix to have more opportunity to speak with Aurora.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two rode forth from the courtyard early in the morning, and passing
    </p>
    <p>
     through the whole length of the enclosure within the stockade, issued at
    </p>
    <p>
     the South Barrier and almost immediately entered the forest. They rather
    </p>
    <p>
     checked their horses' haste, fresh as the animals were from the stable,
    </p>
    <p>
     but could not quite control their spirits, for the walk of a horse is
    </p>
    <p>
     even half as fast again while he is full of vigour. The turn of the
    </p>
    <p>
     track soon shut out the stockade; they were alone in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long since, early as they were, the sun had dried the dew, for his beams
    </p>
    <p>
     warm the atmosphere quickly as the spring advances towards summer. But
    </p>
    <p>
     it was still fresh and sweet among the trees, and even Felix, though
    </p>
    <p>
     bound on so gloomy an errand, could not choose but feel the joyous
    </p>
    <p>
     influence of the morning. Oliver sang aloud in his rich deep voice, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the thud, thud of the horses' hoofs kept time to the ballad.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thrushes flew but a little way back from the path as they passed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and began to sing again directly they were by. The whistling of
    </p>
    <p>
     blackbirds came from afar where there were open glades or a running
    </p>
    <p>
     stream; the notes of the cuckoo became fainter and fainter as they
    </p>
    <p>
     advanced farther from the stockade, for the cuckoo likes the woodlands
    </p>
    <p>
     that immediately border on cultivation. For some miles the track was
    </p>
    <p>
     broad, passing through thickets of thorn and low hawthorn-trees with
    </p>
    <p>
     immense masses of tangled underwood between, brambles and woodbine
    </p>
    <p>
     twisted and matted together, impervious above but hollow beneath; under
    </p>
    <p>
     these they could hear the bush-hens running to and fro and scratching at
    </p>
    <p>
     the dead leaves which strewed the ground. Sounds of clucking deeper in
    </p>
    <p>
     betrayed the situation of their nests.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rushes, and the dead sedges of last year, up through which the green
    </p>
    <p>
     fresh leaves were thrusting themselves, in some places stood beside the
    </p>
    <p>
     way, fringing the thorns where the hollow ground often held the water
    </p>
    <p>
     from rainstorms. Out from these bushes a rabbit occasionally started and
    </p>
    <p>
     bounded across to the other side. Here, where there were so few trees,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the forest chiefly consisted of bush, they could see some distance
    </p>
    <p>
     on either hand, and also a wide breadth of the sky. After a time the
    </p>
    <p>
     thorn bushes were succeeded by ash wood, where the trees stood closer to
    </p>
    <p>
     the path, contracting the view; it was moister here, the hoofs cut into
    </p>
    <p>
     the grass, which was coarse and rank. The trees growing so close
    </p>
    <p>
     together destroyed themselves, their lower branches rubbed together and
    </p>
    <p>
     were killed, so that in many spots the riders could see a long way
    </p>
    <p>
     between the trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time the wind blew they could hear a distant cracking of branches
    </p>
    <p>
     as the dead boughs, broken by the swaying of the trees, fell off and
    </p>
    <p>
     came down. Had any one attempted to walk into the forest there they
    </p>
    <p>
     would have sunk above the ankle in soft decaying wood, hidden from sight
    </p>
    <p>
     by thick vegetation. Wood-pigeons rose every minute from these ash-trees
    </p>
    <p>
     with a loud clatter of wings; their calls resounded continually, now
    </p>
    <p>
     deep in the forest, and now close at hand. It was evident that a large
    </p>
    <p>
     flock of them had their nesting-place here, and indeed their nests of
    </p>
    <p>
     twigs could be frequently seen from the path. There seemed no other
    </p>
    <p>
     birds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again the forest changed, and the track, passing on higher ground,
    </p>
    <p>
     entered among firs. These, too, had killed each other by growing so
    </p>
    <p>
     thickly; the lower branches of many were dead, and there was nothing but
    </p>
    <p>
     a little green at the tops, while in many places there was an open space
    </p>
    <p>
     where they had decayed away altogether. Brambles covered the ground in
    </p>
    <p>
     these open places, brambles and furze now bright with golden blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
     The jays screeched loudly, startled as the riders passed under them, and
    </p>
    <p>
     fluttered away; rabbits, which they saw again here, dived into their
    </p>
    <p>
     burrows. Between the first the track was very narrow, and they could not
    </p>
    <p>
     conveniently ride side by side; Oliver took the lead, and Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     followed.
    </p>

     CHAPTER VII
    </head>
    <p>
     THE FOREST TRACK CONTINUED
    </p>
    <p>
     Once as they trotted by a pheasant rose screaming from the furze and
    </p>
    <p>
     flew before them down the track. Just afterwards Felix, who had been
    </p>
    <p>
     previously looking very carefully into the firs upon his right hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly stopped, and Oliver, finding this, pulled up as quickly as he
    </p>
    <p>
     could, thinking that Felix wished to tighten his girth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it?" he asked, turning round in his saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hush!" said Felix, dismounting; his horse, trained to hunting, stood
    </p>
    <p>
     perfectly still, and would have remained within a few yards of the spot
    </p>
    <p>
     by the hour together. Oliver reined back, seeing Felix about to bend and
    </p>
    <p>
     string his bow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bushmen," whispered Felix, as he, having fitted the loop to the horn
    </p>
    <p>
     notch, drew forth an arrow from his girdle, where he carried two or
    </p>
    <p>
     three more ready to hand than in the quiver on his shoulder. "I thought
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw signs of them some time since, and now I am nearly sure. Stay here
    </p>
    <p>
     a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
     He stepped aside from the track in among the firs, which just there were
    </p>
    <p>
     far apart, and went to a willow bush standing by some furze. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     noticed that one small branch on the outer part of the bush was snapped
    </p>
    <p>
     off, though green, and only hung by the bark. The wood cattle, had they
    </p>
    <p>
     browsed upon it, would have nibbled the tenderest leaves at the end of
    </p>
    <p>
     the bough; nor did they usually touch willow, for the shoots are bitter
    </p>
    <p>
     and astringent. Nor would the deer touch it in the spring, when they had
    </p>
    <p>
     so wide a choice of food.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing could have broken the branch in that manner unless it was the
    </p>
    <p>
     hand of a man, or a blow with a heavy stick wielded by a human hand. On
    </p>
    <p>
     coming to the bush he saw that the fracture was very recent, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     bough was perfectly green; it had not turned brown, and the bark was
    </p>
    <p>
     still soft with sap. It had not been cut with a knife or any sharp
    </p>
    <p>
     instrument; it had been broken by rude violence, and not divided. The
    </p>
    <p>
     next thing to catch his eye was the appearance of a larger branch
    </p>
    <p>
     farther inside the bush.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was not broken, but a part of the bark was abraded, and even torn
    </p>
    <p>
     up from the wood as if by the impact of some hard substance, as a stone
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown with great force. He examined the ground, but there was no stone
    </p>
    <p>
     visible, and on again looking at the bark he concluded that it had not
    </p>
    <p>
     been done with a stone at all, because the abraded portion was not cut.
    </p>
    <p>
     The blow had been delivered by something without edges or projections.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had now no longer any doubt that the lesser branch outside had been
    </p>
    <p>
     broken, and the large inside branch bruised, by the passage of a
    </p>
    <p>
     Bushman's throw-club.
    </p>
    <p>
     These, their only missile weapons, are usually made of crab-tree, and
    </p>
    <p>
     consist of a very thin short handle, with a large, heavy, and smooth
    </p>
    <p>
     knob. With these they can bring down small game, as rabbits or hares, or
    </p>
    <p>
     a fawn (even breaking the legs of deer), or the large birds, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     wood-turkeys. Stealing up noiselessly within ten yards, the Bushman
    </p>
    <p>
     throws his club with great force, and rarely misses his aim. If not
    </p>
    <p>
     killed at once, the game is certain to be stunned, and is much more
    </p>
    <p>
     easily secured than if wounded with an arrow, for with an arrow in its
    </p>
    <p>
     wing a large bird will flutter along the ground, and perhaps creep into
    </p>
    <p>
     sedges or under impenetrable bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deprived of motion by the blow of the club, it can, on the other hand,
    </p>
    <p>
     be picked up without trouble and without the aid of a dog, and if not
    </p>
    <p>
     dead is despatched by a twist of the Bushman's fingers or a thrust from
    </p>
    <p>
     his spud. The spud is at once his dagger, his knife and fork, his
    </p>
    <p>
     chisel, his grub-axe, and his gouge. It is a piece of iron (rarely or
    </p>
    <p>
     never of steel, for he does not know how to harden it) about ten inches
    </p>
    <p>
     long, an inch and a half wide at the top or broadest end, where it is
    </p>
    <p>
     shaped and sharpened like a chisel, only with the edge not straight but
    </p>
    <p>
     sloping, and from thence tapering to a point at the other, the pointed
    </p>
    <p>
     part being four-sided, like a nail.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has, indeed, been supposed that the original spud was formed from a
    </p>
    <p>
     large wrought-iron nail, such as the ancients used, sharpened on a stone
    </p>
    <p>
     at one end, and beaten out flat at the other. This instrument has a
    </p>
    <p>
     handle in the middle, half-way between the chisel end and the point. The
    </p>
    <p>
     handle is of horn or bone (the spud being put through the hollow of the
    </p>
    <p>
     bone), smoothed to fit the hand. With the chisel end he cuts up his game
    </p>
    <p>
     and his food; the edge, being sloping, is drawn across the meat and
    </p>
    <p>
     divides it. With this end, too, he fashions his club and his traps, and
    </p>
    <p>
     digs up the roots he uses. The other end he runs into his meat as a
    </p>
    <p>
     fork, or thrusts it into the neck of his game to kill it and let out the
    </p>
    <p>
     blood, or with it stabs a sleeping enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
     The stab delivered by the Bushman can always be distinguished, because
    </p>
    <p>
     the wound is invariably square, and thus a clue only too certain has
    </p>
    <p>
     often been afforded to the assassin of many an unfortunate hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever the Bushman in this case had hurled his club at, the club had
    </p>
    <p>
     gone into the willow bush, snapping the light branch and leaving its
    </p>
    <p>
     mark upon the bark of the larger. A moment's reflection convinced Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     that the Bushman had been in chase of a pheasant. Only a few moments
    </p>
    <p>
     previously a pheasant had flown before them down the track, and where
    </p>
    <p>
     there was one pheasant there were generally several more in the
    </p>
    <p>
     immediate neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Bushmen were known to be peculiarly fond of the pheasant, pursuing
    </p>
    <p>
     them all the year round without reference to the breeding season, and so
    </p>
    <p>
     continuously, that it was believed they caused these birds to be much
    </p>
    <p>
     less numerous, notwithstanding the vast extent of the forests, than they
    </p>
    <p>
     would otherwise have been. From the fresh appearance of the snapped
    </p>
    <p>
     bough, the Bushman must have passed but a few hours previously, probably
    </p>
    <p>
     at the dawn, and was very likely concealed at that moment near at hand
    </p>
    <p>
     in the forest, perhaps within a hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix looked carefully round, but could see nothing; there were the
    </p>
    <p>
     trees, not one of them large enough to hide a man behind it, the furze
    </p>
    <p>
     branches were small and scattered, and there was not sufficient fern to
    </p>
    <p>
     conceal anything. The keenest glance could discern nothing more. There
    </p>
    <p>
     were no footmarks on the ground, indeed, the dry, dead leaves and fir
    </p>
    <p>
     needles could hardly have received any impression, and up in the firs
    </p>
    <p>
     the branches were thin, and the sky could be seen through them. Whether
    </p>
    <p>
     the Bushman was lying in some slight depression of the ground, or
    </p>
    <p>
     whether he had covered himself with dead leaves and fir needles, or
    </p>
    <p>
     whether he had gone on and was miles away, there was nothing to show.
    </p>
    <p>
     But of the fact that he had been there Felix was perfectly certain.
    </p>
    <p>
     He returned towards Oliver, thoughtful and not without some anxiety, for
    </p>
    <p>
     he did not like the idea (though there was really little or no danger)
    </p>
    <p>
     of these human wild beasts being so near Aurora, while he should so soon
    </p>
    <p>
     be far away. Thus occupied he did not heed his steps, and suddenly felt
    </p>
    <p>
     something soft under his feet, which struggled. Instantaneously he
    </p>
    <p>
     sprang as far as he could, shuddering, for he had crushed an adder, and
    </p>
    <p>
     but just escaped, by his involuntary and mechanical leap, from its
    </p>
    <p>
     venom.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the warm sunshine the viper, in its gravid state, had not cared to
    </p>
    <p>
     move as usual on hearing his approach; he had stepped full upon it. He
    </p>
    <p>
     hastened from the spot, and rejoined Oliver in a somewhat shaken state
    </p>
    <p>
     of mind. Common as such an incident was in the woods, where sandy soil
    </p>
    <p>
     warned the hunter to be careful, it seemed ominous that particular
    </p>
    <p>
     morning, and, joined with the discovery of Bushman traces, quite
    </p>
    <p>
     destroyed his sense of the beauty of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     On hearing the condition of the willow boughs Oliver agreed as to the
    </p>
    <p>
     cause, and said that they must remember to warn the Baron's shepherds
    </p>
    <p>
     that the Bushmen, who had not been seen for some time, were about. Soon
    </p>
    <p>
     afterwards they emerged from the sombre firs and crossed a wide and
    </p>
    <p>
     sloping ground, almost bare of trees, where a forest fire last year had
    </p>
    <p>
     swept away the underwood. A verdant growth of grass was now springing
    </p>
    <p>
     up. Here they could canter side by side. The sunshine poured down, and
    </p>
    <p>
     birds were singing joyously. But they soon passed it, and checked their
    </p>
    <p>
     speed on entering the trees again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tall beeches, with round smooth trunks, stood thick and close upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     dry and rising ground; their boughs met overhead, forming a green
    </p>
    <p>
     continuous arch for miles. The space between was filled with brake fern,
    </p>
    <p>
     now fast growing up, and the track itself was green with moss. As they
    </p>
    <p>
     came into this beautiful place a red stag, startled from his browsing,
    </p>
    <p>
     bounded down the track, his swift leaps carried him away like the wind;
    </p>
    <p>
     in another moment he left the path and sprang among the fern, and was
    </p>
    <p>
     seen only in glimpses as he passed between the beeches. Squirrels ran up
    </p>
    <p>
     the trunks as they approached; they could see many on the ground in
    </p>
    <p>
     among the trees, and passed under others on the branches high above
    </p>
    <p>
     them. Woodpeckers flashed across the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Oliver pointed out the long, lean flank of a grey pig, or fern-hog,
    </p>
    <p>
     as the animal rushed away among the brake. There were several glades,
    </p>
    <p>
     from one of which they startled a few deer, whose tails only were seen
    </p>
    <p>
     as they bounded into the underwood, but after the glades came the
    </p>
    <p>
     beeches again. Beeches always form the most beautiful forest, beeches
    </p>
    <p>
     and oak; and though nearing the end of their journey, they regretted
    </p>
    <p>
     when they emerged from these trees and saw the castle before them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ground suddenly sloped down into a valley, beyond which rose the
    </p>
    <p>
     Downs; the castle stood on a green isolated low hill, about half-way
    </p>
    <p>
     across the vale. To the left a river wound past; to the right the beech
    </p>
    <p>
     forest extended as far as the eye could see. The slope at their feet had
    </p>
    <p>
     been cleared of all but a few hawthorn bushes. It was not enclosed, but
    </p>
    <p>
     a neatherd was there with his cattle half a mile away, sitting himself
    </p>
    <p>
     at the foot of a beech, while the cattle grazed below him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Down in the valley the stockade began; it was not wide but long. The
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosure extended on the left to the bank of the river, and two fields
    </p>
    <p>
     on the other side of it. On the right it reached a mile and a half or
    </p>
    <p>
     nearly, the whole of which was overlooked from the spot where they had
    </p>
    <p>
     passed. Within the enclosures the corn crops were green and flourishing;
    </p>
    <p>
     horses and cattle, ricks and various buildings, were scattered about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The town or cottages of the serfs were on the bank of the river
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately beyond the castle. On the Downs, which rose a mile or more
    </p>
    <p>
     on the other side of the castle, sheep were feeding; part of the ridge
    </p>
    <p>
     was wooded and part open. Thus the cultivated and enclosed valley was
    </p>
    <p>
     everywhere shut in with woods and hills.
    </p>
    <p>
     The isolated round hill on which the castle stood was itself enclosed
    </p>
    <p>
     with a second stockade; the edge of the brow above that again was
    </p>
    <p>
     defended by a stout high wall of flints and mortar, crenellated at the
    </p>
    <p>
     top. There were no towers or bastions. An old and ivy-grown building
    </p>
    <p>
     stood inside the wall; it dated from the time of the ancients; it had
    </p>
    <p>
     several gables, and was roofed with tiles. This was the dwelling-house.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gardens were situated on the slope between the wall and the inner
    </p>
    <p>
     stockade. Peaceful as the scene appeared, it had been the site of
    </p>
    <p>
     furious fighting not many years ago. The Downs trended to the south,
    </p>
    <p>
     where the Romany and the Zingari resided, and a keen watch was kept both
    </p>
    <p>
     from the wall and from the hills beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
     They now rode slowly down the slope, and in a few minutes reached the
    </p>
    <p>
     barrier or gateway in the outer stockade. They had been observed, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the guard called by the warden, but as they approached were recognised,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the gate swang open before them. Walking their horses they crossed
    </p>
    <p>
     to the hill, and were as easily admitted to the second enclosure. At the
    </p>
    <p>
     gate of the wall they dismounted, and waited while the warden carried
    </p>
    <p>
     the intelligence of their arrival to the family. A moment later, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Baron's son advanced from the porch, and from the open window the
    </p>
    <p>
     Baroness and Aurora beckoned to them.
    </p>

    <p>
     THYMA CASTLE
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon afterwards the hollow sound of the warden's horn, from the watch
    </p>
    <p>
     over the gate of the wall, proclaimed the hour of noon, and they all
    </p>
    <p>
     assembled for dinner in the banqueting chamber. The apartment was on the
    </p>
    <p>
     ground floor, and separated from the larger hall only by an internal
    </p>
    <p>
     wall. The house, erected in the time of the ancients, was not designed
    </p>
    <p>
     for our present style of life; it possessed, indeed, many comforts and
    </p>
    <p>
     conveniences which are scarcely now to be found in the finest palaces,
    </p>
    <p>
     but it lacked the breadth of construction which our architects have now
    </p>
    <p>
     in view.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the front there were originally only two rooms, extensive for those
    </p>
    <p>
     old days, but not sufficiently so for ours. One of these had therefore
    </p>
    <p>
     been enlarged, by throwing into it a back room and part of the entrance,
    </p>
    <p>
     and even then it was not long enough for the Baron's retainers, and at
    </p>
    <p>
     feast-time a wooden shed was built opposite, and up to the window, to
    </p>
    <p>
     continue, as it were, the apartment out of doors. Workmen were busy
    </p>
    <p>
     putting up this shed when they arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second apartment retained its ancient form, and was used as the
    </p>
    <p>
     dining-room on ordinary days. It was lighted by a large window, now
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown wide open that the sweet spring air might enter, which window was
    </p>
    <p>
     the pride of the Baroness, for it contained more true glass than any
    </p>
    <p>
     window in the palace of the Prince. The glass made now is not
    </p>
    <p>
     transparent, but merely translucent; it indeed admits light after a
    </p>
    <p>
     fashion, but it is thick and cannot be seen through. These panes were
    </p>
    <p>
     almost all (the central casement wholly) of ancient glass, preserved
    </p>
    <p>
     with the greatest care through the long years past.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three tables were arranged in an open square; the Baron and Baroness's
    </p>
    <p>
     chairs of oak faced the window, the guests sat at the other tables
    </p>
    <p>
     sideways to them, the servants moved on the outer side, and thus placed
    </p>
    <p>
     the food before them without pushing against or incommoding them. A
    </p>
    <p>
     fourth table was placed in a corner between the fireplace and the
    </p>
    <p>
     window. At it sat the old nurse, the housekeeper (frequently arising to
    </p>
    <p>
     order the servants), and the Baron's henchman, who had taught him to
    </p>
    <p>
     ride, but now, grey and aged, could not mount himself without
    </p>
    <p>
     assistance, and had long ceased from active service.
    </p>
    <p>
     Already eight or nine guests had arrived besides Felix and Oliver. Some
    </p>
    <p>
     had ridden a great distance to be present at the House Day. They were
    </p>
    <p>
     all nobles, richly dressed; one or two of the eldest were wealthy and
    </p>
    <p>
     powerful men, and the youngest was the son and heir of the Earl of
    </p>
    <p>
     Essiton, who was then the favourite at Court. Each had come with his
    </p>
    <p>
     personal attendants; the young Lord Durand brought with him twenty-five
    </p>
    <p>
     retainers, and six gentlemen friends, all of whom were lodged in the
    </p>
    <p>
     town, the gentlemen taking their meals at the castle at the same time as
    </p>
    <p>
     the Baron, but, owing to lack of room, in another apartment by
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves. Durand was placed, or rather, quietly helped himself to a
    </p>
    <p>
     seat, next to the Lady Aurora, and of all the men there present,
    </p>
    <p>
     certainly there was none more gallant and noble than he.
    </p>
    <p>
     His dark eyes, his curling hair short but brought in a thick curl over
    </p>
    <p>
     his forehead, his lips well shaped, his chin round and somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     prominent, the slight moustache (no other hair on the face), formed the
    </p>
    <p>
     very ideal of what many women look for in a man. But it was his bright,
    </p>
    <p>
     lively conversation, the way in which his slightly swarthy complexion
    </p>
    <p>
     flushed with animation, the impudent assurance and yet generous warmth
    </p>
    <p>
     of his manner, and, indeed, of his feelings, which had given him the
    </p>
    <p>
     merited reputation of being the very flower of the nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
     With such a reputation, backed with the great wealth and power of his
    </p>
    <p>
     father, gentlemen competed with each other to swell his train; he could
    </p>
    <p>
     not, indeed, entertain all that came, and was often besieged with almost
    </p>
    <p>
     as large a crowd as the Prince himself. He took as his right the chair
    </p>
    <p>
     next to Aurora, to whom, indeed, he had been paying unremitting
    </p>
    <p>
     attention all the morning. She was laughing heartily as she sat down, at
    </p>
    <p>
     some sally of his upon a beauty at the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
     The elder men were placed highest up the tables, and nearest the host,
    </p>
    <p>
     but to the astonishment of all, and not the least of himself, Oliver was
    </p>
    <p>
     invited by the Baron to sit by his side. Oliver could not understand
    </p>
    <p>
     this special mark of favour; the others, though far too proud for a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment to resent what they might have deemed a slight upon them, at once
    </p>
    <p>
     began to search their minds for a reason. They knew the Baron as an old
    </p>
    <p>
     intriguer; they attached a meaning, whether intended or not, to his
    </p>
    <p>
     smallest action.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix, crowded out, as it were, and unnoticed, was forced to take his
    </p>
    <p>
     seat at the end of the table nearest that set apart in the corner for
    </p>
    <p>
     the aged and honoured servitors of the family. Only a few feet
    </p>
    <p>
     intervened between him and ancient henchmen; and he could not but
    </p>
    <p>
     overhear their talk among themselves, whispered as it was. He had merely
    </p>
    <p>
     shaken hands with Aurora; the crowd in the drawing-room and the marked
    </p>
    <p>
     attentions of Durand had prevented the exchange of a single word between
    </p>
    <p>
     them. As usual, the sense of neglect and injury over which he had so
    </p>
    <p>
     long brooded with little or no real cause (considering, of course, his
    </p>
    <p>
     position, and that the world can only see our coats and not our hearts),
    </p>
    <p>
     under these entirely accidental circumstances rose up again within him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and blinded him to the actual state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
     His seat, the lowest, and the nearest to the servitors, was in itself a
    </p>
    <p>
     mark of the low estimation in which he was held. The Lord Durand had
    </p>
    <p>
     been placed next to Aurora, as a direct encouragement to him, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     direct hint to himself not to presume. Doubtless, Durand had been at the
    </p>
    <p>
     castle many times, not improbably already been accepted by the Baron,
    </p>
    <p>
     and not altogether refused by Aurora. As a fact, though delighted with
    </p>
    <p>
     her beauty and conversation, Durand's presence was entirely due to the
    </p>
    <p>
     will of his father, the Earl, who wished to maintain friendly relations
    </p>
    <p>
     with Baron Thyma, and even then he would not have come had not the
    </p>
    <p>
     lovely weather invited him to ride into the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, however, so far true, that though his presence was accidental,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet he was fast becoming fascinated by one who, girl though she was, was
    </p>
    <p>
     stronger in mind than he. Now Aurora, knowing that he father's eye was
    </p>
    <p>
     on her, dared not look towards Felix, lest by an open and pronounced
    </p>
    <p>
     conduct she should be the cause of his being informed that his presence
    </p>
    <p>
     was not desirable. She knew that the Baron only needed a pretext to
    </p>
    <p>
     interfere, and was anxious to avoid offering him a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix, seeing her glance bent downwards or towards her companion, and
    </p>
    <p>
     never all the time turned to him, not unnaturally, but too hastily,
    </p>
    <p>
     concluded that she had been dazzled by Durand and the possibility of an
    </p>
    <p>
     alliance with his powerful family. He was discarded, worthless, and of
    </p>
    <p>
     no account; he had nothing but his sword; nay, he had not a sword, he
    </p>
    <p>
     was only an archer, a footman. Angry, jealous, and burning with inward
    </p>
    <p>
     annoyance, despising himself since all others despised him, scarce able
    </p>
    <p>
     to remain at the table, Felix was almost beside himself, and did not
    </p>
    <p>
     answer nor heed the remarks of the gentlemen sitting by him, who put him
    </p>
    <p>
     down as an ill-bred churl.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the form's sake, indeed, he put his lips to the double-handled cup
    </p>
    <p>
     of fine ale, which continually circulated round the table, and was never
    </p>
    <p>
     allowed to be put down; one servant had nothing else to do but to see
    </p>
    <p>
     that its progress never stopped. But he drank nothing, and ate nothing;
    </p>
    <p>
     he could not swallow. How visionary, how weak and feeble now seemed the
    </p>
    <p>
     wild scheme of the canoe and his proposed voyage! Even should it
    </p>
    <p>
     succeed, years must elapse before he could accomplish anything
    </p>
    <p>
     substantial; while here were men who really had what he could only think
    </p>
    <p>
     of or imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silver chain or sword-belt of Durand (the sword and the dagger were
    </p>
    <p>
     not worn at the banquet, nor in the house, they were received by the
    </p>
    <p>
     marshal, and deposited in his care, a precaution against quarrelling),
    </p>
    <p>
     solid silver links passing over his shoulder, were real actual things.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the magnificence that he could call up by the exercise of his
    </p>
    <p>
     imagination, was but imagination; a dream no more to be seen by others
    </p>
    <p>
     than the air itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dinner went on, and the talk became more noisy. The trout, the
    </p>
    <p>
     chicken, the thyme lamb (trapped on the hills by the shepherds), the
    </p>
    <p>
     plover eggs, the sirloin, the pastry (the Baroness superintended the
    </p>
    <p>
     making of it herself), all the profusion of the table, rather set him
    </p>
    <p>
     against food than tempted him. Nor could he drink the tiny drop, as it
    </p>
    <p>
     were, of ancient brandy, sent round to each guest at the conclusion,
    </p>
    <p>
     precious as liquid gold, for it had been handed down from the ancients,
    </p>
    <p>
     and when once the cask was empty it could not be re-filled.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dessert, the strawberries, the nuts and walnuts, carefully preserved
    </p>
    <p>
     with a little salt, and shaken in the basket from time to time that they
    </p>
    <p>
     might not become mouldy, the apples, the honey in the comb with slices
    </p>
    <p>
     of white bread, nothing pleased him. Nor did he drink, otherwise than
    </p>
    <p>
     the sip demanded by courtesy, of the thin wine of Gloucester, costly as
    </p>
    <p>
     it was, grown in the vineyard there, and shipped across the Lake, and
    </p>
    <p>
     rendered still more expensive by risk of pirates. This was poured into
    </p>
    <p>
     flagons of maple wood, which, like the earthenware cup of ale, were
    </p>
    <p>
     never allowed to touch the board till the dinner was over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wearily the time went on; Felix glanced more and more often at the sky
    </p>
    <p>
     seen through the casement, eagerly desiring to escape, and at least to
    </p>
    <p>
     be alone. At last (how long it seemed!) the Baron rose, and immediately
    </p>
    <p>
     the rest did the same, and they drank the health of the Prince. Then a
    </p>
    <p>
     servitor brought in a pile of cigars upon a carved wooden tray, like a
    </p>
    <p>
     large platter, but with a rim. "These," said the Baron, again rising
    </p>
    <p>
     (the signal to all to cease conversing and to listen), "are a present
    </p>
    <p>
     from my gracious and noble friend the Earl of Essiton" (he looked
    </p>
    <p>
     towards Durand), "not less kindly carried by Lord Durand. I could have
    </p>
    <p>
     provided only our own coarse tobacco; but these are the best Devon."
    </p>
    <p>
     The ladies now left the table, Aurora escorted by Durand, the Baroness
    </p>
    <p>
     by Oliver. Oliver, indeed, was in the highest spirits; he had eaten
    </p>
    <p>
     heartily of all; especially the sweet thyme lamb, and drunk as freely.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was in his element, his laugh the loudest, his talk the liveliest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Directly Durand returned (he had gone even a part of the way upstairs
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the drawing-room with Aurora, a thing a little against
    </p>
    <p>
     etiquette) he took his chair, formality being now at an end, and placed
    </p>
    <p>
     it by Oliver. They seemed to become friends at once by sympathy of mind
    </p>
    <p>
     and taste.
    </p>
    <p>
     Round them the rest gradually grouped themselves, so that presently
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix, who did not move, found himself sitting alone at the extreme end
    </p>
    <p>
     of the table; quite apart, for the old retainers, who dined at the
    </p>
    <p>
     separate table, had quitted the apartment when the wine was brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Freed from the restraint of the ladies, the talk now became extremely
    </p>
    <p>
     noisy, the blue smoke from the long cigars filled the great apartment;
    </p>
    <p>
     one only remained untouched, that placed before Felix. Suddenly it
    </p>
    <p>
     struck him that thus sitting alone and apart, he should attract
    </p>
    <p>
     attention; he, therefore, drew his chair to the verge of the group, but
    </p>
    <p>
     remained silent, and as far off as ever. Presently the arrival of five
    </p>
    <p>
     more guests caused a stir and confusion, in the midst of which he
    </p>
    <p>
     escaped into the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
     He wandered towards the gate of the wall, passing the wooden shed where
    </p>
    <p>
     the clink of hammers resounded, glanced at the sundial, which showed the
    </p>
    <p>
     hour of three (three weary hours had they feasted), and went out into
    </p>
    <p>
     the gardens. Still going on, he descended the slope, and not much
    </p>
    <p>
     heeding whither he was going, took the road that led into town. It
    </p>
    <p>
     consisted of some hundred or more houses, built of wood and thatched,
    </p>
    <p>
     placed without plan or arrangement on the bank of the stream. Only one
    </p>
    <p>
     long street ran through it, the rest were mere by-ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     All these were inhabited by the Baron's retainers, but the number and
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently small extent of the houses did not afford correct data for
    </p>
    <p>
     the actual amount of the population. In these days the people (as is
    </p>
    <p>
     well known) find much difficulty in marrying; it seems only possible for
    </p>
    <p>
     a certain proportion to marry, and hence there are always a great number
    </p>
    <p>
     of young or single men out of all ratio to the houses. At the sound of
    </p>
    <p>
     the bugle the Baron could reckon on at least three hundred men flocking
    </p>
    <p>
     without a minute's delay to man the wall; in an hour more would arrive
    </p>
    <p>
     from the outer places, and by nightfall, if the summons went forth in
    </p>
    <p>
     the morning, his shepherds and swineherds would arrive, and these
    </p>
    <p>
     together would add some hundred and fifty to the garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
     Next must be reckoned the armed servants of the house, the Baron's
    </p>
    <p>
     personal attendants, the gentlemen who formed his train, his sons and
    </p>
    <p>
     the male relations of the family; these certainly were not less than
    </p>
    <p>
     fifty. Altogether over five hundred men, well armed and accustomed to
    </p>
    <p>
     the use of their weapons, would range themselves beneath his banner. Two
    </p>
    <p>
     of the buildings in he town were of brick (the material carried hither,
    </p>
    <p>
     for there was no clay or stone thereabouts); they were not far apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one was the Toll House, where all merchants or traders paid the
    </p>
    <p>
     charges in corn or kind due to the Baron; the other was the Court House,
    </p>
    <p>
     where he sat to administer justice and decide causes, or to send the
    </p>
    <p>
     criminal to the gibbet.
    </p>
    <p>
     These alone of the buildings were of any age, for the wooden houses were
    </p>
    <p>
     extremely subject to destruction by fire, and twice in the Baron's time
    </p>
    <p>
     half the town had been laid in ashes, only to rise again in a few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Timber was so abundant and so ready of access, it seemed a loss of
    </p>
    <p>
     labour to fetch stone or brick, or to use the flints of the hills. About
    </p>
    <p>
     the doors of the two inns there were gathered groups of people; among
    </p>
    <p>
     them the liveries of the nobles visiting the castle were conspicuous;
    </p>
    <p>
     the place was full of them, the stables were filled, and their horses
    </p>
    <p>
     were picketed under the trees and even in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every minute the numbers increased as others arrived; men, too (who had
    </p>
    <p>
     obtained permission of their lords), came in on foot, ten or twelve
    </p>
    <p>
     travelling together for mutual protection, for the feuds of their
    </p>
    <p>
     masters exposed them to frequent attack. All (except the nobles) were
    </p>
    <p>
     disarmed at the barrier by the warden and guard, that peace might be
    </p>
    <p>
     preserved in the enclosure. The folk at the moment he passed were
    </p>
    <p>
     watching the descent of three covered waggons from the forest track, in
    </p>
    <p>
     which were travelling the ladies of as many noble families.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some, indeed, of the youngest and boldest ride on horseback, but the
    </p>
    <p>
     ladies chiefly move in these waggons, which are fitted up with
    </p>
    <p>
     considerable comfort, and are necessary to sleep in when the camp is
    </p>
    <p>
     formed by the wayside at night. None noticed him as he went by, except a
    </p>
    <p>
     group of three cottage girls, and a serving-woman, an attendant of a
    </p>
    <p>
     lady visitor at the castle. He heard them allude to him; he quickened
    </p>
    <p>
     his pace, but heard one say, "He's nobody; he hasn't even got a horse."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes he is," replied the serving-woman; "he's Oliver's brother; and I
    </p>
    <p>
     can tell you my lord Oliver is somebody; the Princess Lucia--" and she
    </p>
    <p>
     made the motion of kissing with her lips. Felix, ashamed and annoyed to
    </p>
    <p>
     the last degree, stepped rapidly from the spot. The serving-woman,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, was right in a measure; the real or supposed favour shown
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver by the Prince's sister, the Duchess of Deverell, had begun to be
    </p>
    <p>
     bruited abroad, and this was the secret reason why the Baron had shown
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver so much and so marked an attention, even more than he had paid to
    </p>
    <p>
     Lord Durand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Full well he knew the extraordinary influence possessed by ladies of
    </p>
    <p>
     rank and position. From what we can learn out of the scanty records of
    </p>
    <p>
     the past, it was so even in the days of the ancients; it is a
    </p>
    <p>
     hundredfold more so in these times, when, although every noble must of
    </p>
    <p>
     necessity be taught to read and write, as a matter of fact the men do
    </p>
    <p>
     neither, but all the correspondence of kings and princes, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     diplomatic documents, and notices, and so forth, are one and all, almost
    </p>
    <p>
     without a single exception, drawn up by women. They know the secret and
    </p>
    <p>
     hidden motives of courts, and have this great advantage, that they can
    </p>
    <p>
     use their knowledge without personal fear, since women are never
    </p>
    <p>
     seriously interfered with, but are protected by all.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one terrible and utterly shameful instance to the contrary had not
    </p>
    <p>
     occurred at the time of which we are now speaking, and it was and is
    </p>
    <p>
     still repudiated by every man, from the knight to the boys who gather
    </p>
    <p>
     acorns for the swine. Oliver himself had no idea whatever that he was
    </p>
    <p>
     regarded as a favourite lover of the Duchess; he took the welcome that
    </p>
    <p>
     was held out to him as perfectly honest. Plain, straightforward, and
    </p>
    <p>
     honest, Oliver, had he been openly singled out by a queen, would have
    </p>
    <p>
     scorned to give himself an air for such a reason. But the Baron, deep in
    </p>
    <p>
     intrigue this many a year, looked more profoundly into the possibilities
    </p>
    <p>
     of the future when he kept the young knight at his side.

    <p>
     SUPERSTITIONS
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix was now outside the town and alone in the meadow which bordered
    </p>
    <p>
     the stream; he knelt, and drank from it with the hollow of his hand. He
    </p>
    <p>
     was going to ascend the hill beyond, and had already reached the barrier
    </p>
    <p>
     upon that side, when he recollected that etiquette demanded the presence
    </p>
    <p>
     of the guests at meal-times, and it was now the hour for tea. He
    </p>
    <p>
     hastened back, and found the courtyard of the castle crowded. Within,
    </p>
    <p>
     the staircase leading to the Baroness's chamber (where tea was served)
    </p>
    <p>
     could scarcely be ascended, what with the ladies and their courtiers,
    </p>
    <p>
     the long trains of the serving-women, the pages winding their way in and
    </p>
    <p>
     out, the servants endeavouring to pass, the slender pet greyhounds, the
    </p>
    <p>
     inseparable companions of their mistresses.
    </p>
    <p>
     By degrees, and exercising patience, he gained the upper floor and
    </p>
    <p>
     entered the drawing-room. The Baroness alone sat at the table, the
    </p>
    <p>
     guests wheresoever they chose, or chance carried them; for the most part
    </p>
    <p>
     they stood, or leaned against the recess of the open window. Of tea
    </p>
    <p>
     itself there was none; there had been no tea to be had for love or money
    </p>
    <p>
     these fifty years past, and, indeed, its use would have been forgotten,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the name only survived, had not some small quantities been yet
    </p>
    <p>
     preserved and brought out on rare occasions at the palaces. Instead,
    </p>
    <p>
     there was chicory prepared from the root of the plant, grown for the
    </p>
    <p>
     purpose; fresh milk; fine ale and mead; and wine from Gloucester.
    </p>
    <p>
     Butter, honey, and cake were also on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     The guests helped themselves, or waited till the servants came to them
    </p>
    <p>
     with wooden carved trays. The particular characteristic of tea is the
    </p>
    <p>
     freedom from restraint; it is not considered necessary to sit as at
    </p>
    <p>
     dinner or supper, nor to do as others do; each pleases himself, and
    </p>
    <p>
     there is no ceremony. Yet, although so near Aurora, Felix did not
    </p>
    <p>
     succeed in speaking to her; Durand still engaged her attention whenever
    </p>
    <p>
     other ladies were not talking with her. Felix found himself, exactly as
    </p>
    <p>
     at dinner-time, quite outside the circle. There was a buzz of
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation around, but not a word of it was addressed to him. Dresses
    </p>
    <p>
     brushed against him, but the fair owners were not concerned even to
    </p>
    <p>
     acknowledge his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pushed by the jostling crowd aside from the centre of the floor, Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     presently sat down, glad to rest at last, behind the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forgotten, he forgot; and, looking as it were out of the present in a
    </p>
    <p>
     bitter reverie, scarcely knew where he was, except at moments when he
    </p>
    <p>
     heard the well-known and loved voice of Aurora. A servant after a while
    </p>
    <p>
     came to him with a tray; he took some honey and bread. Almost
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately afterwards another servant came and presented him with a
    </p>
    <p>
     plate, on which was a cup of wine, saying, "With my lady's loving
    </p>
    <p>
     wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
     As in duty bound, he rose and bowed to the Baroness; she smiled and
    </p>
    <p>
     nodded; the circle which had looked to see who was thus honoured, turned
    </p>
    <p>
     aside again, not recognising him. To send a guest a plate with wine or
    </p>
    <p>
     food is the highest mark of esteem, and this plate in especial was of
    </p>
    <p>
     almost priceless value, as Felix saw when his confusion had abated. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was of the ancient china, now not to be found in even the houses of the
    </p>
    <p>
     great.
    </p>
    <p>
     In all that kingdom but five perfect plates were known to exist, and two
    </p>
    <p>
     of these were at the palace. They are treasured as heirlooms, and, if
    </p>
    <p>
     ever broken, can never be replaced. The very fragments are rare; they
    </p>
    <p>
     are often set in panels, and highly prized. The Baroness, glancing round
    </p>
    <p>
     her court, had noticed at last the young man sitting in the obscure
    </p>
    <p>
     corner behind the door; she remembered, not without some twinge of
    </p>
    <p>
     conscience, that his house was their ancient ally and sworn
    </p>
    <p>
     hearth-friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew, far better than the Baron, how deeply her daughter loved him;
    </p>
    <p>
     better, perhaps, even than Aurora herself. She, too, naturally hoped a
    </p>
    <p>
     higher alliance for Aurora; yet she was a true woman, and her heart was
    </p>
    <p>
     stronger than her ambition. The trifle of the wine was, of course,
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing; but it was open and marked recognition. She expected that Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     (after his wont in former times, before love or marriage was thought of
    </p>
    <p>
     for Aurora) would have come upon this distinct invitation, and taken his
    </p>
    <p>
     stand behind her, after the custom. But as he did not come, fresh guests
    </p>
    <p>
     and the duties of hospitality distracted her attention, and she again
    </p>
    <p>
     forgot him.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was, indeed, more hurt than pleased with the favour that had been
    </p>
    <p>
     shown him; it seemed to him (though really prompted by the kindest
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling) like a bone cast at a dog. He desired to be so regarded that no
    </p>
    <p>
     special mark of favour should be needed. It simply increased his
    </p>
    <p>
     discontent. The evening wore on, the supper began; how weary it seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to him, that long and jovial supper, with the ale that ran in a
    </p>
    <p>
     continual stream, the wine that ceaselessly circled round, the jokes,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bustle, and laughter, the welcome to guests arriving; the cards, and
    </p>
    <p>
     chess, and games that succeeded it, the drinking, and drinking, and
    </p>
    <p>
     drinking, till the ladies again left; then drinking yet more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
     He slipped away at the first opportunity, and having first strolled to
    </p>
    <p>
     and fro on the bowling green, wet with dew, at the rear of the castle,
    </p>
    <p>
     asked for his bedroom. It was some time before he could get attended to;
    </p>
    <p>
     he stood alone at the foot of the staircase while others went first
    </p>
    <p>
     (their small coins bought them attention), till at last a lamp was
    </p>
    <p>
     brought to him, and his chamber named. This chamber, such as it was, was
    </p>
    <p>
     the only pleasure, and that a melancholy one, he had had that day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though overflowing with guests, so that the most honoured visitors could
    </p>
    <p>
     not be accommodated within the castle, and only the ladies could find
    </p>
    <p>
     sleeping room there, yet the sacred law of honour, the pledge of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hearth-friend passed three generations ago, secured him this privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hearth-friend must sleep within, if a king were sent without.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver, of course, would occupy the same room, but he was drinking and
    </p>
    <p>
     shouting a song below, so that for a while Felix had the chamber to
    </p>
    <p>
     himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     It pleased him, because it was the room in which he had always slept
    </p>
    <p>
     when he visited the place from a boy, when, half afraid and yet
    </p>
    <p>
     determined to venture, he had first come through the lonely forest
    </p>
    <p>
     alone. How well he remembered that first time! the autumn sunshine on
    </p>
    <p>
     the stubble at Old House, and the red and brown leaves of the forest as
    </p>
    <p>
     he entered; how he entered on foot, and twice turned back, and twice
    </p>
    <p>
     adventured again, till he got so deep into the forest that it seemed as
    </p>
    <p>
     far to return as to advance. How he started at the sudden bellow of two
    </p>
    <p>
     stags, and the clatter of their horns as they fought in the brake close
    </p>
    <p>
     by, and how beautiful the castle looked when presently he emerged from
    </p>
    <p>
     the bushes and looked down upon it!
    </p>
    <p>
     This was the very room he slept in; the Baroness, mother-like, came to
    </p>
    <p>
     see that he was comfortable. Here he had slept every time since; here he
    </p>
    <p>
     had listened in the early morning for Aurora's footfall as she passed
    </p>
    <p>
     his door, for the ladies rose earlier than did the men. He now sat down
    </p>
    <p>
     by the open window; it was a brilliant moonlight night, warm and
    </p>
    <p>
     delicious, and the long-drawn note of the nightingale came across the
    </p>
    <p>
     gardens from the hawthorn bushes without the inner stockade. To the left
    </p>
    <p>
     he could see the line of the hills, to the right the forest; all was
    </p>
    <p>
     quiet there, but every now and then the sound of a ballad came round the
    </p>
    <p>
     castle, a sound without recognizable words, inarticulate merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
     If he started upon the hazardous voyage he contemplated, and for which
    </p>
    <p>
     he had been so long preparing, should he ever sleep there again, so near
    </p>
    <p>
     the one he loved? Was it not better to be poor and despised, but near
    </p>
    <p>
     her, than to attempt such an expedition, especially as the chances (as
    </p>
    <p>
     his common sense told him) were all against him? Yet he could not stay;
    </p>
    <p>
     he must do it, and he tried to stifle the doubt which insisted upon
    </p>
    <p>
     arising in his mind. Then he recurred to Durand; he remembered that not
    </p>
    <p>
     once on that day had he exchanged one single word, beyond the first and
    </p>
    <p>
     ordinary salutation, with Aurora.
    </p>
    <p>
     Might she not, had she chosen, have arranged a moment's interview? Might
    </p>
    <p>
     she not easily have given him an opportunity? Was it not clear that she
    </p>
    <p>
     was ashamed of her girlish fancy for a portionless and despised youth?
    </p>
    <p>
     If so, was it worth while to go upon so strange an enterprise for her
    </p>
    <p>
     sake? But if so, also, was life worth living, and might he not as well
    </p>
    <p>
     go and seek destruction?
    </p>
    <p>
     While this conflict of feeling was proceeding, he chanced to look
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the table upon which he had carelessly placed his lamp, and
    </p>
    <p>
     observed, what in his agitated state of mind he had previously
    </p>
    <p>
     overlooked, a small roll of manuscript tied round with silk. Curious in
    </p>
    <p>
     books, he undid the fastening, and opened the volume. There was not much
    </p>
    <p>
     writing, but many singular diagrams, and signs arranged in circles. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was, in fact, a book of magic, written at the dictation, as the preface
    </p>
    <p>
     stated, of one who had been for seven years a slave among the Romany.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had been captured, and forced to work for the tent to which his
    </p>
    <p>
     owners belonged. He had witnessed their worship and their sorceries; he
    </p>
    <p>
     had seen the sacrifice to the full moon, their chief goddess, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     wild extravagances with which it was accompanied. He had learnt some few
    </p>
    <p>
     of their signs, and, upon escaping, had reproduced them from memory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some were engraved on the stones set in their rings; some were carved on
    </p>
    <p>
     wooden tablets, some drawn with ink on parchment; but, with all, their
    </p>
    <p>
     procedure seemed to be the repetition of certain verses, and then a
    </p>
    <p>
     steady gaze upon the picture. Presently they became filled with rapture,
    </p>
    <p>
     uttered what sounded as the wildest ravings, and (their women
    </p>
    <p>
     especially) prophesied of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few of the signs he understood the meaning of, but the others he owned
    </p>
    <p>
     were unknown to him. At the end of the book were several pages of
    </p>
    <p>
     commentary, describing the demons believed in and worshipped by the
    </p>
    <p>
     Romany, demons which haunted the woods and hills, and against which it
    </p>
    <p>
     was best to be provided with amulets blessed by the holy fathers of St.
    </p>
    <p>
     Augustine. Such demons stole on the hunter at noonday, and, alarmed at
    </p>
    <p>
     the sudden appearance, upon turning his head (for demons invariably
    </p>
    <p>
     approach from behind, and their presence is indicated by a shudder in
    </p>
    <p>
     the back), he toppled into pits hidden by fern, and was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, in the shape of a dog, they ran between the traveller's legs; or as
    </p>
    <p>
     woman, with tempting caresses, lured him from the way at nightfall into
    </p>
    <p>
     the leafy recesses, and then instantaneously changing into vast bat-like
    </p>
    <p>
     forms, fastened on his throat and sucked his blood. The terrible screams
    </p>
    <p>
     of such victims had often been heard by the warders at the outposts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some were invisible, and yet slew the unwary by descending unseen upon
    </p>
    <p>
     him, and choking him with a pressure as if the air had suddenly become
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
     But none of these were, perhaps, so much to be dreaded as the
    </p>
    <p>
     sweetly-formed and graceful ladies of the fern. These were creatures,
    </p>
    <p>
     not of flesh and blood, and yet not incorporeal like the demons, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     were they dangerous to the physical man, doing no bodily injury. The
    </p>
    <p>
     harm they did was by fascinating the soul so that it revolted from all
    </p>
    <p>
     religion and all the rites of the Church. Once resigned to the caress of
    </p>
    <p>
     the fern-woman, the unfortunate was lured farther and farther from the
    </p>
    <p>
     haunts of men, until at last he wandered into the unknown forest, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was never seen again. These creatures were usually found among the brake
    </p>
    <p>
     fern, nude, but the lower limbs and body hidden by the green fronds,
    </p>
    <p>
     their white arms and shoulders alone visible, and their golden hair
    </p>
    <p>
     aglow with the summer sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Demons there were, too, of the streams, and demons dwelling in the midst
    </p>
    <p>
     of the hills; demons that could travel only in the moonbeams, and others
    </p>
    <p>
     that floated before the stormy winds and hurled the wretched wanderer to
    </p>
    <p>
     destruction, or crushed him with the overthrown trees. In proof of this
    </p>
    <p>
     the monk asked the reader if he had not heard of huge boughs falling
    </p>
    <p>
     from trees without visible cause, suddenly and without warning, and even
    </p>
    <p>
     of trees themselves in full foliage, in calm weather, toppling with a
    </p>
    <p>
     crash, to the imminent danger or the death of those who happened to be
    </p>
    <p>
     passing. Let all these purchase the amulets of St. Augustine, concluded
    </p>
    <p>
     the writer, who it appeared was a monk in whose monastery the escaped
    </p>
    <p>
     prisoner had taken refuge, and who had written down his relation and
    </p>
    <p>
     copied his rude sketches.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix pored over the strange diagrams, striving to understand the hidden
    </p>
    <p>
     meaning; some of them he thought were alchemical signs, and related to
    </p>
    <p>
     the making of gold, especially as the prisoner stated the Romany
    </p>
    <p>
     possessed much more of that metal in the tents than he had seen in the
    </p>
    <p>
     palaces of our kings. Whether they had a gold mine from whence they drew
    </p>
    <p>
     it, or whether they had the art of transmutation, he knew not, but he
    </p>
    <p>
     had heard allusions to the wealth in the mountain of the apple trees,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he supposed to be a mystical phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Felix at last looked up, the lamp was low, the moonbeams had
    </p>
    <p>
     entered and fell upon the polished floor, and from the window he could
    </p>
    <p>
     see a long white ghostly line of mist where a streamlet ran at the base
    </p>
    <p>
     of the slope by the forest. The songs were silent; there was no sound
    </p>
    <p>
     save the distant neigh of a horse and the heavy tramp of a guest coming
    </p>
    <p>
     along the gallery. Half bewildered by poring over the magic scroll, full
    </p>
    <p>
     of the signs and the demons, and still with a sense of injury and
    </p>
    <p>
     jealousy cankering his heart, Felix retired to his couch, and, weary
    </p>
    <p>
     beyond measure, instantly fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     In his unsettled state of mind it did not once occur to him to ask
    </p>
    <p>
     himself how the manuscript came to be upon his table. Rare as they were,
    </p>
    <p>
     books were not usually put upon the tables of guests, and at an ordinary
    </p>
    <p>
     time he would certainly have thought it peculiar. The fact was, that
    </p>
    <p>
     Aurora, whom all day he had inwardly accused of forgetting him, had
    </p>
    <p>
     placed it there for him with her own hands. She, too, was curious in
    </p>
    <p>
     books and fond of study. She had very recently bought the volume from a
    </p>
    <p>
     merchant who had come thus far, and who valued it the least of all his
    </p>
    <p>
     wares.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew that Felix had read and re-read every other scrap of writing
    </p>
    <p>
     there was in the castle, and thought that this strange book might
    </p>
    <p>
     interest him, giving, as it did, details of those powers of the air in
    </p>
    <p>
     which almost all fully believed. Unconscious of this attention, Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     fell asleep, angry and bitter against her. When, half an hour
    </p>
    <p>
     afterwards, Oliver blundered into the room, a little unsteady on his
    </p>
    <p>
     legs, notwithstanding his mighty strength, he picked up the roll,
    </p>
    <p>
     glanced at it, flung it down with contempt, and without a minute's delay
    </p>
    <p>
     sought and obtained slumber.

     CHAPTER X

    <p>
     THE FEAST
    </p>
    <p>
     At ten in the morning next day the feast began with a drama from
    </p>
    <p>
     Sophocles, which was performed in the open air. The theatre was in the
    </p>
    <p>
     gardens between the wall and the inner stockade; the spectators sat on
    </p>
    <p>
     the slope, tier above tier; the actors appeared upon a green terrace
    </p>
    <p>
     below, issuing from an arbour and passing off behind a thick box-hedge
    </p>
    <p>
     on the other side of the terrace. There was no scenery whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aurora had selected the Antigone. There were not many dramatists from
    </p>
    <p>
     whom to choose, for so many English writers, once famous, had dropped
    </p>
    <p>
     out of knowledge and disappeared. Yet some of the far more ancient Greek
    </p>
    <p>
     and Roman classics remained because they contained depth and originality
    </p>
    <p>
     of ideas in small compass. They had been copied in manuscripts by
    </p>
    <p>
     thoughtful men from the old printed books before they mouldered away,
    </p>
    <p>
     and their manuscripts being copied again, these works were handed down.
    </p>
    <p>
     The books which came into existence with printing had never been copied
    </p>
    <p>
     by the pen, and had consequently nearly disappeared. Extremely long and
    </p>
    <p>
     diffuse, it was found, too, that so many of them were but enlargements
    </p>
    <p>
     of ideas or sentiments which had been expressed in a few words by the
    </p>
    <p>
     classics. It is so much easier to copy an epigram of two lines than a
    </p>
    <p>
     printed book of hundreds of pages, and hence it was that Sophocles had
    </p>
    <p>
     survived while much more recent writers had been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     From a translation Aurora had arranged several of his dramas. Antigone
    </p>
    <p>
     was her favourite, and she wished Felix to see it. In some indefinable
    </p>
    <p>
     manner the spirit of the ancient Greeks seemed to her in accord with the
    </p>
    <p>
     times, for men had or appeared to have so little control over their own
    </p>
    <p>
     lives that they might well imagine themselves overruled by destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
     Communication between one place and another was difficult, the division
    </p>
    <p>
     of society into castes, and the iron tyranny of arms, prevented the
    </p>
    <p>
     individual from making any progress in lifting himself out of the groove
    </p>
    <p>
     in which he was born, except by the rarest opportunity, unless specially
    </p>
    <p>
     favoured by fortune. As men were born so they lived; they could not
    </p>
    <p>
     advance, and when this is the case the idea of Fate is always
    </p>
    <p>
     predominant. The workings of destiny, the Irresistible overpowering both
    </p>
    <p>
     the good and the evil-disposed, such as were traced in the Greek drama,
    </p>
    <p>
     were paralleled in the lives of many a miserable slave at that day. They
    </p>
    <p>
     were forced to endure, for there was no possibility of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aurora saw this and felt it deeply; ever anxious as she was for the good
    </p>
    <p>
     of all, she saw the sadness that reigned even in the midst of the fresh
    </p>
    <p>
     foliage of spring and among the flowers. It was Fate; it was Sophocles.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took the part of the heroine herself, clad in Greek costume; Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     listened and watched, absorbed in his love. Never had that ancient drama
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared so beautiful as then, in the sunlight; the actors stepped upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the daisied sward, and the song of birds was all their music.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the play was still proceeding, those who were to form the usual
    </p>
    <p>
     procession had already been assembling in the court before the castle,
    </p>
    <p>
     and just after noon, to the sound of the trumpet, the Baron, with his
    </p>
    <p>
     youngest son beside him (the eldest was at Court), left the porch,
    </p>
    <p>
     wearing his fur-lined short mantle, his collar, and golden spurs, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the decoration won so many years before; all the insignia of his rank.
    </p>
    <p>
     He walked; his war-horse, fully caparisoned, with axe at the saddle-bow,
    </p>
    <p>
     was led at his right side, and upon the other came a knight carrying the
    </p>
    <p>
     banneret of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gentlemen of the house followed closely, duly marshalled in ranks,
    </p>
    <p>
     and wearing the gayest dress; the leading retainers fully armed, brought
    </p>
    <p>
     up the rear. Immediately upon issuing from the gate of the wall, the
    </p>
    <p>
     procession was met and surrounded by the crowd, carrying large branches
    </p>
    <p>
     of may in bloom, flowers, and green willow boughs. The flowers they
    </p>
    <p>
     flung before him on the ground; the branches they bore with them,
    </p>
    <p>
     chanting old verses in honour of the family. The route was through the
    </p>
    <p>
     town, where the Baron stopped at the door of the Court House, and
    </p>
    <p>
     proclaimed a free pardon to all serfs (who were released within a few
    </p>
    <p>
     minutes) not guilty of the heavier crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thence he went to the pasture just beyond, carefully mown close and
    </p>
    <p>
     swept for the purpose, where the May-pole stood, wreathed with flowers
    </p>
    <p>
     and green branches. Beneath it he deposited a bag of money for
    </p>
    <p>
     distribution upon a carved butt placed there, the signal that the games
    </p>
    <p>
     were open. Instantly the fiddles began to play, and the feast really
    </p>
    <p>
     commenced. At the inns ale was served out freely (at the Baron's
    </p>
    <p>
     charge), carts, too, came down from the castle laden with ale and cooked
    </p>
    <p>
     provisions. Wishing them joy, the Baron returned by the same road to the
    </p>
    <p>
     castle, where dinner was already served in the hall and the sheds that
    </p>
    <p>
     had been erected to enlarge the accommodation.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the afternoon there were foot-races, horse-races, and leaping
    </p>
    <p>
     competitions, and the dances about the May-pole were prolonged far into
    </p>
    <p>
     the night. The second day, early in the morning, the barriers were
    </p>
    <p>
     opened, and trials of skill with the blunt sword, jousting with the
    </p>
    <p>
     blunt lance at the quintain, and wrestling began, and continued almost
    </p>
    <p>
     till sunset. Tournament with sharpened lance or sword, when the
    </p>
    <p>
     combatants fight with risk of serious wounds, can take place only in the
    </p>
    <p>
     presence of the Prince or his deputy. But in these conflicts
    </p>
    <p>
     sufficiently severe blows were given to disable the competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the third day there was a set battle in the morning between fifteen
    </p>
    <p>
     men on each side, armed with the usual buckler or small shield, and
    </p>
    <p>
     stout single-sticks instead of swords. This combat excited more interest
    </p>
    <p>
     than all the duels that had preceded it; the crowd almost broke down the
    </p>
    <p>
     barriers, and the cheering and cries of encouragement could be heard
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the hills. Thrice the combatants rested from the engagement, and
    </p>
    <p>
     thrice at the trumpet call started again to meet each other, at least
    </p>
    <p>
     those who had sustained the first onslaught.
    </p>
    <p>
     Blood, indeed, was not shed (for the iron morions saved their skulls),
    </p>
    <p>
     but nearly half of the number required assistance to reach the tents
    </p>
    <p>
     pitched for their use. Then came more feasting, the final dinner
    </p>
    <p>
     prolonged till six in the evening, when the company, constantly rising
    </p>
    <p>
     from their seats, cheered the Baron, and drank to the prosperity of the
    </p>
    <p>
     house. After the horn blew at six, the guests who had come from a
    </p>
    <p>
     distance rapidly dispersed (their horses were already waiting), for they
    </p>
    <p>
     were anxious to pass the fifteen miles of forest before nightfall. Those
    </p>
    <p>
     on foot, and those ladies who had come in covered waggons, stayed till
    </p>
    <p>
     next morning, as they could not travel so speedily. By seven or eight
    </p>
    <p>
     the castle courtyard was comparatively empty, and the Baron, weary from
    </p>
    <p>
     the mere bodily efforts of saying farewell to so many, had flung himself
    </p>
    <p>
     at full length on a couch in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the whole of this time Felix had not obtained a single moment
    </p>
    <p>
     with Aurora; her time, when not occupied in attending to the guests, was
    </p>
    <p>
     always claimed by Lord Durand. Felix, after the short-lived but pure
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasure he had enjoyed in watching her upon the grass-grown stage, had
    </p>
    <p>
     endured three days of misery. He was among the crowd, he was in the
    </p>
    <p>
     castle itself, he sat at table with the most honoured visitors, yet he
    </p>
    <p>
     was distinct from all. There was no sympathy between them and him. The
    </p>
    <p>
     games, the dancing, the feasting and laughter, the ceaseless singing and
    </p>
    <p>
     shouting, and jovial jostling, jarred upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boundless interest the people took in the combats, and especially
    </p>
    <p>
     that of the thirty, seemed to him a strange and inexplicable phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
     It did not excite him in the least; he could turn his back upon it
    </p>
    <p>
     without hesitation. He would, indeed, have left the crowd, and spent the
    </p>
    <p>
     day in the forest, or on the hills, but he could not leave Aurora. He
    </p>
    <p>
     must be near her; he must see her, though he was miserable. Now he
    </p>
    <p>
     feared that the last moment would come, and that he should not exchange
    </p>
    <p>
     a word with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     He could not, with any show of pretext, prolong his stay beyond the
    </p>
    <p>
     sunset; all were already gone, with the exceptions mentioned. It would
    </p>
    <p>
     be against etiquette to remain longer, unless specially invited, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     was not specially invited. Yet he lingered, and lingered. His horse was
    </p>
    <p>
     ready below; the groom, weary of holding the bridle, had thrown it over
    </p>
    <p>
     an iron hook in the yard, and gone about other business. The sun
    </p>
    <p>
     perceptibly declined, and the shadow of the beeches of the forest began
    </p>
    <p>
     to descend the grassy slope. Still he stayed, restlessly moving, now in
    </p>
    <p>
     the dining chamber, now in the hall, now at the foot of the staircase,
    </p>
    <p>
     with an unpleasant feeling that the servants looked at him curiously,
    </p>
    <p>
     and were watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver had gone long since, riding with his new friend Lord Durand; they
    </p>
    <p>
     must by now be half-way through the forest. Forced by the inexorable
    </p>
    <p>
     flight of time, he put his foot upon the staircase to go up to the
    </p>
    <p>
     drawing-room and bid farewell to the Baroness. He ascended it, step by
    </p>
    <p>
     step, as a condemned person goes to his doom. He stayed to look out of
    </p>
    <p>
     the open windows as he went by; anything to excuse delay to himself. He
    </p>
    <p>
     reached the landing at last, and had taken two steps towards the door,
    </p>
    <p>
     when Aurora's maid, who had been waiting there an hour or more for the
    </p>
    <p>
     opportunity, brushed past him, and whispered, "The Rose arbour."
    </p>
    <p>
     Without a word he turned, hastened down the stairs, ran through the
    </p>
    <p>
     castle yard, out at the gate, and, entering the gardens between the wall
    </p>
    <p>
     and the inner stockade, made for the arbour on the terrace where the
    </p>
    <p>
     drama had been enacted. Aurora was not there; but as he looked round,
    </p>
    <p>
     disappointed, she came from the Filbert walk, and, taking his arm, led
    </p>
    <p>
     him to the arbour. They sat down without a word. In a moment she placed
    </p>
    <p>
     her head upon his shoulder; he did not respond. She put her arm (how
    </p>
    <p>
     warm it felt!) about his neck; he yielded stiffly and ungraciously to
    </p>
    <p>
     the pressure; she drew down his head, and kissed him. His lips touched
    </p>
    <p>
     but did not press hers; they met, but did not join. In his sullen and
    </p>
    <p>
     angry silence he would not look. She drew still nearer, and whispered
    </p>
    <p>
     his name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he broke out: he pushed her away; his petty jealousy and injured
    </p>
    <p>
     self-esteem poured out upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am not the heir to an earldom," he said; "I do not ride with a score
    </p>
    <p>
     of gentlemen at my back. They have some wonderful diamonds, have they
    </p>
    <p>
     not--Countess?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Felix!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is no use. Yes, your voice is sweet, I know. But you, all of you,
    </p>
    <p>
     despise me. I am nothing, no one!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You are all, everything, to me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You were with--with Durand the whole time."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I could not help myself."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not help yourself! Do you think I believe that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Felix, dear. I tell you I could not help myself; I could not, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
     You do not know all--"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, probably not. I do not know the terms of the marriage contract."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Felix, there is no such thing. Why, what has come to you? How pale you
    </p>
    <p>
     look! Sit down!" for he had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I cannot, Aurora, dear; I cannot! Oh, what shall I do? I love you so!"
    </p>

     CHAPTER XI
    </head>
    <p>
     AURORA
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix fell on the seat beside her, burying his face in the folds of her
    </p>
    <p>
     dress; he sobbed, not with tears, but choking passion. She held him to
    </p>
    <p>
     her heart as if he had been a child, stroking his hair and kissing it,
    </p>
    <p>
     whispering to him, assuring him that her love was his, that she was
    </p>
    <p>
     unchanged. She told him that it was not her fault. A little while before
    </p>
    <p>
     the feast the Baron had suddenly broken out into a fit of temper, such
    </p>
    <p>
     as she had never seen him indulge in previously; the cause was pressure
    </p>
    <p>
     put upon him by his creditors. Unpleasant truths had escaped him;
    </p>
    <p>
     amongst the rest, his dislike, his positive disapproval of the tacit
    </p>
    <p>
     engagement they had entered into.
    </p>
    <p>
     He declared that if the least outward sign of it appeared before the
    </p>
    <p>
     guests that were expected, he would order Felix to leave the place, and
    </p>
    <p>
     cancel the hearth-friendship, no matter what the consequence. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     clear that he was set upon a wealthy and powerful alliance for her; that
    </p>
    <p>
     the Earl was either coming, or would send his son, he knew; and he knew
    </p>
    <p>
     that nothing so repels a possible suitor as the rumour that the lady has
    </p>
    <p>
     a previous engagement. In short, he made it a condition of Felix's
    </p>
    <p>
     presence being tolerated at all, that Aurora should carefully abstain
    </p>
    <p>
     from showing the slightest attention to him; that she should ignore his
    </p>
    <p>
     existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor could she prevent Durand following her without a marked refusal to
    </p>
    <p>
     listen to his conversation, a refusal which would most certainly at once
    </p>
    <p>
     have brought about the dreaded explosion. She thought it better, under
    </p>
    <p>
     the circumstances, to preserve peace, lest intercourse between her and
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix should be entirely broken off for ever. This was the secret
    </p>
    <p>
     history of the apparent indifference and neglect which had so deeply
    </p>
    <p>
     hurt him. The explanation, accompanied as it was with so many tender
    </p>
    <p>
     expressions and caresses, soothed him; he returned her kisses and became
    </p>
    <p>
     calmer. He could not doubt her, for in his heart he had suspected
    </p>
    <p>
     something of the kind long since.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet it was not so much the explanation itself, nor even the love she
    </p>
    <p>
     poured upon him, as the mere fact of her presence so near that brought
    </p>
    <p>
     him to himself. The influence of her steadfast nature, of her clear,
    </p>
    <p>
     broad, straightforward view of things, the decision of her character,
    </p>
    <p>
     the high, unselfish motives which animated her, all together supplied
    </p>
    <p>
     that which was wanting in himself. His indecision, his too
    </p>
    <p>
     impressionable disposition, which checked and stayed the force of his
    </p>
    <p>
     talent, and counteracted the determination of a naturally iron will;
    </p>
    <p>
     these, as it were, were relieved; in a word, with her he became himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     How many times he had told her as much! How many times she had replied
    </p>
    <p>
     that it was not herself, but that in which she believed, that was the
    </p>
    <p>
     real cause of this feeling! It was that ancient and true religion; the
    </p>
    <p>
     religion of the primitive church, as she found it in the fragments of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Scriptures that had come down from the ancients.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aurora had learnt this faith from childhood; it was, indeed, a tradition
    </p>
    <p>
     of the house preserved unbroken these hundred years in the midst of the
    </p>
    <p>
     jarring creeds, whose disciples threatened and destroyed each other. On
    </p>
    <p>
     the one hand, the gorgeous rite of the Vice-Pope, with the priests and
    </p>
    <p>
     the monks, claimed dominion, and really held a large share, both over
    </p>
    <p>
     the body and the soul; on the other, the Leaguers, with their bold,
    </p>
    <p>
     harsh, and flowerless creed, were equally over-bearing and equally
    </p>
    <p>
     bigoted. Around them the Bushmen wandered without a god; the Romany
    </p>
    <p>
     called upon the full moon. Within courts and cities the gay and the
    </p>
    <p>
     learned alike mocked at all faith, and believed in gold alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cruelty reigned everywhere; mercy, except in the name of honour, there
    </p>
    <p>
     was none; humanity was unknown. A few, a very few only, had knowledge of
    </p>
    <p>
     or held to the leading tenets, which, in the time of the ancients, were
    </p>
    <p>
     assented to by everyone, such as the duty of humanity to all, the duty
    </p>
    <p>
     of saving and protecting life, of kindness and gentleness. These few,
    </p>
    <p>
     with their pastors, simple and unassuming, had no power or influence;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet they existed here and there, a living protest against the
    </p>
    <p>
     lawlessness and brutality of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Among these the house of Thyma had in former days been conspicuous, but
    </p>
    <p>
     of late years the barons of Thyma had, more from policy than from aught
    </p>
    <p>
     else, rather ignored their ancestral faith, leaning towards the League,
    </p>
    <p>
     which was then powerful in that kingdom. To have acted otherwise would
    </p>
    <p>
     have been to exclude himself from all appointments. But Aurora, learning
    </p>
    <p>
     the old faith at her mother's knee, had become too deeply imbued with
    </p>
    <p>
     its moral beauty to consent to this course. By degrees, as she grew up,
    </p>
    <p>
     it became in her a passion; more than a faith, a passion; the object of
    </p>
    <p>
     her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     A girl, indeed, can do but little in our iron days, but that little she
    </p>
    <p>
     did. The chapel beside the castle, long since fallen to decay, was, at
    </p>
    <p>
     her earnest request, repaired; a pastor came and remained as chaplain,
    </p>
    <p>
     and services, of the simplest kind, but serious and full of meaning,
    </p>
    <p>
     took place twice a week. To these she drew as many as possible of the
    </p>
    <p>
     inhabitants of the enclosure; some even came from afar once now and then
    </p>
    <p>
     to attend them. Correspondence was carried on with the remnant of the
    </p>
    <p>
     faith.
    </p>
    <p>
     That no one might plead ignorance (for there was up to the date no
    </p>
    <p>
     written record) Aurora set herself the task of reducing the traditions
    </p>
    <p>
     which had been handed down to writing. When the manuscript was at last
    </p>
    <p>
     completed it occupied her months to transcribe copies of it for
    </p>
    <p>
     circulation; and she still continued to make copies, which were sent by
    </p>
    <p>
     messengers and by the travelling merchants to the markets, and even
    </p>
    <p>
     across the sea. Apart from its intrinsically elevating character, the
    </p>
    <p>
     mere mental labour expended on this work had undoubtedly strengthened a
    </p>
    <p>
     naturally fine intellect. As she said, it was the faith, the hope that
    </p>
    <p>
     that faith would one day be recognised, which gave her so much influence
    </p>
    <p>
     over others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this one thing only they differed; Felix did not oppose, did not
    </p>
    <p>
     even argue, he was simply untouched. It was not that he believed in
    </p>
    <p>
     anything else, nor that he doubted; he was merely indifferent. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     too great a natural aptitude for the physical sciences, and too clear a
    </p>
    <p>
     mind, to accept that which was taught by the one or the other of the two
    </p>
    <p>
     chief opposing parties. Nor could he join in the ridicule and derision
    </p>
    <p>
     of the gay courtiers, for the mystery of existence had impressed him
    </p>
    <p>
     deeply while wandering alone in the forest. But he stood aloof; he
    </p>
    <p>
     smiled and listened, unconvinced; like the wild creatures of the forest,
    </p>
    <p>
     he had no ears for these matters. He loved Aurora, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
     But he felt the influence just the same; with all his powers of mind and
    </p>
    <p>
     contempt of superstitions in others, he could not at times shake off the
    </p>
    <p>
     apprehensions aroused by untoward omens, as when he stepped upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     adder in the woods. Aurora knew nothing of such things; her faith was
    </p>
    <p>
     clear and bright like a star; nothing could alarm her, or bring
    </p>
    <p>
     uneasiness of mind. This beautiful calm, not cold, but glowing with hope
    </p>
    <p>
     and love, soothed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     That evening, with her hope and love, with her message of trust, she
    </p>
    <p>
     almost persuaded him. He almost turned to what she had so long taught.
    </p>
    <p>
     He almost repented of that hardness of heart, that unutterable distance,
    </p>
    <p>
     as it were, between him and other men, which lay at the bottom of his
    </p>
    <p>
     proposed expedition. He opened his lips to confess to her his purpose,
    </p>
    <p>
     and had he done so assuredly she would have persuaded him from it. But
    </p>
    <p>
     in the very act of speaking, he hesitated. It was characteristic of him
    </p>
    <p>
     to do so. Whether she instinctively felt that there was something
    </p>
    <p>
     concealed from her, or guessed that the discontent she knew he had so
    </p>
    <p>
     long endured was coming to a point, or feared lest what she had told him
    </p>
    <p>
     might drive him to some ill-considered act, she begged him with all the
    </p>
    <p>
     power of her love to do nothing hasty, or in despair, nothing that would
    </p>
    <p>
     separate them. He threw his arms around her, he pressed her closely to
    </p>
    <p>
     him, he trembled with the passion and the struggle within him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My lady calls for you, Mademoiselle," said a voice; it was Aurora's
    </p>
    <p>
     maid who had kept watch. "She has asked for you some time since. Someone
    </p>
    <p>
     is coming into the garden!"
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no help for it; Aurora kissed him, and was gone before he
    </p>
    <p>
     could come to himself. How long the interview had lasted (time flies
    </p>
    <p>
     swiftly in such sweet intercourse), or how long he sat there after she
    </p>
    <p>
     left, he could not tell; but when he went out already the dusk was
    </p>
    <p>
     gathering, the sun had gone down, and in the east the as yet pale orb of
    </p>
    <p>
     the moon was rising over the hills. As if in a dream he walked with
    </p>
    <p>
     unsteady steps to the castle stable; his horse had been put back, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the grooms suggested to him that it was better not to attempt the forest
    </p>
    <p>
     at night. But he was determined; he gave them all the coin he had about
    </p>
    <p>
     him, it was not much, but more than they had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
     They ran beside him to the barrier; advising him as they ran, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     would go, to string his bow and loosen an arrow in the girdle, and above
    </p>
    <p>
     all, not to loiter, or let his horse walk, but to keep him at as sharp a
    </p>
    <p>
     trot as he could. The fact that so many wealthy persons had assembled at
    </p>
    <p>
     the castle for the feast would be sure to be known to the banditti (the
    </p>
    <p>
     outlaws of the cities and the escaped serfs). They were certain to be on
    </p>
    <p>
     the look out for travellers; let him beware.
    </p>
    <p>
     His ears tingled and his head felt hot, as if the blood had rushed into
    </p>
    <p>
     it (it was the violence of the emotion that he had felt), as he rode
    </p>
    <p>
     from the barrier, hearing, and yet without conscious knowledge of what
    </p>
    <p>
     they said. They watched him up the slope, and saw him disappear from
    </p>
    <p>
     sight under the dark beeches of the forest.

    </head>
    <p>
     NIGHT IN THE FOREST
    </p>
    <p>
     At first Felix rode quickly, but his horse stumbling, though accustomed
    </p>
    <p>
     to the woods, warned him to be more careful. The passage of so many
    </p>
    <p>
     horsemen in the last few days had cut up and destroyed the track, which
    </p>
    <p>
     was nothing but a green path, and the covered waggons had of course
    </p>
    <p>
     assisted in rendering it rough and broken. He therefore rode slowly, and
    </p>
    <p>
     giving his horse his head, he picked his way of his own accord at the
    </p>
    <p>
     side of the road, often brushing against the underwood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, indeed, absorbed by the feelings which had almost mastered him in
    </p>
    <p>
     the arbour, and thinking of Aurora, he forgot where he was, till the
    </p>
    <p>
     dismal howling of wood-dogs deep in the forest woke him. It was almost
    </p>
    <p>
     pitch dark under the tall beeches, the highest of the trees preventing
    </p>
    <p>
     the beams of the moon from illuminating the path till later in the
    </p>
    <p>
     night. Like a curtain the thick foliage above shut out the sky, so that
    </p>
    <p>
     no star was visible. When the wood-dogs ceased there was no sound beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     the light fall of the horse's hoofs as he walked upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Darkness and silence prevailed; he could see nothing. He spoke to his
    </p>
    <p>
     horse and patted his neck; he stepped a little faster and lifted his
    </p>
    <p>
     head, which he had held low as if making his way by scent.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gloom weighed upon him, unhappy as he was. Often as he had
    </p>
    <p>
     voluntarily sought the loneliness of the woods, now in this state of
    </p>
    <p>
     mind, it oppressed him; he remembered that beyond the beeches the ground
    </p>
    <p>
     was open and cleared by a forest fire, and began to be anxious to reach
    </p>
    <p>
     it. It seemed an hour, but it really was only a few minutes, when the
    </p>
    <p>
     beeches became thinner and wider apart, the foliage above ceased, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the stars shone. Before him was the open space he had desired, sloping
    </p>
    <p>
     to the right hand, the tall grass grey-green in the moonlight, and near
    </p>
    <p>
     at hand sparkling with dew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Amongst it stood the crooked and charred stems of furze with which it
    </p>
    <p>
     had been covered before the fire passed. A white owl floated rather than
    </p>
    <p>
     flew by, following the edge of the forest; from far down the slope came
    </p>
    <p>
     the chattering notes of a brook-sparrow, showing that there was water in
    </p>
    <p>
     the hollow. Some large animal moved into the white mist that hung there
    </p>
    <p>
     and immediately concealed it, like a cloud upon the ground. He was not
    </p>
    <p>
     certain in the dim light, and with so momentary and distant a view, but
    </p>
    <p>
     supposed from its size that it must have been a white or dun wood-cow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ahead, across the open, rose the dark top of the fir trees through which
    </p>
    <p>
     the route ran. Instead of the relief which he had anticipated as he rode
    </p>
    <p>
     towards them, the space clear of trees around seemed to expose him to
    </p>
    <p>
     the full view of all that might be lurking in the forest. As he
    </p>
    <p>
     approached the firs and saw how dark it was beneath them, the shadowy
    </p>
    <p>
     depths suggested uncertain shapes hiding therein, and his memory
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately reverted to the book of magic he had read at the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
     There could not be such things, and yet no one in his heart doubted
    </p>
    <p>
     their existence; deny it as they might with their tongues as they sat at
    </p>
    <p>
     the supper-table and handed round the ale, out of doors in the night,
    </p>
    <p>
     the haste to pass the haunted spot, the bated breath, and the fearful
    </p>
    <p>
     glances cast around, told another tale. He endeavoured to call
    </p>
    <p>
     philosophy to his aid; he remembered, too, how many nights he had spent
    </p>
    <p>
     in the deepest forest without seeing anything, and without even thinking
    </p>
    <p>
     of such matters. He reproved himself for his folly, and asked himself if
    </p>
    <p>
     ever he could hope to be a successful leader of men who started at a
    </p>
    <p>
     shadow. In vain: the tone of his mind had been weakened by the strain it
    </p>
    <p>
     had undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of strengthening him, the teachings of philosophy now seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     cold and feeble, and it occurred to him that possibly the belief of the
    </p>
    <p>
     common people (fully shared by their religious instructors) was just as
    </p>
    <p>
     much entitled to credence as these mere suppositions and theories. The
    </p>
    <p>
     details of the volume recurred to his mind; the accurate description of
    </p>
    <p>
     the demons of the forest and the hill, and especially the horrible
    </p>
    <p>
     vampires enfolding the victim with outstretched wings. In spite of
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, incredulous, yet excited, he pressed his horse to greater
    </p>
    <p>
     speed, though the track was narrow and very much broken under the firs.
    </p>
    <p>
     He obeyed, and trotted, but reluctantly, and needed continual urging.
    </p>
    <p>
     The yellow spark of a glowworm shining by a bush made him set his teeth;
    </p>
    <p>
     trifling and well known as it was, the light suddenly seen thrilled him
    </p>
    <p>
     with the terror of the unexpected. Strange rushings sounded among the
    </p>
    <p>
     fern, as if the wings of a demon brushed it as he travelled. Felix knew
    </p>
    <p>
     that they were caused by rabbits hastening off, or a boar bounding away,
    </p>
    <p>
     yet they increased the feverish excitement with which he was burdened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though dark beneath the firs, it was not like the darkness of the
    </p>
    <p>
     beeches; these trees did not form a perfect canopy overhead everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     In places he could see where a streak of moonlight came aslant through
    </p>
    <p>
     an opening and reached the ground. One such streak fell upon the track
    </p>
    <p>
     ahead; the trees there had decayed and fallen, and a broad band of light
    </p>
    <p>
     lit up the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he approached it and had almost entered, suddenly something shot
    </p>
    <p>
     towards him in the air; a flash, as it were, as if some object had
    </p>
    <p>
     crossed the streak, and was rendered visible for the tenth of a second,
    </p>
    <p>
     like a mote in the sunbeams. At the same instant of time, the horse,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he had pressed to go faster, put his foot into a rut or hole, and
    </p>
    <p>
     stumbled, and Felix was flung so far forward that he only saved himself
    </p>
    <p>
     from being thrown by clinging to his neck. A slight whizzing sound
    </p>
    <p>
     passed over his head, followed immediately by a sharp tap against a tree
    </p>
    <p>
     in his rear.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing happened in the twinkling of an eye, but he recognised the
    </p>
    <p>
     sound; it was the whiz of a crossbow bolt, which had missed his head,
    </p>
    <p>
     and buried its point in a fir. The stumble saved him; the bolt would
    </p>
    <p>
     have struck his head or chest had not the horse gone nearly on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
     The robber had so planned his ambush that his prey should be well seen,
    </p>
    <p>
     distinct in the moonlight, so that his aim might be sure. Recovering
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, the horse, without needing the spur, as if he recognised the
    </p>
    <p>
     danger to his rider, started forward at full speed, and raced,
    </p>
    <p>
     regardless of ruts, along the track. Felix, who had hardly got into his
    </p>
    <p>
     seat again, could for awhile but barely restrain it, so wildly he fled.
    </p>
    <p>
     He must have been carried within a few yards of the bandit, but saw
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing, neither did a second bolt follow him; the crossbow takes time
    </p>
    <p>
     to bend, and if the robber had companions they were differently armed.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was a furlong or more from the spot before he quite realized the
    </p>
    <p>
     danger he had escaped. His bow was unstrung in his hand, his arrows were
    </p>
    <p>
     all in the quiver; thus, had the bolt struck him, even if the wound had
    </p>
    <p>
     not been mortal (as it most likely would have been) he could have made
    </p>
    <p>
     no resistance. How foolish to disregard the warnings of the grooms at
    </p>
    <p>
     the castle! It was now too late; all he could do was to ride. Dreading
    </p>
    <p>
     every moment to be thrown, he pushed on as fast as the horse would go.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no pursuit, and after a mile or so, as he left the firs and
    </p>
    <p>
     entered the ash woods, he slackened somewhat. It was, indeed, necessary,
    </p>
    <p>
     for here the hoofs of preceding horsemen had poached the turf (always
    </p>
    <p>
     damp under ash) into mud. It was less dark, for the boughs of the ashes
    </p>
    <p>
     did not meet above.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he passed, wood-pigeons rose with loud clatterings from their
    </p>
    <p>
     roosting-places, and once or twice he saw in the gloom the fiery
    </p>
    <p>
     phosphoric eye-balls of the grey wood-cats. How gladly he recognised
    </p>
    <p>
     presently the change from trees to bushes, when he rode out from the
    </p>
    <p>
     thick ashes among the low hawthorns, and knew that he was within a mile
    </p>
    <p>
     or so of the South Barrier at home! Already he heard the song of the
    </p>
    <p>
     nightingale, the long note which at night penetrates so far; the
    </p>
    <p>
     nightingale, which loves the hawthorn and the neighbourhood of man.
    </p>
    <p>
     Imperceptibly he increased the speed again; the horse, too, knew that he
    </p>
    <p>
     was nearing home, and responded willingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The track was much broader and fairly good, but he knew that at one spot
    </p>
    <p>
     where it was marshy it must be cut up. There he went at the side, almost
    </p>
    <p>
     brushing a projecting maple bush. Something struck the horse, he fancied
    </p>
    <p>
     the rebound of a bough; he jumped, literally jumped, like a buck, and
    </p>
    <p>
     tore along the road. With one foot out of the stirrup, it was with the
    </p>
    <p>
     utmost difficulty he stuck to his seat; he was not riding, but holding
    </p>
    <p>
     on for a moment or two. Presently recovering from the jolt, he
    </p>
    <p>
     endeavoured to check him, but the bit was of no avail; the animal was
    </p>
    <p>
     beside himself with terror, and raced headlong till they reached the
    </p>
    <p>
     barrier. It was, of course, closed, and the warder was asleep; so that,
    </p>
    <p>
     until he dismounted, and kicked and shouted, no one challenged him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then the warder, spear in hand, appeared with his lantern, but
    </p>
    <p>
     recognising the voice, ran to the gate. Within the gate a few yards
    </p>
    <p>
     there were the embers of a fire, and round it a bivouac of footmen who
    </p>
    <p>
     had been to the feast, and had returned thus far before nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing the noise, some of them arose, and came round him, when one
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately exclaimed and asked if he was wounded. Felix replied that he
    </p>
    <p>
     was not, but looking at his foot where the man pointed, saw that it was
    </p>
    <p>
     covered with blood. But, upon close examination, there was no cut or
    </p>
    <p>
     incision; he was not hurt. The warder now called to them, and showed a
    </p>
    <p>
     long deep scratch on the near flank of the horse, from which the blood
    </p>
    <p>
     was dripping.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was such a scratch as might have been made with an iron nail, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     without hesitation, they all put it down to a Bushman's spud. Without
    </p>
    <p>
     doubt, the Bushman, hearing Felix approach, had hidden in the maple
    </p>
    <p>
     bush, and, as he passed, struck with his nail-like dagger; but,
    </p>
    <p>
     miscalculating the speed at which the horse was going, instead of
    </p>
    <p>
     piercing the thigh of the rider, the blow fell on the horse, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     sharp point was dragged along the side. The horse trembled as they
    </p>
    <p>
     touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir," said one of the retainers, their headman, "if you will pardon me,
    </p>
    <p>
     you had best string your bow and send a shaft through his heart, for he
    </p>
    <p>
     will die in misery before morning."
    </p>
    <p>
     The Bushman's spud, the one he uses for assassination or to despatch his
    </p>
    <p>
     prey, is poisoned. It is a lingering poison, and takes several hours to
    </p>
    <p>
     produce its effect; but no remedy is known, and many who have escaped
    </p>
    <p>
     from the cowardly blow have crawled to the path only to expire in
    </p>
    <p>
     torture. There was no denying that what the retainer proposed was the
    </p>
    <p>
     only thing that could be done. The warder had meantime brought a bucket
    </p>
    <p>
     of water, of which the poor creature drank eagerly. Felix could not do
    </p>
    <p>
     it; he could not slay the creature which had carried him so long, and
    </p>
    <p>
     which twice that night had saved him, and was now to die, as it were, in
    </p>
    <p>
     his place. He could not consent to it; he led the horse towards home,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he was weak or weary, and could not be got beyond the Pen.
    </p>
    <p>
     There the group assembled around him. Felix ordered the scratch to be
    </p>
    <p>
     cleansed, while he ran over in his mind every possible remedy. He gave
    </p>
    <p>
     strict orders that he should not be despatched, and then hastened to the
    </p>
    <p>
     house. He undid with trembling hands the thongs that bound his chest,
    </p>
    <p>
     and took out his manuscripts, hoping against hope that among the many
    </p>
    <p>
     notes he had made there might be something. But there was nothing, or in
    </p>
    <p>
     his excitement he overlooked it. Remembering that Oliver was a great
    </p>
    <p>
     authority upon horses, he went into his room and tried to wake him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver, weary with his ride, and not as yet having slept off the effects
    </p>
    <p>
     of the feast, could not be roused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix left him and hurried back to the Pen. Weary as he was, he watched
    </p>
    <p>
     by the horse till the larks began to sing and the dawn was at hand. As
    </p>
    <p>
     yet he had not shown any severe symptoms except twitching of the limbs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a constant thirst, which water could not quench. But suddenly he
    </p>
    <p>
     fell, and the old retainer warned them all to stand away, for he would
    </p>
    <p>
     bite anything that was near. His words were instantly fulfilled; he
    </p>
    <p>
     rolled, and kicked, and bit at everything within reach. Seeing this
    </p>
    <p>
     agony, Felix could no longer delay. He strung his bow, but he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     fit the arrow to the string, he missed the notch, so much did his hands
    </p>
    <p>
     shake. He motioned to the retainers who had gathered around, and one of
    </p>
    <p>
     them thrust his spear into the horse behind his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Felix at last returned to his chamber he could not but reflect, as
    </p>
    <p>
     the sun rose and the beams entered, that every omen had been against
    </p>
    <p>
     him; the adder under foot, the bandit's bolt, the Bushman's poisoned
    </p>
    <p>
     point. He slept till noon, and, upon going out, unrefreshed and still
    </p>
    <p>
     weary, he found that they had already buried the horse, and ordered a
    </p>
    <p>
     mound to be raised above his grave. The day passed slowly; he wandered
    </p>
    <p>
     about the castle and the enclosed grounds, seeking comfort and finding
    </p>
    <p>
     none. His mind vacillated; he recalled all that Aurora had said,
    </p>
    <p>
     persuading him not to do anything in haste or despair. Yet he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     continue in his present condition. Another day went by, and still
    </p>
    <p>
     undecided and doubting, he remained at home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver began to jest at him; had he abandoned the expedition? Oliver
    </p>
    <p>
     could not understand indecision; perhaps he did not see so many sides to
    </p>
    <p>
     the question, his mind was always quickly made up. Action was his forte,
    </p>
    <p>
     not thought. The night came, and still Felix lingered, hesitating.

    <p>
     SAILING AWAY
    </p>
    <p>
     But the next morning Felix arose straight from his sleep resolved to
    </p>
    <p>
     carry out his plan. Without staying to think a moment, without further
    </p>
    <p>
     examination of the various sides of the problem, he started up the
    </p>
    <p>
     instant his eyes unclosed, fully determined upon his voyage. The breath
    </p>
    <p>
     of the bright June morn as he threw open the window-shutter filled him
    </p>
    <p>
     with hope; his heart responded to its joyous influence. The excitement
    </p>
    <p>
     which had disturbed his mind had had time to subside. In the still
    </p>
    <p>
     slumber of the night the strong undercurrent of his thought resumed its
    </p>
    <p>
     course, and he awoke with his will still firmly bent in one direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he had dressed, he took his bow and the chest bound with the
    </p>
    <p>
     leathern thongs, and went down. It was early, but the Baron had already
    </p>
    <p>
     finished breakfast and gone out to his gardens; the Baroness had not yet
    </p>
    <p>
     appeared. While he was making a hurried breakfast (for having now made
    </p>
    <p>
     up his mind he was eager to put his resolve into execution), Oliver came
    </p>
    <p>
     in, and seeing the chest and the bow, understood that the hour had
    </p>
    <p>
     arrived. He immediately said he should accompany him to Heron Bay, and
    </p>
    <p>
     assist him to start, and went out to order their horses. There were
    </p>
    <p>
     always plenty of riding horses at Old House (as at every fortified
    </p>
    <p>
     mansion), and there was not the least difficulty in getting another for
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix in place of his old favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oliver insisted upon taking the wooden chest, which was rather heavy,
    </p>
    <p>
     before him on the saddle, so that Felix had nothing to carry but his
    </p>
    <p>
     favourite bow. Oliver was surprised that Felix did not first go to the
    </p>
    <p>
     gardens and say good-bye to the Baron, or at least knock at the
    </p>
    <p>
     Baroness's door and bid her farewell. But he made no remark, knowing
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix's proud and occasionally hard temper. Without a word Felix left
    </p>
    <p>
     the old place.
    </p>
    <p>
     He rode forth from the North Barrier, and did not even so much as look
    </p>
    <p>
     behind him. Neither he nor Oliver thought of the events that might
    </p>
    <p>
     happen before they should again meet in the old familiar house! When the
    </p>
    <p>
     circle is once broken up it is often years before it is reformed. Often,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, the members of it never meet again, at least, not in the same
    </p>
    <p>
     manner, which, perhaps, they detested then, and ever afterwards
    </p>
    <p>
     regretted. Without one word of farewell, without a glance, Felix rode
    </p>
    <p>
     out into the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was not much conversation on the trail to Heron Bay. The serfs
    </p>
    <p>
     were still there in charge of the canoe, and were glad enough to see
    </p>
    <p>
     their approach, and thus to be relieved from their lonely watch. They
    </p>
    <p>
     launched the canoe with ease, the provisions were put on board, the
    </p>
    <p>
     chest lashed to the mast that it might not be lost, the favourite bow
    </p>
    <p>
     was also fastened upright to the mast for safety, and simply shaking
    </p>
    <p>
     hands with Oliver, Felix pushed out into the creek. He paddled the canoe
    </p>
    <p>
     to the entrance and out into the Lake till he arrived where the
    </p>
    <p>
     south-west breeze, coming over the forest, touched and rippled the
    </p>
    <p>
     water, which by the shore was perfectly calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, hoisting the sail, he put out the larger paddle which answered as
    </p>
    <p>
     a rudder, took his seat, and, waving his hand to Oliver, began his
    </p>
    <p>
     voyage. The wind was but light, and almost too favourable, for he had
    </p>
    <p>
     determined to sail to the eastward; not for any specific reason, but
    </p>
    <p>
     because there the sun rose, and that was the quarter of light and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     His canoe, with a long fore-and-aft sail, and so well adapted for
    </p>
    <p>
     working into the wind, was not well rigged for drifting before a breeze,
    </p>
    <p>
     which was what he was now doing. He had merely to keep the canoe before
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind, steering so as to clear the bold headland of White Horse which
    </p>
    <p>
     rose blue from the water's edge far in front of him. Though the wind was
    </p>
    <p>
     light, the canoe being so taper and sharp at the prow, and the sail so
    </p>
    <p>
     large in comparison, slipped from the shore faster than he at first
    </p>
    <p>
     imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he steered aslant from the little bay outwards into the great Lake,
    </p>
    <p>
     the ripples rolling before the wind gradually enlarged into wavelets,
    </p>
    <p>
     these again increased, and in half an hour, as the wind now played upon
    </p>
    <p>
     them over a mile of surface, they seemed in his canoe, with its low
    </p>
    <p>
     freeboard, to be considerable waves. He had purposely refrained from
    </p>
    <p>
     looking back till now, lest they should think he regretted leaving, and
    </p>
    <p>
     in his heart desired to return. But now, feeling that he had really
    </p>
    <p>
     started, he glanced behind. He could see no one.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had forgotten that the spot where they had launched the canoe was at
    </p>
    <p>
     the end of an inlet, and as he sailed away the creek was shut off from
    </p>
    <p>
     view by the shore of the Lake. Unable to get to the mouth of the bay
    </p>
    <p>
     because of the underwood and the swampy soil, Oliver had remained gazing
    </p>
    <p>
     in the direction the canoe had taken for a minute or two, absorbed in
    </p>
    <p>
     thought (almost the longest period he had ever wasted in such an
    </p>
    <p>
     occupation), and then with a whistle turned to go. The serfs,
    </p>
    <p>
     understanding that they were no longer required, gathered their things
    </p>
    <p>
     together, and were shortly on their way home. Oliver, holding Felix's
    </p>
    <p>
     horse by the bridle, had already ridden that way, but he presently
    </p>
    <p>
     halted, and waited till the three men overtook him. He then gave the
    </p>
    <p>
     horse into their charge, and turning to the right, along a forest path
    </p>
    <p>
     which branched off there, went to Ponze. Felix could therefore see no
    </p>
    <p>
     one when he looked back, and they were indeed already on their way from
    </p>
    <p>
     the place.
    </p>
    <p>
     He now felt that he was alone. He had parted from the shore, and from
    </p>
    <p>
     all the old associations; he was fast passing not only out upon the
    </p>
    <p>
     water, but out into the unknown future. But his spirit no longer
    </p>
    <p>
     vacillated; now that he was really in the beginning of his long
    </p>
    <p>
     contemplated enterprise his natural strength of mind returned. The
    </p>
    <p>
     weakness and irresolution, the hesitation, left him. He became full of
    </p>
    <p>
     his adventure, and thought of nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
     The south-west breeze, blowing as a man breathes, with alternate rise
    </p>
    <p>
     and fall, now driving him along rapidly till the water bubbled under the
    </p>
    <p>
     prow, now sinking, came over his right shoulder and cooled his cheek,
    </p>
    <p>
     for it was now noon, and the June sun was unchecked by clouds. He could
    </p>
    <p>
     no longer distinguish the shape of the trees on shore; all the boughs
    </p>
    <p>
     were blended together in one great wood, stretching as far as he could
    </p>
    <p>
     see. On his left there was a chain of islands, some covered with firs,
    </p>
    <p>
     and others only with brushwood, while others again were so low and flat
    </p>
    <p>
     that the waves in stormy weather broke almost over them.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he drew near White Horse, five white terns, or sea-swallows, flew
    </p>
    <p>
     over; he did not welcome their appearance, as they usually preceded
    </p>
    <p>
     rough gales. The headland, wooded to its ridge, now rose high against
    </p>
    <p>
     the sky; ash and nut-tree and hawthorn had concealed the ancient graven
    </p>
    <p>
     figure of the horse upon its side, but the tradition was not forgotten,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the site retained its name. He had been steering so as just to clear
    </p>
    <p>
     the promontory, but he now remembered that when he had visited the
    </p>
    <p>
     summit of the hill, he had observed that banks and shoals extended far
    </p>
    <p>
     out from the shore, and were nearly on a level with the surface of the
    </p>
    <p>
     Lake. In a calm they were visible, but waves concealed them, and unless
    </p>
    <p>
     the helmsman recognised the swirl sufficiently early to change his
    </p>
    <p>
     course, they were extremely dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix bore more out from the land, and passing fully a mile to the
    </p>
    <p>
     north, left the shoals on his right. On his other hand there was a sandy
    </p>
    <p>
     and barren island barely a quarter of a mile distant, upon which he
    </p>
    <p>
     thought he saw the timbers of a wreck. It was quite probable, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     island lay in the track of vessels coasting along the shore. Beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     White Horse, the land fell away in a series of indentations, curving
    </p>
    <p>
     inwards to the south; an inhospitable coast, for the hills came down to
    </p>
    <p>
     the strand, ending abruptly in low, but steep, chalk cliffs. Many
    </p>
    <p>
     islands of large size stood out on the left, but Felix, not knowing the
    </p>
    <p>
     shape of the Lake beyond White Horse, thought it best to follow the
    </p>
    <p>
     trend of the land. He thus found, after about three hours, that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     gone far out of his course, for the gulf-like curve of the coast now
    </p>
    <p>
     began to return to the northward, and looking in that direction he saw a
    </p>
    <p>
     merchant vessel under her one square sail of great size, standing across
    </p>
    <p>
     the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was about five miles distant, and was evidently steering so as to
    </p>
    <p>
     keep just inside the line of the islands. Felix, with some difficulty,
    </p>
    <p>
     steered in a direction to interrupt her. The south-west wind being then
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately aft, his sail did not answer well; presently he lowered it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and paddled till he had turned the course so that the outrigger was now
    </p>
    <p>
     on the eastern side. Then hoisting the sail again, he sat at what had
    </p>
    <p>
     before been the prow, and steered a point or so nearer the wind. This
    </p>
    <p>
     improved her sailing, but as the merchant ship had at least five miles
    </p>
    <p>
     start, it would take some hours to overtake her. Nor on reflection was
    </p>
    <p>
     he at all anxious to come up with her, for mariners were dreaded for
    </p>
    <p>
     their lawless conduct, being, when on a voyage, beyond all jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the one hand, if they saw an opportunity, they did not hesitate to
    </p>
    <p>
     land and pillage a house, or even a hamlet. On the other, those who
    </p>
    <p>
     dwelt anywhere near the shore considered it good sport to light a fire
    </p>
    <p>
     and lure a vessel to her destruction, or if she was becalmed to sally
    </p>
    <p>
     out in boats, attack, and perhaps destroy both ship and crew. Hence the
    </p>
    <p>
     many wrecks, and losses, and the risks of navigation, not so much from
    </p>
    <p>
     natural obstacles, since the innumerable islands, and the creeks and
    </p>
    <p>
     inlets of the mainland almost always offered shelter, no matter which
    </p>
    <p>
     way the storm blew, but from the animosity of the coast people. If there
    </p>
    <p>
     was an important harbour and a town where provisions could be obtained,
    </p>
    <p>
     or repairs effected, the right of entrance was jealously guarded, and no
    </p>
    <p>
     ship, however pressed by the gale, was permitted to leave, if she had
    </p>
    <p>
     anchored, without payment of a fine. So that vessels as much as possible
    </p>
    <p>
     avoided the harbours and towns, and the mainland altogether, sailing
    </p>
    <p>
     along beside the islands, which were, for the most part, uninhabited,
    </p>
    <p>
     and anchoring under their lee at night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix, remembering the character of the mariners, resolved to keep well
    </p>
    <p>
     away from them, but to watch their course as a guide to himself. The
    </p>
    <p>
     mainland now ran abruptly to the north, and the canoe, as he brought her
    </p>
    <p>
     more into the wind, sprang forward at a rapid pace. The outrigger
    </p>
    <p>
     prevented her from making any leeway, or heeling over, and the large
    </p>
    <p>
     spread of sail forced her swiftly through the water. He had lost sight
    </p>
    <p>
     of the ship behind some islands, and as he approached these, began to
    </p>
    <p>
     ask himself if he had not better haul down his sail there, as he must
    </p>
    <p>
     now be getting near her, when to his surprise, on coming close, he saw
    </p>
    <p>
     her great square sail in the middle, as it seemed, of the land. The
    </p>
    <p>
     shore there was flat, the hills which had hitherto bounded it suddenly
    </p>
    <p>
     ceasing; it was overgrown with reeds and flags, and about two miles away
    </p>
    <p>
     the dark sail of the merchantman drifted over these, the hull being
    </p>
    <p>
     hidden. He at once knew that he had reached the western mouth of the
    </p>
    <p>
     straits which divide the southern and northern mainland. When he went to
    </p>
    <p>
     see the channel on foot through the forest, he must have struck it a
    </p>
    <p>
     mile or two more to the east, where it wound under the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
     In another half hour he arrived at the opening of the strait; it was
    </p>
    <p>
     about a mile wide, and either shore was quite flat, that on the right
    </p>
    <p>
     for a short distance, the range of downs approaching within two miles;
    </p>
    <p>
     that on the left, or north, was level as far as he could see. He had now
    </p>
    <p>
     again to lower his sail, to get the outrigger on his lee as he turned to
    </p>
    <p>
     the right and steered due east into the channel. So long as the shore
    </p>
    <p>
     was level, he had no difficulty, for the wind drew over it, but when the
    </p>
    <p>
     hills gradually came near and almost overhung the channel, they shut off
    </p>
    <p>
     much of the breeze, and his progress was slow. When it turned and ran
    </p>
    <p>
     narrowing every moment to the south, the wind failed him altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the right shore, wooded hills rose from the water like a wall; on the
    </p>
    <p>
     left, it was a perfect plain. He could see nothing of the merchantman,
    </p>
    <p>
     although he knew that she could not sail here, but must be working
    </p>
    <p>
     through with her sweeps. Her heavy hull and bluff bow must make the
    </p>
    <p>
     rowing a slow and laborious process; therefore she could not be far
    </p>
    <p>
     ahead, but was concealed by the winding of the strait. He lowered the
    </p>
    <p>
     sail, as it was now useless, and began to paddle; in a very short time
    </p>
    <p>
     he found the heat under the hills oppressive when thus working. He had
    </p>
    <p>
     now been afloat between six and seven hours, and must have come fully
    </p>
    <p>
     thirty miles, perhaps rather more than twenty in a straight line, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     felt somewhat weary and cramped from sitting so long in the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though he paddled hard he did not seem to make much progress, and at
    </p>
    <p>
     length he recognised that there was a distinct current, which opposed
    </p>
    <p>
     his advance, flowing through the channel from east to west. If he ceased
    </p>
    <p>
     paddling, he found he drifted slowly back; the long aquatic weeds, too,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he passed, all extended their floating streamers westward. We did
    </p>
    <p>
     not know of this current till Felix Aquila observed and recorded it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tired and hungry (for, full of his voyage, he had taken no refreshments
    </p>
    <p>
     since he started), he resolved to land, rest a little while, and then
    </p>
    <p>
     ascend the hill, and see what he could of the channel. He soon reached
    </p>
    <p>
     the shore, the strait having narrowed to less than a mile in width, and
    </p>
    <p>
     ran the canoe on the ground by a bush, to which, on getting out, he
    </p>
    <p>
     attached the painter. The relief of stretching his limbs was so great
    </p>
    <p>
     that it seemed to endow him with fresh strength, and without waiting to
    </p>
    <p>
     eat, he at once climbed the hill. From the top, the remainder of the
    </p>
    <p>
     strait could be easily distinguished. But a short distance from where he
    </p>
    <p>
     stood, it bent again, and proceeded due east.

    <p>
     THE STRAITS
    </p>
    <p>
     The passage contracted there to little over half a mile, but these
    </p>
    <p>
     narrows did not continue far; the shores, having approached thus near
    </p>
    <p>
     each other, quickly receded, till presently they were at least two miles
    </p>
    <p>
     apart. The merchant vessel had passed the narrows with the aid of her
    </p>
    <p>
     sweeps, but she moved slowly, and, as it seemed to him, with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was about a mile and a half distant, and near the eastern mouth of
    </p>
    <p>
     the strait. As Felix watched he saw her square sail again raised,
    </p>
    <p>
     showing that she had reached a spot where the hills ceased to shut off
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind. Entering the open Lake she altered her course and sailed away
    </p>
    <p>
     to the north-north-east, following the course of the northern mainland.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking now eastwards, across the Lake, he saw a vast and beautiful
    </p>
    <p>
     expanse of water, without island or break of any kind, reaching to the
    </p>
    <p>
     horizon. Northwards and southwards the land fell rapidly away, skirted
    </p>
    <p>
     as usual with islets and shoals, between which and the shore vessels
    </p>
    <p>
     usually voyaged. He had heard of this open water, and it was his
    </p>
    <p>
     intention to sail out into and explore it, but as the sun now began to
    </p>
    <p>
     decline towards the west, he considered that he had better wait till
    </p>
    <p>
     morning, and so have a whole day before him. Meantime, he would paddle
    </p>
    <p>
     through the channel, beach the canoe on the islet that stood farthest
    </p>
    <p>
     out, and so start clear on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning now to look back the other way, westward, he was surprised to
    </p>
    <p>
     see a second channel, which came almost to the foot of the hill on which
    </p>
    <p>
     he stood, but there ended and did not connect with the first. The
    </p>
    <p>
     entrance to it was concealed, as he now saw, by an island, past which he
    </p>
    <p>
     must have sailed that afternoon. This second or blind channel seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     more familiar to him than the flat and reedy shore at the mouth of the
    </p>
    <p>
     true strait, and he now recognised it as the one to which he had
    </p>
    <p>
     journeyed on foot through the forest. He had not then struck the true
    </p>
    <p>
     strait at all; he had sat down and pondered beside this deceptive inlet
    </p>
    <p>
     thinking that it divided the mainlands. From this discovery he saw how
    </p>
    <p>
     easy it was to be misled in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it even more fully convinced him of the importance of this
    </p>
    <p>
     uninhabited and neglected place. It seemed like a canal cut on purpose
    </p>
    <p>
     to supply a fort from the Lake in the rear with provisions and material,
    </p>
    <p>
     supposing access in front prevented by hostile fleets and armies. A
    </p>
    <p>
     castle, if built near where he stood, would command the channel; arrows,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, could not be shot across, but vessels under the protection of
    </p>
    <p>
     the castle could dispute the passage, obstructed as it could be with
    </p>
    <p>
     floating booms. An invader coming from the north must cross here; for
    </p>
    <p>
     many years past there had been a general feeling that some day such an
    </p>
    <p>
     attempt would be made. Fortifications would be of incalculable value in
    </p>
    <p>
     repelling the hostile hordes and preventing their landing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who held this strait would possess the key of the Lake, and would be
    </p>
    <p>
     master of, or would at least hold the balance between, the kings and
    </p>
    <p>
     republics dotted along the coasts on either hand. No vessel could pass
    </p>
    <p>
     without his permission. It was the most patent illustration of the
    </p>
    <p>
     extremely local horizon, the contracted mental view of the petty kings
    </p>
    <p>
     and their statesmen, who were so concerned about the frontiers of their
    </p>
    <p>
     provinces, and frequently interfered and fought for a single palisaded
    </p>
    <p>
     estate or barony, yet were quite oblivious of the opportunity of empire
    </p>
    <p>
     open here to any who could seize it.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the governor of such a castle as he imagined built upon the strait,
    </p>
    <p>
     had also vessels of war, they could lie in this second channel sheltered
    </p>
    <p>
     from all winds, and ready to sally forth and take an attacking force
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the flank. While he pondered upon these advantages he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     conceal from himself that he had once sat down and dreamed beside this
    </p>
    <p>
     second inlet, thinking it to be the channel. The doubt arose whether, if
    </p>
    <p>
     he was so easily misled in such a large, tangible, and purely physical
    </p>
    <p>
     matter, he might not be deceived also in his ideas; whether, if tested,
    </p>
    <p>
     they might not fail; whether the world was not right and he wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     The very clearness and many-sided character of his mind often hindered
    </p>
    <p>
     and even checked altogether the best founded of his impressions, the
    </p>
    <p>
     more especially when he, as it were, stood still and thought. In
    </p>
    <p>
     reverie, the subtlety of his mind entangled him; in action, he was
    </p>
    <p>
     almost always right. Action prompted his decision. Descending from the
    </p>
    <p>
     hill he now took some refreshment, and then pushed out again in the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe. So powerful was the current in the narrowest part of the strait
    </p>
    <p>
     that it occupied him two hours in paddling as many miles.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he was free of the channel, he hoisted sail and directed his course
    </p>
    <p>
     straight out for an island which stood almost opposite the entrance. But
    </p>
    <p>
     as he approached, driven along at a good pace, suddenly the canoe seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     to be seized from beneath. He knew in a moment that he had grounded on
    </p>
    <p>
     soft mud, and sprang up to lower the sail, but before he could do so the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe came to a standstill on the mud-bank, and the waves following
    </p>
    <p>
     behind, directly she stopped, broke over the stern. Fortunately they
    </p>
    <p>
     were but small, having only a mile or so to roll from the shore, but
    </p>
    <p>
     they flung enough water on board in a few minutes to spoil part of his
    </p>
    <p>
     provisions, and to set everything afloat that was loose on the bottom of
    </p>
    <p>
     the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was apprehensive lest she should fill, for he now perceived that he
    </p>
    <p>
     had forgotten to provide anything with which to bale her out. Something
    </p>
    <p>
     is always forgotten. Having got the sail down (lest the wind should snap
    </p>
    <p>
     the mast), he tried hard to force the canoe back with his longer paddle,
    </p>
    <p>
     used as a movable rudder. His weight and the resistance of the adhesive
    </p>
    <p>
     mud, on which she had driven with much force was too great; he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     shove her off. When he pushed, the paddle sank into the soft bottom, and
    </p>
    <p>
     gave him nothing to press against. After struggling for some time, he
    </p>
    <p>
     paused, beginning to fear that his voyage had already reached an end.
    </p>
    <p>
     A minute's thought, more potent than the strength of ten men, showed him
    </p>
    <p>
     that the canoe required lightening. There was no cargo to throw
    </p>
    <p>
     overboard, nor ballast. He was the only weight. He immediately
    </p>
    <p>
     undressed, and let himself overboard at the prow, retaining hold of the
    </p>
    <p>
     stem. His feet sank deep into the ooze; he felt as if, had he let go, he
    </p>
    <p>
     should have gradually gone down into this quicksand of fine mud. By
    </p>
    <p>
     rapidly moving his feet he managed, however, to push the canoe; she rose
    </p>
    <p>
     considerably so soon as he was out of her, and, although he had hold of
    </p>
    <p>
     the prow, still his body was lighter in the water. Pushing, struggling,
    </p>
    <p>
     and pressing forward, he, by sheer impact, as it were, for his feet
    </p>
    <p>
     found no hold in the mud, forced her back by slow degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
     The blows of the waves drove her forward almost as much as he pushed her
    </p>
    <p>
     back. Still, in time, and when his strength was fast decreasing, she did
    </p>
    <p>
     move, and he had the satisfaction of feeling the water deeper beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     him. But when he endeavoured to pull himself into the canoe over the
    </p>
    <p>
     prow, directly his motive power ceased, the waves undid the advance he
    </p>
    <p>
     had achieved, and he had to resume his labour. This time, thinking
    </p>
    <p>
     again, before he attempted to get into the canoe he turned her sideways
    </p>
    <p>
     to the wind, with the outrigger to leeward. When her sharp prow and
    </p>
    <p>
     rounded keel struck the mud-bank end on she ran easily along it. But,
    </p>
    <p>
     turned sideways, her length found more resistance, and though the waves
    </p>
    <p>
     sent her some way upon it, she soon came to a standstill. He clambered
    </p>
    <p>
     in as quickly as he could (it is not easy to get into a boat out of the
    </p>
    <p>
     water, the body feels so heavy), and, taking the paddle, without waiting
    </p>
    <p>
     to dress, worked away from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not till he had got some quarter of a mile back towards the mainland did
    </p>
    <p>
     he pause to dry himself and resume part of his clothing; the canoe being
    </p>
    <p>
     still partly full of water, it was no use to put on all. Resting awhile
    </p>
    <p>
     after his severe exertions, he looked back, and now supposed, from the
    </p>
    <p>
     colour of the water and the general indications, that these shallows
    </p>
    <p>
     extended a long distance, surrounding the islands at the mouth of the
    </p>
    <p>
     channel, so that no vessel could enter or pass out in a direct line, but
    </p>
    <p>
     must steer to the north or south until the obstacle was rounded. Afraid
    </p>
    <p>
     to attempt to land on another island, his only course, as the sun was
    </p>
    <p>
     now going down, was to return to the mainland, which he reached without
    </p>
    <p>
     much trouble, as the current favoured him.
    </p>
    <p>
     He drew the canoe upon the ground as far as he could. It was not a good
    </p>
    <p>
     place to land, as the bottom was chalk, washed into holes by the waves,
    </p>
    <p>
     and studded with angular flints. As the wind was off the shore it did
    </p>
    <p>
     not matter; if it had blown from the east, his canoe might very likely
    </p>
    <p>
     have been much damaged. The shore was overgrown with hazel to within
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty yards of the water, then the ground rose and was clothed with low
    </p>
    <p>
     ash-trees, whose boughs seemed much stunted by tempest, showing how
    </p>
    <p>
     exposed the spot was to the easterly gales of spring. The south-west
    </p>
    <p>
     wind was shut off by the hills beyond. Felix was so weary that for some
    </p>
    <p>
     time he did nothing save rest upon the ground, which was but scantily
    </p>
    <p>
     covered with grass. An hour's rest, however, restored him to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     He gathered some dry sticks (there were plenty under the ashes), struck
    </p>
    <p>
     his flint against the steel, ignited the tinder, and soon had a fire. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was not necessary for warmth, the June evening was soft and warm, but it
    </p>
    <p>
     was the hunter's instinct. Upon camping for the night the hunter, unless
    </p>
    <p>
     Bushmen are suspected to be in the neighbourhood, invariably lights a
    </p>
    <p>
     fire, first to cook his supper, and secondly, and often principally, to
    </p>
    <p>
     make the spot his home. The hearth is home, whether there be walls round
    </p>
    <p>
     it or not. Directly there are glowing embers the place is no longer
    </p>
    <p>
     wild, it becomes human. Felix had nothing that needed cooking. He took
    </p>
    <p>
     his cowhide from the canoe and spread it on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     A well-seasoned cowhide is the first possession of every hunter; it
    </p>
    <p>
     keeps him from the damp; and with a second, supported on three short
    </p>
    <p>
     poles stuck in the earth (two crossed at the top in front, forming a
    </p>
    <p>
     fork, and fastened with a thong, the third resting on these), he
    </p>
    <p>
     protects himself from the heaviest rain. This little tent is always
    </p>
    <p>
     built with the back to windward. Felix did not erect a second hide, the
    </p>
    <p>
     evening was so warm and beautiful he did not need it, his cloak would be
    </p>
    <p>
     ample for covering. The fire crackled and blazed at intervals, just far
    </p>
    <p>
     enough from him that he might feel no inconvenience from its heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thrushes sang in the ash wood all around him, the cuckoo called, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     chiff-chaff never ceased for a moment. Before him stretched the expanse
    </p>
    <p>
     of waters; he could even here see over the low islands. In the sky a
    </p>
    <p>
     streak of cloud was tinted by the sunset, slowly becoming paler as the
    </p>
    <p>
     light departed. He reclined in that idle, thoughtless state which
    </p>
    <p>
     succeeds unusual effort, till the deepening shadow and the sinking fire,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the appearance of a star, warned him that the night was really here.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then he arose, threw on more fuel, and fetched his cloak, his chest, and
    </p>
    <p>
     his boar spear from the canoe. The chest he covered with a corner of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hide, wrapped himself in the cloak, bringing it well over his face on
    </p>
    <p>
     account of the dew; then, drawing the lower corners of the hide over his
    </p>
    <p>
     feet and limbs, he stretched himself at full length and fell asleep,
    </p>
    <p>
     with the spear beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was the possibility of Bushmen, but not much probability. There
    </p>
    <p>
     would be far more danger near the forest path, where they might expect a
    </p>
    <p>
     traveller and watch to waylay him, but they could not tell beforehand
    </p>
    <p>
     where he would rest that night. If any had seen the movements of his
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe, if any lighted upon his bivouac by chance, his fate was certain.
    </p>
    <p>
     He knew this, but trusted to the extreme improbability of Bushmen
    </p>
    <p>
     frequenting a place where there was nothing to plunder. Besides, he had
    </p>
    <p>
     no choice, as he could not reach the islands. If there was risk, it was
    </p>
    <p>
     forgotten in the extremity of his weariness.

     CHAPTER XV
    </head>
    <p>
     SAILING ONWARDS
    </p>
    <p>
     When Felix awoke, he knew at once by the height of the sun that the
    </p>
    <p>
     morning was far advanced. Throwing off his cloak, he stood up, but
    </p>
    <p>
     immediately crouched down again, for a vessel was passing but a short
    </p>
    <p>
     distance from the shore, and nearly opposite his encampment. She had two
    </p>
    <p>
     masts, and from the flags flying, the numerous bannerets, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     movements of so many men on board, he knew her to be a ship of war. He
    </p>
    <p>
     was anxious that he should not be seen, and regretted that his canoe was
    </p>
    <p>
     so much exposed, for the bush by which he had landed hid it only from
    </p>
    <p>
     one side. As the shore was so bare and open, if they looked that way the
    </p>
    <p>
     men on board would hardly fail to see it, and might even distinguish
    </p>
    <p>
     him. But whether they were too much engaged with their own affairs, or
    </p>
    <p>
     kept a careless look-out, no notice appeared to be taken, no boat was
    </p>
    <p>
     lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
     He watched the war-ship for nearly an hour before he ventured to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her course was to the eastward, inside the fringe of islands. That she
    </p>
    <p>
     was neither Irish nor Welsh he was certain from her build and from her
    </p>
    <p>
     flags; they were too distant for the exact designs upon them to be seen,
    </p>
    <p>
     but near enough for him to know that they were not those displayed by
    </p>
    <p>
     the foreigners. She sailed fast, having the wind nearly aft, which
    </p>
    <p>
     suited her two square sails.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wind had risen high during the night, and now blew almost a gale, so
    </p>
    <p>
     that he saw he must abandon for the present his project of sailing out
    </p>
    <p>
     upon the open water. The waves there would be too high for his canoe,
    </p>
    <p>
     which floated low in the water, and had but about six inches freeboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     They would wash over and possibly swamp her. Only two courses were open
    </p>
    <p>
     to him: either to sail inside the islands under shelter of the land, or
    </p>
    <p>
     to remain where he was till the breeze moderated. If he sailed inside
    </p>
    <p>
     the islands, following the northward course of the merchant vessel he
    </p>
    <p>
     had observed the previous evening, that would carry him past Eaststock,
    </p>
    <p>
     the eastern port of Sypolis, which city, itself inland, had two
    </p>
    <p>
     harbours, with the western of which (Weststock) it had communication by
    </p>
    <p>
     water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Should he continue to sail on, he would soon reach that part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     northern continent which was occupied by the Irish outposts. On the
    </p>
    <p>
     other hand, to follow the war-ship, east by south, would, he knew, bring
    </p>
    <p>
     him by the great city of Aisi, famous for its commerce, its riches, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the warlike disposition of its king, Isembard. He was the acknowledged
    </p>
    <p>
     head of the forces of the League; but yet, with the inconsistency of the
    </p>
    <p>
     age, sometimes attacked other members of it. His furious energy was
    </p>
    <p>
     always disturbing the world, and Felix had no doubt he was now at war
    </p>
    <p>
     with some one or other, and that the war-ship he had seen was on its way
    </p>
    <p>
     to assist him or his enemies. One of the possibilities which had
    </p>
    <p>
     impelled him to this voyage was that of taking service with some king or
    </p>
    <p>
     commander, and so perhaps gradually rising himself to command.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such adventures were very common, knights often setting forth upon such
    </p>
    <p>
     expeditions when dissatisfied with their own rulers, and they were
    </p>
    <p>
     usually much welcomed as an addition to the strength of the camp they
    </p>
    <p>
     sought. But there was this difference: that such knights carried with
    </p>
    <p>
     them some substantial recommendation, either numerous retainers well
    </p>
    <p>
     armed and accustomed to battle, considerable treasure, or at least a
    </p>
    <p>
     reputation for prowess in the field. Felix had nothing to offer, and for
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing nothing is given.
    </p>
    <p>
     The world does not recognise intrinsic worth, or potential genius.
    </p>
    <p>
     Genius must accomplish some solid result before it is applauded and
    </p>
    <p>
     received. The unknown architect may say: "I have a design in my mind for
    </p>
    <p>
     an impregnable castle." But the world cannot see or appreciate the mere
    </p>
    <p>
     design. If by any personal sacrifice of time, dignity, or self-respect
    </p>
    <p>
     the architect, after long years, can persuade someone to permit him to
    </p>
    <p>
     build the castle, to put his design into solid stone which squadrons may
    </p>
    <p>
     knock their heads against in vain, then he is acknowledged. There is
    </p>
    <p>
     then a tangible result.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix was in the position of the architect. He believed he had ideas,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he had nothing substantial, no result, to point to. He had therefore
    </p>
    <p>
     but little hope of success, and his natural hauteur and pride revolted
    </p>
    <p>
     against making application for enrolment which must be accompanied with
    </p>
    <p>
     much personal humiliation, since at best he could but begin in the
    </p>
    <p>
     common ranks. The very idea of asking was repugnant to him. The thought
    </p>
    <p>
     of Aurora, however, drew him on.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pride was false, he said to himself, and arose from too high an
    </p>
    <p>
     estimate of his abilities; or it was the consequence of living so long
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely secluded from the world. He acknowledged to himself that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     not been beaten down to his level. Full of devotion to Aurora, he
    </p>
    <p>
     resolved to humble himself, to seek the humblest service in King
    </p>
    <p>
     Isembard's camp, to bow his spirit to the orders of men above him in
    </p>
    <p>
     rank but below him in birth and ability, to submit to the numberless
    </p>
    <p>
     indignities of a common soldier's life.
    </p>
    <p>
     He proceeded to launch the canoe, and had already placed the chest on
    </p>
    <p>
     board when it occurred to him that the difficulties he had encountered
    </p>
    <p>
     the previous evening, when his canoe was so nearly lost, arose from his
    </p>
    <p>
     ignorance of the channels. It would be advisable to ascend the hill, and
    </p>
    <p>
     carefully survey the coast as far as possible before setting forth. He
    </p>
    <p>
     did so. The war-ship was still visible from the summit, but while he
    </p>
    <p>
     looked she was hidden by the intervening islands. The white foam and
    </p>
    <p>
     angry appearance of the distant open water direct to the eastward,
    </p>
    <p>
     showed how wise he had been not to attempt its exploration. Under the
    </p>
    <p>
     land the wind was steady; yonder, where the gale struck the surface with
    </p>
    <p>
     all its force, the waves were large and powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
     From this spot he could see nearly the whole length of the strait, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     gazing up it in the direction he had come, he saw some boats crossing in
    </p>
    <p>
     the distance. As they moved so slowly, and appeared so broad, he
    </p>
    <p>
     conjectured that they were flat-bottomed punts, and, straining his eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
     he fancied he detected horses on board. He watched four cross, and
    </p>
    <p>
     presently the first punt returned, as if for another freight. He now
    </p>
    <p>
     noticed that there was a land route by which travellers or waggons came
    </p>
    <p>
     down from the northward, and crossed the strait by a ferry. It appeared
    </p>
    <p>
     that the ferry was not in the narrowest part of the strait, but nearer
    </p>
    <p>
     its western mouth, where the shores were flat, and covered with reeds
    </p>
    <p>
     and flags. He wondered that he had not seen anything of the
    </p>
    <p>
     landing-places, or of the ferry-boats, or some sign of this traffic when
    </p>
    <p>
     he passed, but concluded that the track was hidden among the dense
    </p>
    <p>
     growth of reed and flag, and that the punts, not being in use that day,
    </p>
    <p>
     had been drawn up, and perhaps covered with green boughs to shelter them
    </p>
    <p>
     from the heat of the summer sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact of this route existing, however, gave additional importance to
    </p>
    <p>
     the establishment of a fort on the shore of the strait, as he had so
    </p>
    <p>
     long contemplated. By now, the first punt had obtained another load, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was re-crossing the channel. It was evident that a caravan of travellers
    </p>
    <p>
     or merchants had arrived, such persons usually travelling in large
    </p>
    <p>
     bodies for safety, so that the routes were often deserted for weeks
    </p>
    <p>
     together, and then suddenly covered with people. Routes, indeed, they
    </p>
    <p>
     were, and not roads; mere tracks worn through the forest and over the
    </p>
    <p>
     hills, often impassable from floods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still further satisfied that his original idea of a castle here was
    </p>
    <p>
     founded on a correct estimate of the value of the spot, Felix resolved
    </p>
    <p>
     to keep the conception to himself, and not again to hazard it to others,
    </p>
    <p>
     who might despise him, but adopt his design. With one long last glance
    </p>
    <p>
     at the narrow streak of water which formed the central part, as it were,
    </p>
    <p>
     of his many plans, he descended the hill, and pushed off in the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     His course this time gave him much less trouble than the day before,
    </p>
    <p>
     when he had frequently to change his tack. The steady, strong breeze
    </p>
    <p>
     came off the land, to which he was too close for any waves to arise, and
    </p>
    <p>
     hour after hour passed without any necessity to shift the sail, further
    </p>
    <p>
     than to ease or tighten the sheets as the course of the land varied. By
    </p>
    <p>
     degrees the wind came more and more across his course, at right angles
    </p>
    <p>
     to it, and then began to fall aft as he described an arc, and the land
    </p>
    <p>
     projected northwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     He saw several small villages on the shore, and passed one narrow bay,
    </p>
    <p>
     which seemed, indeed, to penetrate into the land deeper than he could
    </p>
    <p>
     actually see. Suddenly, after four or five hours, sailing, he saw the
    </p>
    <p>
     tower of a church over the wooded hills. This he knew must indicate the
    </p>
    <p>
     position of Aisi. The question now came, whether he should sail into the
    </p>
    <p>
     harbour, when he would, of course, at once be seen, and have to undergo
    </p>
    <p>
     the examination of the officers; or should he land, and go on foot to
    </p>
    <p>
     the city? A minute's reflection assured him the latter was the better
    </p>
    <p>
     plan, for his canoe was of so unusual a construction, that it would be
    </p>
    <p>
     more than carefully examined, and not unlikely his little treasures
    </p>
    <p>
     would be discovered and appropriated. Without hesitation, therefore, and
    </p>
    <p>
     congratulating himself that there were no vessels in sight, he ran the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe on shore among the flags and reeds which bordered it.
    </p>
    <p>
     He drew her up as far as his strength permitted, and not only took down
    </p>
    <p>
     the sail, but unshipped the mast; then cutting a quantity of dead reeds,
    </p>
    <p>
     he scattered them over her, so that, unless a boat passed very close to
    </p>
    <p>
     the land, she would not be seen. While he had a meal he considered how
    </p>
    <p>
     he had better proceed. The only arms with which he excelled were the bow
    </p>
    <p>
     and arrow; clearly, therefore, if he wished an engagement, he should
    </p>
    <p>
     take these with him, and exhibit his skill. But well he knew the utter
    </p>
    <p>
     absence of law and justice except for the powerful. His bow, which he so
    </p>
    <p>
     greatly valued, and which was so well seasoned, and could be relied
    </p>
    <p>
     upon, might be taken from him.
    </p>
    <p>
     His arrows, so carefully prepared from chosen wood, and pointed with
    </p>
    <p>
     steel, might be seized. Both bow and arrows were far superior to those
    </p>
    <p>
     used by the hunters and soldiery, and he dreaded losing them. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     his crossbow, but it was weak, and intended for killing only small game,
    </p>
    <p>
     as birds, and at short range. He could make no display with that. Sword
    </p>
    <p>
     he had none for defence; there remained only his boar spear, and with
    </p>
    <p>
     this he resolved to be content, trusting to obtain the loan of a bow
    </p>
    <p>
     when the time came to display his skill, and that fortune would enable
    </p>
    <p>
     him to triumph with an inferior weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
     After resting awhile and stretching his limbs, cramped in the canoe, he
    </p>
    <p>
     set out (carrying his boar-spear only) along the shore, for the thick
    </p>
    <p>
     growth of the firs would not let him penetrate in the direction he had
    </p>
    <p>
     seen the tower. He had to force his way through the reeds and flags and
    </p>
    <p>
     brushwood, which flourished between the firs and the water's edge. It
    </p>
    <p>
     was hard work walking, or rather pushing through these obstacles, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     rejoiced when he emerged upon the slope of a down where there was an
    </p>
    <p>
     open sward, and but a few scattered groups of firs. The fact of it being
    </p>
    <p>
     open, and the shortness of the sward, showed at once that it was used
    </p>
    <p>
     for grazing purposes for cattle and sheep. Here he could walk freely,
    </p>
    <p>
     and soon reached the top. Thence the city was visible almost underneath
    </p>
    <p>
     him.
    </p>
    <p>
     It stood at the base of a low narrow promontory, which ran a long way
    </p>
    <p>
     into the Lake. The narrow bank, near where it joined the mainland, was
    </p>
    <p>
     penetrated by a channel or creek, about a hundred yards wide, or less,
    </p>
    <p>
     which channel appeared to enter the land and was lost from sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     among the trees. Beyond this channel a river ran into the lake, and in
    </p>
    <p>
     the Y, between the creek and the river, the city had been built.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was surrounded with a brick wall, and there were two large round
    </p>
    <p>
     brick towers on the land side, which indicated the position of the
    </p>
    <p>
     castle and palace. The space enclosed by the walls was not more than
    </p>
    <p>
     half a mile square, and the houses did not occupy nearly all of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were open places, gardens, and even small paddocks among them.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of the houses were more than two storeys high, but what at once
    </p>
    <p>
     struck a stranger was the fact that they were all roofed with red tiles,
    </p>
    <p>
     most of the houses of that day being thatched or covered with shingles
    </p>
    <p>
     of wood. As Felix afterwards learnt, this had been effected during the
    </p>
    <p>
     reign of the present king, whose object was to protect his city from
    </p>
    <p>
     being set on fire by burning arrows. The encircling wall had become a
    </p>
    <p>
     dull red hue from the long exposure to the weather, but the roofs were a
    </p>
    <p>
     brighter red. There was no ensign flying on either of the towers, from
    </p>
    <p>
     which he concluded that the king at that moment was absent.

    <p>
     THE CITY
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly descending towards the city, Felix looked in vain for any means
    </p>
    <p>
     of crossing the channel or creek, which extended upon the side of it,
    </p>
    <p>
     and in which he counted twenty-two merchant vessels at anchor, or moored
    </p>
    <p>
     to the bank, besides a number of smaller craft and boats. The ship of
    </p>
    <p>
     war, which had arrived before him, was beached close up by a gate of the
    </p>
    <p>
     city, which opened on the creek or port, and her crew were busily
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged discharging her stores. As he walked beside the creek trying to
    </p>
    <p>
     call the attention of some boatman to take him across, he was impressed
    </p>
    <p>
     by the silence, for though the city wall was not much more than a
    </p>
    <p>
     stone's throw distant, there was none of the usual hum which arises from
    </p>
    <p>
     the movements of people. On looking closer he noticed, too, that there
    </p>
    <p>
     were few persons on the merchant vessels, and not one gang at work
    </p>
    <p>
     loading or unloading. Except the warder stalking to and fro on the wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the crew of the war-ship, there was no one visible. As the warder
    </p>
    <p>
     paced to and fro the blade of his partisan gleamed in the sunshine. He
    </p>
    <p>
     must have seen Felix, but with military indifference did not pay the
    </p>
    <p>
     slightest heed to the latter's efforts to attract his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     He now passed the war-ship, and shouted to the men at work, who were, he
    </p>
    <p>
     could see, carrying sheaves of arrows and bundles of javelins from the
    </p>
    <p>
     vessel and placing them on carts; but they did not trouble to reply. His
    </p>
    <p>
     common dress and ordinary appearance did not inspire them with any hope
    </p>
    <p>
     of payment from him if they obliged him with a boat. The utter
    </p>
    <p>
     indifference with which his approach was seen showed him the contempt in
    </p>
    <p>
     which he was held.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking round to see if there were no bridge or ferry, he caught sight
    </p>
    <p>
     of the grey church tower which he had observed from afar while sailing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was quite a mile from the city, and isolated outside the walls. It
    </p>
    <p>
     stood on the slope of the hill, over whose summit the tower was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
     He wandered up towards it, as there were usually people in or about the
    </p>
    <p>
     churches, which were always open day and night. If no one else, the
    </p>
    <p>
     porter in the lodge at the church door would be there, for he or his
    </p>
    <p>
     representative never left it, being always on the watch lest some thief
    </p>
    <p>
     should attempt to enter the treasury, or steal the sacred vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as he ascended the hill he met a shepherd, whose dogs prepared to
    </p>
    <p>
     fly at him, recognising a stranger. For a moment the man seemed inclined
    </p>
    <p>
     to let them wreak their will, if they could, for he also felt inclined
    </p>
    <p>
     to challenge a stranger, but, seeing Felix lower his spear, it probably
    </p>
    <p>
     occurred to him that some of his dogs would be killed. He therefore
    </p>
    <p>
     ordered them down, and stayed to listen. Felix learnt that there was no
    </p>
    <p>
     bridge across the creek, and only one over the river; but there was a
    </p>
    <p>
     ferry for anybody who was known. No strangers were allowed to cross the
    </p>
    <p>
     ferry; they must enter by the main road over the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But how am I to get into the place then?" said Felix. The shepherd
    </p>
    <p>
     shook his head, and said he could not tell him, and walked away about
    </p>
    <p>
     his business.
    </p>
    <p>
     Discouraged at these trifling vexations, which seemed to cross his path
    </p>
    <p>
     at every step, Felix found his way to the ferry, but, as the shepherd
    </p>
    <p>
     had said, the boatman refused to carry him, being a stranger. No
    </p>
    <p>
     persuasion could move him; nor the offer of a small silver coin, worth
    </p>
    <p>
     about ten times his fare.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I must then swim across," said Felix, preparing to take off his
    </p>
    <p>
     clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Swim, if you like," said the boatman, with a grim smile; "but you will
    </p>
    <p>
     never land."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because the warder will let drive at you with an arrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix looked, and saw that he was opposite the extreme angle of the city
    </p>
    <p>
     wall, a point usually guarded with care. There was a warder stalking to
    </p>
    <p>
     and fro; he carried a partisan, but, of course, might have his bow
    </p>
    <p>
     within reach, or could probably call to the soldiers of the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This is annoying," said Felix, ready to give up his enterprise. "How
    </p>
    <p>
     ever can I get into the city?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The old boatman grinned, but said nothing, and returned to a net which
    </p>
    <p>
     he was mending. He made no answer to the further questions Felix put to
    </p>
    <p>
     him. Felix then shouted to the warder; the soldier looked once, but paid
    </p>
    <p>
     no more heed. Felix walked a little way and sat down on the grass. He
    </p>
    <p>
     was deeply discouraged. These repulses, trifles in themselves, assumed
    </p>
    <p>
     an importance, because his mind had long been strung up to a high pitch
    </p>
    <p>
     of tension. A stolid man would have thought nothing of them. After a
    </p>
    <p>
     while he arose, again asking himself how should he become a leader, who
    </p>
    <p>
     had not the perseverance to enter a city in peaceful guise?
    </p>
    <p>
     Not knowing what else to do, he followed the creek round the foot of the
    </p>
    <p>
     hill, and so onwards for a mile or more. This bank was steep, on account
    </p>
    <p>
     of the down; the other cultivated, the corn being already high. The
    </p>
    <p>
     cuckoo sang (she loves the near neighbourhood of man) and flew over the
    </p>
    <p>
     channel towards a little copse. Almost suddenly the creek wound round
    </p>
    <p>
     under a low chalk cliff, and in a moment Felix found himself confronted
    </p>
    <p>
     by another city. This had no wall; it was merely defended by a ditch and
    </p>
    <p>
     earthwork, without tower or bastion.
    </p>
    <p>
     The houses were placed thickly together; there were, he thought, six or
    </p>
    <p>
     seven times as many as he had previously seen, and they were thatched or
    </p>
    <p>
     shingled, like those in his own country. It stood in the midst of the
    </p>
    <p>
     fields, and the corn came up to the fosse; there were many people at
    </p>
    <p>
     work, but, as he noticed, most of them were old men, bowed and feeble. A
    </p>
    <p>
     little way farther he saw a second boathouse; he hastened thither, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the ferrywoman, for the boat was poled across by a stout dame, made not
    </p>
    <p>
     the least difficulty about ferrying him over. So delighted was Felix at
    </p>
    <p>
     this unexpected fortune, that he gave her the small silver coin, at
    </p>
    <p>
     sight of which he instantly rose high in her estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She explained to him, in answer to his inquiries, that this was also
    </p>
    <p>
     called Aisi; this was the city of the common folk. Those who were rich
    </p>
    <p>
     or powerful had houses in the walled city, the precinct of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of the houses there, too, were the inns of great families who dwelt
    </p>
    <p>
     in the country in their castles, but when they came to the Court
    </p>
    <p>
     required a house. Their shields, or coats of arms, were painted over the
    </p>
    <p>
     doors. The walled city was guarded with such care, because so many
    </p>
    <p>
     attempts had been made to surprise it, and to assassinate the king,
    </p>
    <p>
     whose fiery disposition and constant wars had raised him up so many
    </p>
    <p>
     enemies. As much care was taken to prevent a single stranger entering as
    </p>
    <p>
     if he were the vanguard of a hostile army, and if he now went back (as
    </p>
    <p>
     he could do) to the bridge over the river, he would be stopped and
    </p>
    <p>
     questioned, and possibly confined in prison till the king returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where is the king?" asked Felix; "I came to try and take service with
    </p>
    <p>
     him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then you will be welcome," said the woman. "He is in the field, and has
    </p>
    <p>
     just sat down before Iwis."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That was why the walled city seemed so empty, then." said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes; all the people are with him; there will be a great battle this
    </p>
    <p>
     time."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How far is it to Iwis?" said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Twenty-seven miles," replied the dame; "and if you take my advice, you
    </p>
    <p>
     had better walk twenty-seven miles there, than two miles back to the
    </p>
    <p>
     bridge over the river."
    </p>
    <p>
     Someone now called from the opposite bank, and she started with the boat
    </p>
    <p>
     to fetch another passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank you, very much," said Felix, as he wished her good day; "but why
    </p>
    <p>
     did not the man at the other ferry tell me I could cross here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman laughed outright. "Do you suppose he was going to put a penny
    </p>
    <p>
     in my way when he could not get it himself?"
    </p>
    <p>
     So mean and petty is the world! Felix entered the second city and walked
    </p>
    <p>
     some distance through it, when he recollected that he had not eaten for
    </p>
    <p>
     some time. He looked in vain for an inn, but upon speaking to a man who
    </p>
    <p>
     was leaning on his crutch at a doorway, he was at once asked to enter,
    </p>
    <p>
     and all that the house afforded was put before him. The man with the
    </p>
    <p>
     crutch sat down opposite, and remarked that most of the folk were gone
    </p>
    <p>
     to the camp, but he could not because his foot had been injured. He then
    </p>
    <p>
     went on to tell how it had happened, with the usual garrulity of the
    </p>
    <p>
     wounded. He was assisting to place the beam of a battering-ram upon a
    </p>
    <p>
     truck (it took ten horses to draw it) when a lever snapped, and the beam
    </p>
    <p>
     fell. Had the beam itself touched him he would have been killed on the
    </p>
    <p>
     spot; as it was, only a part of the broken lever or pole hit him. Thrown
    </p>
    <p>
     with such force, the weight of the ram driving it, the fragment of the
    </p>
    <p>
     pole grazed his leg, and either broke one of the small bones that form
    </p>
    <p>
     the arch of the instep, or so bruised it that it was worse than broken.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the bone-setters and surgeons had gone to the camp, and he was left
    </p>
    <p>
     without attendance other than the women, who fomented the foot daily,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he had little hope of present recovery, knowing that such things
    </p>
    <p>
     were often months about.
    </p>
    <p>
     He thought it lucky that it was no worse, for very few, he had noticed,
    </p>
    <p>
     ever recovered from serious wounds of spear or arrow. The wounded
    </p>
    <p>
     generally died; only the fortunate escaped. Thus he ran on, talking as
    </p>
    <p>
     much for his own amusement as that of his guest. He fretted because he
    </p>
    <p>
     could not join the camp and help work the artillery; he supposed the ram
    </p>
    <p>
     would be in position by now and shaking the wall with its blow. He
    </p>
    <p>
     wondered if Baron Ingulph would miss his face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who's he?" asked Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He is captain of the artillery," replied his host.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you his retainer?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No; I am a servant."
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix started slightly, and did but just check himself from rising from
    </p>
    <p>
     the table. A "servant" was a slave; it was the euphemism used instead of
    </p>
    <p>
     the hateful word, which not even the most degraded can endure to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
     The class of the nobles to which he belonged deemed it a disgrace to sit
    </p>
    <p>
     down with a slave, to eat with him, even to accidently touch him. With
    </p>
    <p>
     the retainers, or free men, they were on familiar terms, though despotic
    </p>
    <p>
     to the last degree; the slave was less than the dog. Then, stealing a
    </p>
    <p>
     glance at the man's face, Felix saw that he had no moustache; he had not
    </p>
    <p>
     noticed this before. No slaves were allowed to wear the moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
     This man having been at home ill some days had neglected to shave, and
    </p>
    <p>
     there was some mark upon his upper lip. As he caught his guest's glance,
    </p>
    <p>
     the slave hung his head, and asked his guest in a low and humble voice
    </p>
    <p>
     not to mention this fault. With his face slightly flushed, Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     finished his meal; he was confused to the last degree. His long training
    </p>
    <p>
     and the tone of the society in which he had moved (though so despised a
    </p>
    <p>
     member of it) prejudiced him strongly against the man whose hospitality
    </p>
    <p>
     was so welcome. On the other hand, the ideas which had for so long
    </p>
    <p>
     worked in his mind in his solitary intercommunings in the forest were
    </p>
    <p>
     entirely opposed to servitude. In abstract principle he had long since
    </p>
    <p>
     condemned it, and desired to abolish it. But here was the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had eaten at a slave's table, and sat with him face to face. Theory
    </p>
    <p>
     and practice are often strangely at variance. He felt it an important
    </p>
    <p>
     moment; he felt that he was himself, as it were, on the balance; should
    </p>
    <p>
     he adhere to the ancient prejudice, the ancient exclusiveness of his
    </p>
    <p>
     class, or should he boldly follow the dictate of his mind? He chose the
    </p>
    <p>
     latter, and extended his hand to the servant as he rose to say good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     The act was significant; it recognised man as distinct from caste. The
    </p>
    <p>
     servant did not know the conflict that had taken place; but to be shaken
    </p>
    <p>
     hands with at all, even by a retainer as he supposed Felix to be, was
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed a surprise. He could not understand it; it was the first time his
    </p>
    <p>
     hand had been taken by any one of superior position since he had been
    </p>
    <p>
     born. He was dumb with amazement, and could scarcely point out the road
    </p>
    <p>
     when asked; nor did he take the small coin Felix offered, one of the few
    </p>
    <p>
     he possessed. Felix therefore left it on the table and again started.
    </p>
    <p>
     Passing through the town, Felix followed the track which led in the
    </p>
    <p>
     direction indicated. In about half a mile it led him to a wider track,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he immediately recognised as the main way and road to the camp by
    </p>
    <p>
     the ruts and dust, for the sward had been trampled down for fifty yards
    </p>
    <p>
     wide, and even the corn was cut up by wheels and horses' hoofs. The army
    </p>
    <p>
     had passed, and he had but to follow its unmistakable trail.
    </p>

     CHAPTER XVII

    <p>
     THE CAMP
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix walked steadily on for nearly three hours, when the rough track,
    </p>
    <p>
     the dust, and heat began to tell upon him, and he sat down beside the
    </p>
    <p>
     way. The sun was now declining, and the long June day tending to its
    </p>
    <p>
     end. A horseman passed, coming from the camp, and as he wore only a
    </p>
    <p>
     sword, and had a leathern bag slung from his shoulder, he appeared to be
    </p>
    <p>
     a courtier. The dust raised by the hoofs, as it rose and floated above
    </p>
    <p>
     the brushwood, rendered his course visible. Some time afterwards, while
    </p>
    <p>
     he still rested, being very weary with walking through the heat of the
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon, he heard the sound of wheels, and two carts drawn by horses
    </p>
    <p>
     came along the track from the city.
    </p>
    <p>
     The carts were laden with bundles of arrows, perhaps the same he had
    </p>
    <p>
     seen unloading that morning from the war-ship, and were accompanied only
    </p>
    <p>
     by carters. As they approached he rose, feeling that it was time to
    </p>
    <p>
     continue his journey. His tired feet were now stiff, and he limped as he
    </p>
    <p>
     stepped out into the road. The men spoke, and he walked as well as he
    </p>
    <p>
     could beside them, using his boar-spear as a staff. There were two
    </p>
    <p>
     carters with each cart; and presently, noting how he lagged, and could
    </p>
    <p>
     scarce keep pace with them, one of them took a wooden bottle from the
    </p>
    <p>
     load on his cart, and offered him a draught of ale.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus somewhat refreshed, Felix began to talk, and learnt that the arrows
    </p>
    <p>
     were from the vessel in whose track he had sailed; that it had been sent
    </p>
    <p>
     loaded with stores for the king's use, by his friend the Prince of
    </p>
    <p>
     Quinton; that very great efforts had been made to get together a large
    </p>
    <p>
     army in this campaign; first, because the city besieged was so near
    </p>
    <p>
     home, and failure might be disastrous, and, secondly, because it was one
    </p>
    <p>
     of three which were all republics, and the other two would be certain to
    </p>
    <p>
     send it assistance. These cities stood in a plain, but a few miles
    </p>
    <p>
     apart, and in a straight line on the banks of the river. The king had
    </p>
    <p>
     just sat down before the first, vowing that he would knock them down,
    </p>
    <p>
     one after the other, like a row of ninepins.
    </p>
    <p>
     The carters asked him, in return, whose retainer he was, and he said
    </p>
    <p>
     that he was on his way to take service, and was under no banner yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then," said the man who had given him a drink, "if you are free like
    </p>
    <p>
     that, you had better join the king's levy, and be careful to avoid the
    </p>
    <p>
     barons' war. For if you join either of the barons' war, they will know
    </p>
    <p>
     you to be a stranger, and very likely, if they see that you are quick
    </p>
    <p>
     and active, they will not let you free again, and if you attempt to
    </p>
    <p>
     escape after the campaign, you will find yourself mightily mistaken. The
    </p>
    <p>
     baron's captain would only have to say you had always been his man; and,
    </p>
    <p>
     as for your word, it would be no more than a dog's bark. Besides which,
    </p>
    <p>
     if you rebelled, it would be only to shave off that moustache of yours,
    </p>
    <p>
     and declare you a slave, and as you have no friends in camp, a slave you
    </p>
    <p>
     would be."
    </p>
    <p>
     "That would be very unjust," said Felix. "Surely the king would not
    </p>
    <p>
     allow it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "How is he to know?" said another of the carters. "My brother's boy was
    </p>
    <p>
     served just like that. He was born free, the same as all our family, but
    </p>
    <p>
     he was fond of roving, and when he reached Quinton, he was seen by Baron
    </p>
    <p>
     Robert, who was in want of men, and being a likely young fellow, they
    </p>
    <p>
     shaved his lip, and forced him to labour under the thong. When his
    </p>
    <p>
     spirit was cowed, and he seemed reconciled, they let him grow his
    </p>
    <p>
     moustache again, and there he is now, a retainer, and well treated. But
    </p>
    <p>
     still, it was against his will. Jack is right; you had better join the
    </p>
    <p>
     king's levy."
    </p>
    <p>
     The king's levy is composed of his own retainers from his estates, of
    </p>
    <p>
     townsmen, who are not retainers of the barons, of any knights and
    </p>
    <p>
     volunteers who like to offer their services; and a king always desires
    </p>
    <p>
     as large a levy as possible, because it enables him to overawe his
    </p>
    <p>
     barons. These, when their "war", or forces, are collected together in
    </p>
    <p>
     camp, are often troublesome, and inclined to usurp authority. A
    </p>
    <p>
     volunteer is, therefore, always welcome in the king's levy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix thanked them for the information they had given him, and said he
    </p>
    <p>
     should certainly follow their advice. He could now hardly keep up with
    </p>
    <p>
     the carts, having walked for so many hours, and undergone so much
    </p>
    <p>
     previous exertion. Finding this to be the case, he wished them
    </p>
    <p>
     good-night, and looked round for some cover. It was now dusk, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     knew he could go no farther. When they understood his intention, they
    </p>
    <p>
     consulted among themselves, and finally made him get up into one of the
    </p>
    <p>
     carts, and sit down on the bundles of arrows, which filled it like
    </p>
    <p>
     faggots. Thus he was jolted along, the rude wheels fitting but badly on
    </p>
    <p>
     the axle, and often sinking deep into a rut.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were now in thick forest, and the track was much narrower, so that
    </p>
    <p>
     it had become worn into a hollow, as if it were the dry bed of a
    </p>
    <p>
     torrent. The horses and the carters were weary, yet they were obliged to
    </p>
    <p>
     plod on, as the arms had to be delivered before the morrow. They spoke
    </p>
    <p>
     little, except to urge the animals. Felix soon dropped into a reclining
    </p>
    <p>
     posture (uneasy as it was, it was a relief), and looking up, saw the
    </p>
    <p>
     white summer stars above. After a time he lost consciousness, and slept
    </p>
    <p>
     soundly, quite worn out, despite the jolting and creaking of the wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of a trumpet woke him with a start. His heavy and dreamless
    </p>
    <p>
     sleep for a moment had taken away his memory, and he did not know where
    </p>
    <p>
     he was. As he sat up two sacks fell from him; the carters had thrown
    </p>
    <p>
     them over him as a protection against the night's dew. The summer
    </p>
    <p>
     morning was already as bright as noonday, and the camp about him was
    </p>
    <p>
     astir. In half a minute he came to himself, and getting out of the cart
    </p>
    <p>
     looked round. All his old interest had returned, the spirit of war
    </p>
    <p>
     entered into him, the trumpet sounded again, and the morning breeze
    </p>
    <p>
     extended the many-coloured banners.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spot where he stood was in the rear of the main camp, and but a
    </p>
    <p>
     short distance from the unbroken forest. Upon either hand there was an
    </p>
    <p>
     intermingled mass of stores, carts, and waggons crowded together, sacks
    </p>
    <p>
     and huge heaps of forage, on and about which scores of slaves, drivers
    </p>
    <p>
     and others, were sleeping in every possible attitude, many of them
    </p>
    <p>
     evidently still under the influence of the ale they had drunk the night
    </p>
    <p>
     before. What struck him at once was the absence of any guard here in the
    </p>
    <p>
     rear. The enemy might steal out from the forest behind and help himself
    </p>
    <p>
     to what he chose, or murder the sleeping men, or, passing through the
    </p>
    <p>
     stores, fall on the camp itself. To Felix this neglect appeared
    </p>
    <p>
     inexplicable; it indicated a mental state which he could not comprehend,
    </p>
    <p>
     a state only to be described by negatives. There was no completeness, no
    </p>
    <p>
     system, no organization; it was a kind of haphazardness, altogether
    </p>
    <p>
     opposite to his own clear and well-ordered ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ground sloped gently downwards from the edge of the forest, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     place where he was had probably been ploughed, but was now trodden flat
    </p>
    <p>
     and hard. Next in front of the stores he observed a long, low hut built
    </p>
    <p>
     of poles, and roofed with fir branches; the walls were formed of ferns,
    </p>
    <p>
     straw, bundles of hay, anything that had come to hand. On a standard
    </p>
    <p>
     beside it, a pale blue banner, with the device of a double hammer worked
    </p>
    <p>
     in gold upon it, fluttered in the wind. Twenty or thirty, perhaps more,
    </p>
    <p>
     spears leant against one end of this rude shed, their bright points
    </p>
    <p>
     projecting yards above the roof. To the right of the booth as many
    </p>
    <p>
     horses were picketed, and not far from them some soldiers were cooking
    </p>
    <p>
     at an open fire of logs. As Felix came slowly towards the booth, winding
    </p>
    <p>
     in and out among the carts and heaps of sacks, he saw that similar
    </p>
    <p>
     erections extended down the slope for a long distance.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were hundreds of them, some large, some small, not placed in any
    </p>
    <p>
     order, but pitched where chance or fancy led, the first-comers taking
    </p>
    <p>
     the sites that pleased them, and the rest crowding round. Beside each
    </p>
    <p>
     hut stood the banner of the owner, and Felix knew from this that they
    </p>
    <p>
     were occupied by the barons, knights, and captains of the army. The
    </p>
    <p>
     retainers of each baron bivouacked as they might in the open air; some
    </p>
    <p>
     of them had hunter's hides, and others used bundles of straw to sleep
    </p>
    <p>
     on. Their fire was as close to their lord's hut as convenient, and thus
    </p>
    <p>
     there were always plenty within call.
    </p>
    <p>
     The servants, or slaves, also slept in the open air, but in the rear of
    </p>
    <p>
     their owner's booth, and apart from the free retainers. Felix noticed,
    </p>
    <p>
     that although the huts were pitched anyhow and anywhere, those on the
    </p>
    <p>
     lowest ground seemed built along a line, and, looking closer, he found
    </p>
    <p>
     that a small stream ran there. He learnt afterwards that there was
    </p>
    <p>
     usually an emulation among the commanders to set up their standards as
    </p>
    <p>
     near the water as possible, on account of convenience, those in the rear
    </p>
    <p>
     having often to lead their horses a long distance to water. Beyond the
    </p>
    <p>
     stream the ground rose again as gradually as it had declined. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     open and cultivated up to the walls of the besieged city, which was not
    </p>
    <p>
     three-quarters of a mile distant. Felix could not for the moment
    </p>
    <p>
     distinguish the king's head-quarters. The confused manner in which the
    </p>
    <p>
     booths were built prevented him from seeing far, though from the higher
    </p>
    <p>
     ground it was easy to look over their low roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
     He now wandered into the centre of the camp, and saw with astonishment
    </p>
    <p>
     groups of retainers everywhere eating, drinking, talking, and even
    </p>
    <p>
     playing cards or dice, but not a single officer of any rank. At last,
    </p>
    <p>
     stopping by the embers of a fire, he asked timidly if he might have
    </p>
    <p>
     breakfast. The soldiers laughed and pointed to a cart behind them,
    </p>
    <p>
     telling him to help himself. The cart was turned with the tail towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the fire, and laden with bread and sides of bacon, slices of which the
    </p>
    <p>
     retainers had been toasting at the embers.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did as he was bid, and the next minute a soldier, not quite steady on
    </p>
    <p>
     his legs even at that hour, offered him the can, "for," said he, "you
    </p>
    <p>
     had best drink whilst you may, youngster. There is always plenty of
    </p>
    <p>
     drink and good living at the beginning of a war, and very often not a
    </p>
    <p>
     drop or a bite to be got in the middle of it." Listening to their talk
    </p>
    <p>
     as he ate his breakfast, Felix found the reason there were no officers
    </p>
    <p>
     about was because most of them had drunk too freely the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     The king himself, they said, was put to bed as tight as a drum, and it
    </p>
    <p>
     took no small quantity to fill so huge a vessel, for he was a remarkably
    </p>
    <p>
     big man.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the fatigue of the recent march, they had, in fact, refreshed
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves, and washed down the dust of the track. They thought that
    </p>
    <p>
     this siege was likely to be a very tough business, and congratulated
    </p>
    <p>
     themselves that it was not thirty miles to Aisi, so that so long as they
    </p>
    <p>
     stayed there they might, perhaps, get supplies of provisions with
    </p>
    <p>
     tolerable regularity. "But if you're over the water, my lad," said the
    </p>
    <p>
     old fellow with the can, picking his teeth with a twig, "and have got to
    </p>
    <p>
     get your victuals by ship; by George, you may have to eat grass, or gnaw
    </p>
    <p>
     boughs like a horse."
    </p>
    <p>
     None of these men wore any arms, except the inevitable knife; their arms
    </p>
    <p>
     were piled against the adjacent booth, bows and quivers, spears, swords,
    </p>
    <p>
     bills and darts, thrown together just as they had cast them aside, and
    </p>
    <p>
     more or less rusty from the dew. Felix thought that had the enemy come
    </p>
    <p>
     suddenly down in force they might have made a clean sweep of the camp,
    </p>
    <p>
     for there were no defences, neither breastwork, nor fosse, nor any set
    </p>
    <p>
     guard. But he forgot that the enemy were quite as ill-organized as the
    </p>
    <p>
     besiegers; probably they were in still greater confusion, for King
    </p>
    <p>
     Isembard was considered one of the greatest military commanders of his
    </p>
    <p>
     age, if not the very greatest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only sign of discipline he saw was the careful grooming of some
    </p>
    <p>
     horses, which he rightly guessed to be those ridden by the knights, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the equally careful polishing of pieces of armour before the doors of
    </p>
    <p>
     the huts. He wished now to inquire his way to the king's levy, but as
    </p>
    <p>
     the question rose to his lips he checked himself, remembering the
    </p>
    <p>
     caution the friendly carters had given him. He therefore determined to
    </p>
    <p>
     walk about the camp till he found some evidence that he was in the
    </p>
    <p>
     immediate neighbourhood of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
     He rose, stood about a little while to allay any possible suspicion
    </p>
    <p>
     (quite needless precautions, for the soldiers were far too agreeably
    </p>
    <p>
     engaged to take the least notice of him), and then sauntered off with as
    </p>
    <p>
     careless an air as he could assume. Looking about him, first at a forge
    </p>
    <p>
     where the blacksmith was shoeing a horse, then at a grindstone, where a
    </p>
    <p>
     knight's sword was being sharpened, he was nearly knocked down by a
    </p>
    <p>
     horse, urged at some speed through the crowds. By a rope from the
    </p>
    <p>
     collar, three dead bodies were drawn along the ground, dusty and
    </p>
    <p>
     disfigured by bumping against stone and clod. They were those of slaves,
    </p>
    <p>
     hanged the preceding day, perhaps for pilfering, perhaps for a mere
    </p>
    <p>
     whim, since every baron had power of the gallows.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were dragged through the camp, and out a few hundred yards beyond,
    </p>
    <p>
     and there left to the crows. This horrible sight, to which the rest were
    </p>
    <p>
     so accustomed and so indifferent that they did not even turn to look at
    </p>
    <p>
     it, deeply shocked him; the drawn and distorted features, the tongues
    </p>
    <p>
     protruding and literally licking the dust, haunted him for long after.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though his father, as a baron, possessed the same power, it had never
    </p>
    <p>
     been exercised during his tenure of the estate, so that Felix had not
    </p>
    <p>
     been hardened to the sight of executions, common enough elsewhere. Upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the Old House estate a species of negative humanity reigned; if the
    </p>
    <p>
     slaves were not emancipated, they were not hanged or cruelly beaten for
    </p>
    <p>
     trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hastening from the spot, Felix came across the artillery, which
    </p>
    <p>
     consisted of battering rams and immense crossbows; the bows were made
    </p>
    <p>
     from entire trees, or, more properly, poles. He inspected these clumsy
    </p>
    <p>
     contrivances with interest, and entered into a conversation with some
    </p>
    <p>
     men who were fitting up the framework on which a battering ram was to
    </p>
    <p>
     swing. Being extremely conceited with themselves and the knowledge they
    </p>
    <p>
     had acquired from experience only (as the repeated blows of the block
    </p>
    <p>
     drive home the pile), they scarcely answered him. But, presently, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     lent a hand to assist, and bore with their churlishness without reply,
    </p>
    <p>
     they softened, and, as usual, asked him to drink, for here, and
    </p>
    <p>
     throughout the camp, the ale was plentiful, too plentiful for much
    </p>
    <p>
     progress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix took the opportunity and suggested a new form of trigger for the
    </p>
    <p>
     unwieldy crossbows. He saw that as at present discharged it must require
    </p>
    <p>
     some strength, perhaps the united effort of several men, to pull away
    </p>
    <p>
     the bolt or catch. Such an effort must disconcert the aim; these
    </p>
    <p>
     crossbows were worked upon a carriage, and it was difficult to keep the
    </p>
    <p>
     carriage steady even when stakes were inserted by the low wheels. It
    </p>
    <p>
     occurred to him at once that the catch could be depressed by a lever, so
    </p>
    <p>
     that one man could discharge the bow by a mere pressure of the hand, and
    </p>
    <p>
     without interfering with the aim. The men soon understood him, and
    </p>
    <p>
     acknowledged that it would be a great improvement. One, who was the
    </p>
    <p>
     leader of the gang, thought it so valuable an idea that he went off at
    </p>
    <p>
     once to communicate with the lieutenant, who would in his turn carry the
    </p>
    <p>
     matter to Baron Ingulph, Master of the Artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
     The others congratulated him, and asked to share in the reward that
    </p>
    <p>
     would be given to him for this invention. To whose "war" did he belong?
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix answered, after a little hesitation, to the king's levy. At this
    </p>
    <p>
     they whispered among themselves, and Felix, again remembering the
    </p>
    <p>
     carters' caution, said that he must attend the muster (this was a pure
    </p>
    <p>
     guess), but that he would return directly afterwards. Never for a moment
    </p>
    <p>
     suspecting that he would avoid the reward they looked upon as certain,
    </p>
    <p>
     they made no opposition, and he hurried away. Pushing through the
    </p>
    <p>
     groups, and not in the least knowing where he was going, Felix stumbled
    </p>
    <p>
     at last upon the king's quarters.

     CHAPTER XVIII
    </head>
    <p>
     THE KING'S LEVY
    </p>
    <p>
     The king's booth stood apart from the rest; it was not much larger, but
    </p>
    <p>
     properly thatched with straw, and the wide doorway hung with purple
    </p>
    <p>
     curtains. Two standards stood beside it; one much higher than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tallest bore the ensign of the kingdom; the lesser, the king's own
    </p>
    <p>
     private banner as a knight. A breastwork encircled the booth, enclosing
    </p>
    <p>
     a space about seventy yards in diameter, with a fosse, and stakes so
    </p>
    <p>
     planted as to repel assailants. There was but one gateway, opposite the
    </p>
    <p>
     general camp, and this was guarded by soldiers fully armed. A knight on
    </p>
    <p>
     horseback in armour, except his helmet, rode slowly up and down before
    </p>
    <p>
     the gate; he was the officer of the guard. His retainers, some thirty or
    </p>
    <p>
     forty men, were drawn up close by.
    </p>
    <p>
     A distance of fifty yards intervened between this entrenchment and the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp, and was kept clear. Within the entrenchment Felix could see a
    </p>
    <p>
     number of gentlemen, and several horses caparisoned, but from the
    </p>
    <p>
     absence of noise and the fact that every one appeared to walk daintily
    </p>
    <p>
     and on tiptoe, he concluded that the king was still sleeping. The stream
    </p>
    <p>
     ran beside the entrenchment, and between it and the city; the king's
    </p>
    <p>
     quarters were at that corner of the camp highest up the brook, so that
    </p>
    <p>
     the water might not be fouled before it reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The king's levy, however, did not seem to be hereabouts, for the booths
    </p>
    <p>
     nearest the head-quarters were evidently occupied by great barons, as
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix easily knew from their banners. There was here some little
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance of formality; the soldiery were not so noisy, and there were
    </p>
    <p>
     several officers moving among them. He afterwards discovered that the
    </p>
    <p>
     greater barons claimed the right to camp nearest the king, and that the
    </p>
    <p>
     king's levy was just behind their booths. But unable to discover the
    </p>
    <p>
     place, and afraid of losing his liberty if he delayed longer, Felix,
    </p>
    <p>
     after hesitating some time, determined to apply direct to the guard at
    </p>
    <p>
     the gate of the circular entrenchment.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he crossed the open ground towards it, he noticed that the king's
    </p>
    <p>
     quarters were the closest to the enemy. Across the little stream were
    </p>
    <p>
     some corn-fields, and beyond these the walls of the city, scarcely half
    </p>
    <p>
     a mile distant. There was no outpost, the stream was but a brook, and
    </p>
    <p>
     could be crossed with ease. He marvelled at the lack of precaution; but
    </p>
    <p>
     he had yet to learn that the enemy, and all the armies of the age, were
    </p>
    <p>
     equally ignorant and equally careless.
    </p>
    <p>
     With as humble a demeanour as he could assume, Felix doffed his cap and
    </p>
    <p>
     began to speak to the guard at the gateway of the entrenchment. The
    </p>
    <p>
     nearest man-at-arms immediately raised his spear and struck him with the
    </p>
    <p>
     butt. The unexpected blow fell on his left shoulder, and with such force
    </p>
    <p>
     as to render it powerless. Before he could utter a remonstrance, a
    </p>
    <p>
     second had seized his boar-spear, snapped the handle across his knee,
    </p>
    <p>
     and hurled the fragments from him. Others then took him by the shoulders
    </p>
    <p>
     and thrust him back across the open space to the camp, where they kicked
    </p>
    <p>
     him and left him, bruised, and almost stupefied with indignation. His
    </p>
    <p>
     offence was approaching the king's ground with arms in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later in the afternoon he found himself sitting on the bank of the
    </p>
    <p>
     stream far below the camp. He had wandered thither without knowing where
    </p>
    <p>
     he was going or what he was doing. His spirit for the time had been
    </p>
    <p>
     crushed, not so much by the physical brutality as by the repulse to his
    </p>
    <p>
     aspirations. Full of high hopes, and conscious of great ideas, he had
    </p>
    <p>
     been beaten like a felon hound.
    </p>
    <p>
     From this spot beside the brook the distant camp appeared very
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful. The fluttering banners, the green roofs of the booths (of
    </p>
    <p>
     ferns and reeds and boughs), the movement and life, for bodies of troops
    </p>
    <p>
     were now marching to and fro, and knights in gay attire riding on
    </p>
    <p>
     horseback, made a pleasant scene on the sloping ground with the forest
    </p>
    <p>
     at the back. Over the stream the sunshine lit up the walls of the
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened city, where, too, many flags were waving. Felix came somewhat
    </p>
    <p>
     to himself as he gazed, and presently acknowledged that he had only had
    </p>
    <p>
     himself to blame. He had evidently transgressed a rule, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     ignorance of the rule was no excuse, since those who had any right to be
    </p>
    <p>
     in the camp at all were supposed to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
     He got up, and returning slowly towards the camp, passed on his way the
    </p>
    <p>
     drinking-place, where a groom was watering some horses. The man called
    </p>
    <p>
     to him to help hold a spirited charger, and Felix mechanically did as he
    </p>
    <p>
     was asked. The fellow's mates had left him to do their work, and there
    </p>
    <p>
     were too many horses for him to manage. Felix led the charger for him
    </p>
    <p>
     back to the camp, and in return was asked to drink. He preferred food,
    </p>
    <p>
     and a plentiful supply was put before him. The groom, gossiping as he
    </p>
    <p>
     attended to his duties, said that he always welcomed the beginning of a
    </p>
    <p>
     war, for they were often half starved, and had to gnaw the bones, like
    </p>
    <p>
     the dogs, in peace. But when war was declared, vast quantities of
    </p>
    <p>
     provisions were got together, and everybody gorged at their will. The
    </p>
    <p>
     very dogs battened; he pointed to half a dozen who were tearing a raw
    </p>
    <p>
     shoulder of mutton to pieces. Before the campaign was over, those very
    </p>
    <p>
     dogs might starve. To what "war" did Felix belong? He replied to the
    </p>
    <p>
     king's levy.
    </p>
    <p>
     The groom said that this was the king's levy where they were; but under
    </p>
    <p>
     whose command was he? This puzzled Felix, who did not know what to say,
    </p>
    <p>
     and ended by telling the truth, and begging the fellow to advise him, as
    </p>
    <p>
     he feared to lose his liberty. The man said he had better stay where he
    </p>
    <p>
     was, and serve with him under Master Lacy, who was mean enough in the
    </p>
    <p>
     city, but liked to appear liberal when thus consorting with knights and
    </p>
    <p>
     gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Master Lacy was a merchant of Aisi, an owner of vessels. Like most of
    </p>
    <p>
     his fellows, when war came so close home, he was almost obliged to join
    </p>
    <p>
     the king's levy. Had he not done so it would have been recorded against
    </p>
    <p>
     him as a lack of loyalty. His privileges would have been taken from him,
    </p>
    <p>
     possibly the wealth he had accumulated seized, and himself reduced to
    </p>
    <p>
     slavery. Lacy, therefore, put on armour, and accompanied the king to the
    </p>
    <p>
     camp. Thus Felix, after all his aspirations, found himself serving as
    </p>
    <p>
     the knave of a mere citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had to take the horses down to water, to scour arms, to fetch wood
    </p>
    <p>
     from the forest for the fire. He was at the beck and call of all the
    </p>
    <p>
     other men, who never scrupled to use his services, and, observing that
    </p>
    <p>
     he never refused, put upon him all the more. On the other hand, when
    </p>
    <p>
     there was nothing doing, they were very kind and even thoughtful. They
    </p>
    <p>
     shared the best with him, brought wine occasionally (wine was scarce,
    </p>
    <p>
     though ale plentiful) as a delicacy, and one, who had dexterously taken
    </p>
    <p>
     a purse, presented him with half a dozen copper coins as his share of
    </p>
    <p>
     the plunder. Felix, grown wiser by experience, did not dare refuse the
    </p>
    <p>
     stolen money, it would have been considered as the greatest insult; he
    </p>
    <p>
     watched his opportunity and threw it away.
    </p>
    <p>
     The men, of course, quickly discovered his superior education, but that
    </p>
    <p>
     did not in the least surprise them, it being extremely common for
    </p>
    <p>
     unfortunate people to descend by degrees to menial offices, if once they
    </p>
    <p>
     left the estate and homestead to which they naturally belonged. There as
    </p>
    <p>
     cadets, however humble, they were certain of outward respect: once
    </p>
    <p>
     outside the influence of the head of the house, and they were worse off
    </p>
    <p>
     than the lowest retainer. His fellows would have resented any show of
    </p>
    <p>
     pride, and would speedily have made his life intolerable. As he showed
    </p>
    <p>
     none, they almost petted him, but at the same time expected him to do
    </p>
    <p>
     more than his share of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix listened with amazement to the revelations (revelations to him) of
    </p>
    <p>
     the inner life of the camp and court. The king's weaknesses, his
    </p>
    <p>
     inordinate gluttony and continual intoxication, his fits of temper, his
    </p>
    <p>
     follies and foibles, seemed as familiar to these grooms as if they had
    </p>
    <p>
     dwelt with him. As for the courtiers and barons, there was not one whose
    </p>
    <p>
     vices and secret crimes were not perfectly well known to them. Vice and
    </p>
    <p>
     crime must have their instruments; instruments are invariably
    </p>
    <p>
     indiscreet, and thus secrets escape. The palace intrigues, the intrigues
    </p>
    <p>
     with other states, the influence of certain women, there was nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     which they did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seen thus from below, the whole society appeared rotten and corrupted,
    </p>
    <p>
     coarse to the last degree, and animated only by the lowest motives. This
    </p>
    <p>
     very gossip seemed in itself criminal to Felix, but he did not at the
    </p>
    <p>
     moment reflect that it was but the tale of servants. Had such language
    </p>
    <p>
     been used by gentlemen, then it would have been treason. As himself of
    </p>
    <p>
     noble birth, Felix had hitherto seen things only from the point of view
    </p>
    <p>
     of his own class. Now he associated with grooms, he began to see society
    </p>
    <p>
     from their point of view, and recognised how feebly it was held
    </p>
    <p>
     together by brute force, intrigue, cord and axe, and woman's flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
     But a push seemed needed to overthrow it. Yet it was quite secure,
    </p>
    <p>
     nevertheless, as there was none to give that push, and if any such plot
    </p>
    <p>
     had been formed, those very slaves who suffered the most would have been
    </p>
    <p>
     the very men to give information, and to torture the plotters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix had never dreamed that common and illiterate men, such as these
    </p>
    <p>
     grooms and retainers, could have any conception of reasons of State, or
    </p>
    <p>
     the crafty designs of courts. He now found that, though they could
    </p>
    <p>
     neither writer nor read, they had learned the art of reading man (the
    </p>
    <p>
     worst and lowest side of character) to such perfection that they at once
    </p>
    <p>
     detected the motive. They read the face; the very gait and gesture gave
    </p>
    <p>
     them a clue. They read man, in fact, as an animal. They understood men
    </p>
    <p>
     just as they understood the horses and hounds under their charge. Every
    </p>
    <p>
     mood and vicious indication in those animals was known to them, and so,
    </p>
    <p>
     too, with their masters.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix thought that he was himself a hunter, and understood woodcraft; he
    </p>
    <p>
     now found how mistaken he had been. He had acquired woodcraft as a
    </p>
    <p>
     gentleman; he now learned the knave's woodcraft. They taught him a
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred tricks of which he had had no idea. They stripped man of his
    </p>
    <p>
     dignity, and nature of her refinement. Everything had a blackguard side
    </p>
    <p>
     to them. He began to understand that high principles and abstract
    </p>
    <p>
     theories were only words with the mass of men.
    </p>
    <p>
     One day he saw a knight coolly trip up a citizen (one of the king's
    </p>
    <p>
     levy) in the midst of the camp and in broad daylight, and quietly cut
    </p>
    <p>
     away his purse, at least a score of persons looking on. But they were
    </p>
    <p>
     only retainers and slaves; there was no one whose word would for a
    </p>
    <p>
     moment have been received against the knight's, who had observed this,
    </p>
    <p>
     and plundered the citizen with impunity. He flung the lesser coins to
    </p>
    <p>
     the crowd, keeping the gold and silver for himself, and walked off
    </p>
    <p>
     amidst their plaudits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix saw a slave nailed to a tree, his arms put round it so as to clasp
    </p>
    <p>
     it, and then nails driven through them. There he was left in his agony
    </p>
    <p>
     to perish. No one knew what his fault had been; his master had simply
    </p>
    <p>
     taken a dislike to him. A guard was set that no one should relieve the
    </p>
    <p>
     miserable being. Felix's horror and indignation could not have been
    </p>
    <p>
     expressed, but he was totally helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
     His own condition of mind during this time was such as could not be well
    </p>
    <p>
     analysed. He did not himself understand whether his spirit had been
    </p>
    <p>
     broken, whether he was really degraded with the men with whom he lived,
    </p>
    <p>
     or why he remained with them, though there were moments when it dawned
    </p>
    <p>
     upon him that this education, rude as it was, was not without its value
    </p>
    <p>
     to him. He need not practise these evils, but it was well to know of
    </p>
    <p>
     their existence. Thus he remained, as it were, quiescent, and the days
    </p>
    <p>
     passed on. He really had not much to do, although the rest put their
    </p>
    <p>
     burdens upon him, for discipline was so lax, that the loosest attendance
    </p>
    <p>
     answered equally well with the most conscientious. The one thing all the
    </p>
    <p>
     men about him seemed to think of was the satisfying of their appetites;
    </p>
    <p>
     the one thing they rejoiced at was the fine dry weather, for, as his
    </p>
    <p>
     mates told him, the misery of camp life in rain was almost unendurable.

    <p>
     FIGHTING
    </p>
    <p>
     Twice Felix saw the king. Once there was a review of the horse outside
    </p>
    <p>
     the camp, and Felix, having to attend with his master's third charger (a
    </p>
    <p>
     mere show and affectation, for there was not the least chance of his
    </p>
    <p>
     needing it), was now and then very near the monarch. For that day at
    </p>
    <p>
     least he looked every whit what fame had reported him to be. A man of
    </p>
    <p>
     unusual size, his bulk rendered him conspicuous in the front of the
    </p>
    <p>
     throng. His massive head seemed to accord well with the possession of
    </p>
    <p>
     despotic power.
    </p>
    <p>
     The brow was a little bare, for he was no longer young, but the back of
    </p>
    <p>
     his head was covered with thick ringlets of brown hair, so thick as to
    </p>
    <p>
     partly conceal the coronet of gold which he wore. A short purple cloak,
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely reaching to the waist, was thrown back off his shoulders, so
    </p>
    <p>
     that his steel corselet glistened in the sun. It was the only armour he
    </p>
    <p>
     had on; a long sword hung at his side. He rode a powerful black horse,
    </p>
    <p>
     full eighteen hands high, by far the finest animal on the ground; he
    </p>
    <p>
     required it, for his weight must have been great. Felix passed near
    </p>
    <p>
     enough to note that his eyes were brown, and the expression of his face
    </p>
    <p>
     open, frank, and pleasing. The impression left upon the observer was
    </p>
    <p>
     that of a strong intellect, but a still stronger physique, which latter
    </p>
    <p>
     too often ran away with and controlled the former. No one could look
    </p>
    <p>
     upon him without admiration, and it was difficult to think that he could
    </p>
    <p>
     so demean himself as to wallow in the grossest indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
     As for the review, though it was a brilliant scene, Felix could not
    </p>
    <p>
     conceal from himself that these gallant knights were extremely irregular
    </p>
    <p>
     in their movements, and not one single evolution was performed
    </p>
    <p>
     correctly, because they were constantly quarrelling about precedence,
    </p>
    <p>
     and one would not consent to follow the other. He soon understood,
    </p>
    <p>
     however, that discipline was not the object, nor regularity considered;
    </p>
    <p>
     personal courage and personal dexterity were everything. This review was
    </p>
    <p>
     the prelude to active operations, and Felix now hoped to have some
    </p>
    <p>
     practical lessons in warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was mistaken. Instead of a grand assault, or a regular approach, the
    </p>
    <p>
     fighting was merely a series of combats between small detachments and
    </p>
    <p>
     bodies of the enemy. Two or three knights with their retainers and
    </p>
    <p>
     slaves would start forth, cross the stream, and riding right past the
    </p>
    <p>
     besieged city endeavour to sack some small hamlet, or the homestead of a
    </p>
    <p>
     noble. From the city a sortie would ensue; sometimes the two bodies only
    </p>
    <p>
     threatened each other at a distance, the first retiring as the second
    </p>
    <p>
     advanced. Sometimes only a few arrows were discharged; occasionally they
    </p>
    <p>
     came to blows, but the casualties were rarely heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
     One such party, while returning, was followed by a squadron of horsemen
    </p>
    <p>
     from the town towards the stream to within three hundred yards of the
    </p>
    <p>
     king's quarters. Incensed at this assurance, several knights mounted
    </p>
    <p>
     their horses and rode out to reinforce the returning detachment, which
    </p>
    <p>
     was loaded with booty. Finding themselves about to be supported, they
    </p>
    <p>
     threw down their spoils, faced about, and Felix saw for the first time a
    </p>
    <p>
     real and desperate melée. It was over in five minutes. The king's
    </p>
    <p>
     knights, far better horsed, and filled with desire to exhibit their
    </p>
    <p>
     valour to the camp, charged with such fury that they overthrew the enemy
    </p>
    <p>
     and rode over him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix saw the troops meet; there was a crash and cracking as the lances
    </p>
    <p>
     broke, four or five rolled from the saddle on the trodden corn, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     next moment the entangled mass of men and horses unwound itself as the
    </p>
    <p>
     enemy hastened back to the walls. Felix was eager to join in such an
    </p>
    <p>
     affray, but he had no horse nor weapon. Upon another occasion early one
    </p>
    <p>
     bright morning four knights and their followers, about forty in all,
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberately set out from the camp, and advanced up the sloping ground
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the city. The camp was soon astir watching their proceedings;
    </p>
    <p>
     and the king, being made acquainted with what was going on, came out
    </p>
    <p>
     from his booth. Felix, who now entered the circular entrenchment without
    </p>
    <p>
     any difficulty, got up on the mound with scores of others, where,
    </p>
    <p>
     holding to the stakes, they had a good view.
    </p>
    <p>
     The king stood on a bench and watched the troops advance, shading his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes with his hand. As it was but half a mile to the walls they could
    </p>
    <p>
     see all that took place. When the knights had got within two hundred
    </p>
    <p>
     yards and arrows began to drop amongst them, they dismounted from their
    </p>
    <p>
     horses and left them in charge of the grooms, who walked them up and
    </p>
    <p>
     down, none remaining still a minute, so as to escape the aim of the
    </p>
    <p>
     enemy's archers. Then drawing their swords, the knights, who were in
    </p>
    <p>
     full armour, put themselves at the head of the band, and advanced at a
    </p>
    <p>
     steady pace to the wall. In their mail with their shields before them
    </p>
    <p>
     they cared not for such feeble archery, nor even for the darts that
    </p>
    <p>
     poured upon them when they came within reach. There was no fosse to the
    </p>
    <p>
     wall, so that, pushing forward, they were soon at the foot. So easily
    </p>
    <p>
     had they reached it that Felix almost thought the city already won. Now
    </p>
    <p>
     he saw blocks of stone, darts, and beams of wood cast at them from the
    </p>
    <p>
     parapet, which was not more than twelve feet above the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quite undismayed, the knights set up their ladders, of which they had
    </p>
    <p>
     but four, one each. The men-at-arms held these by main force against the
    </p>
    <p>
     wall, the besiegers trying to throw them away, and chopping at the rungs
    </p>
    <p>
     with their axes. But the ladders were well shod with iron to resist such
    </p>
    <p>
     blows, and in a moment Felix saw, with intense delight and admiration,
    </p>
    <p>
     the four knights slowly mount to the parapet and cut at the defenders
    </p>
    <p>
     with their swords. The gleam of steel was distinctly visible as the
    </p>
    <p>
     blades rose and fell. The enemy thrust at them with pikes, but seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     shrink from closer combat, and a moment afterwards the gallant four
    </p>
    <p>
     stood on the top of the wall. Their figures, clad in mail and shield in
    </p>
    <p>
     hand, were distinctly seen against the sky. Up swarmed the men-at-arms
    </p>
    <p>
     behind them, and some seemed to descend on the other side. A shout rose
    </p>
    <p>
     from the camp and echoed over the woods. Felix shouted with the rest,
    </p>
    <p>
     wild with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next minute, while yet the knights stood on the wall, and scarcely
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to know what to do next, there appeared at least a dozen men in
    </p>
    <p>
     armour running along the wall towards them. Felix afterwards understood
    </p>
    <p>
     that the ease with which the four won the wall at first was owing to
    </p>
    <p>
     there being no men of knightly rank among the defenders at that early
    </p>
    <p>
     hour. Those who had collected to repulse the assault were citizens,
    </p>
    <p>
     retainers, slaves, any, in fact who had been near. But now the news had
    </p>
    <p>
     reached the enemy's leaders, and some of them hastened to the wall. As
    </p>
    <p>
     these were seen approaching, the camp was hushed, and every eye strained
    </p>
    <p>
     on the combatants.
    </p>
    <p>
     The noble four could not all meet their assailants, the wall was but
    </p>
    <p>
     wide enough for two to fight; but the other two had work enough the next
    </p>
    <p>
     minute, as eight or ten more men in mail advanced the other way. So they
    </p>
    <p>
     fought back to back, two facing one way, and two the other. The swords
    </p>
    <p>
     rose and fell. Felix saw a flash of light fly up into the air, it was
    </p>
    <p>
     the point of a sword broken off short. At the foot of the wall the men
    </p>
    <p>
     who had not had time to mount endeavoured to assist their masters by
    </p>
    <p>
     stabbing upwards with their spears.
    </p>
    <p>
     All at once two of the knights were hurled from the wall; one seemed to
    </p>
    <p>
     be caught by his men, the other came heavily to the ground. While they
    </p>
    <p>
     were fighting their immediate antagonists, others within the wall had
    </p>
    <p>
     come with lances; and literally thrust them from the parapet. The other
    </p>
    <p>
     two still fought back to back for a moment; then, finding themselves
    </p>
    <p>
     overwhelmed, they sprang down among their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     The minute the two first fell, the grooms with the horses ran towards
    </p>
    <p>
     the wall, and despite the rain of arrows, darts, and stones from the
    </p>
    <p>
     parapet, Felix saw with relief three of the four knights placed on their
    </p>
    <p>
     chargers. One only could sit upright unassisted, two were supported in
    </p>
    <p>
     their saddles, and the fourth was carried by his retainers. Thus they
    </p>
    <p>
     retreated, and apparently without further hurt, for the enemy on the
    </p>
    <p>
     wall crowded so much together as to interfere with the aim of their
    </p>
    <p>
     darts, which, too, soon fell short. But there was a dark heap beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     the wall, where ten or twelve retainers and slaves, who wore no armour,
    </p>
    <p>
     had been slain or disabled. Upon these the loss invariably fell.
    </p>
    <p>
     None attempted to follow the retreating party, who slowly returned
    </p>
    <p>
     towards the camp, and were soon apparently in safety. But suddenly a
    </p>
    <p>
     fresh party of the enemy appeared upon the wall, and the instant
    </p>
    <p>
     afterwards three retainers dropped, as if struck by lightning. They had
    </p>
    <p>
     been hit by sling stones, whirled with great force by practised
    </p>
    <p>
     slingers. These rounded pebbles come with such impetus as to stun a man
    </p>
    <p>
     at two hundred yards. The aim, it is true, is uncertain, but where there
    </p>
    <p>
     is a body of troops they are sure to strike some one. Hastening on,
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving the three fallen men where they lay, the rest in two minutes
    </p>
    <p>
     were out of range, and came safely into camp. Everyone, as they crossed
    </p>
    <p>
     the stream, ran to meet them, the king included, and as he passed in the
    </p>
    <p>
     throng, Felix heard him remark that they had had a capital main of cocks
    </p>
    <p>
     that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of the knights only one was much injured; he had fallen upon a stone,
    </p>
    <p>
     and two ribs were broken; the rest suffered from severe bruises, but had
    </p>
    <p>
     no wound. Six men-at-arms were missing, probably prisoners, for, as
    </p>
    <p>
     courageous as their masters, they had leapt down from the wall into the
    </p>
    <p>
     town. Eleven other retainers or slaves were slain, or had deserted, or
    </p>
    <p>
     were prisoners, and no trouble was taken about them. As for the three
    </p>
    <p>
     who were knocked over by the sling stones, there they lay until they
    </p>
    <p>
     recovered their senses, when they crawled into camp. This incident
    </p>
    <p>
     cooled Felix's ardour for the fray, for he reflected that, if injured
    </p>
    <p>
     thus, he too, as a mere groom, would be left. The devotion of the
    </p>
    <p>
     retainers to save and succour their masters was almost heroic. The
    </p>
    <p>
     mailed knights thought no more of their men, unless it was some
    </p>
    <p>
     particular favourite, than of a hound slashed by a boar's tusk in the
    </p>
    <p>
     chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the first flush of his excitement had passed, Felix, thinking over
    </p>
    <p>
     the scene of the morning as he took his horses down to water at the
    </p>
    <p>
     stream, became filled at first with contempt, and then with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
     That the first commander of the age should thus look on while the wall
    </p>
    <p>
     was won before his eyes, and yet never send a strong detachment, or move
    </p>
    <p>
     himself with his whole army to follow up the advantage, seemed past
    </p>
    <p>
     understanding. If he did not intend to follow it up, why permit such
    </p>
    <p>
     desperate ventures, which must be overwhelmed by mere numbers, and could
    </p>
    <p>
     result only in the loss of brave men? And if he did permit it, why did
    </p>
    <p>
     he not, when he saw they were overthrown, send a squadron to cover their
    </p>
    <p>
     retreat? To call such an exhibition of courage "a main of cocks", to
    </p>
    <p>
     look on it as a mere display for his amusement, was barbarous and cruel
    </p>
    <p>
     in the extreme. He worked himself up into a state of anger which
    </p>
    <p>
     rendered him less cautious than usual in expressing his opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The king was not nearly so much at fault as Felix, arguing on abstract
    </p>
    <p>
     principles, imagined. He had long experience of war, and he knew its
    </p>
    <p>
     extreme uncertainty. The issue of the greatest battle often hung on the
    </p>
    <p>
     conduct of a single leader, or even a single man-at-arms. He had seen
    </p>
    <p>
     walls won and lost before. To follow up such a venture with a strong
    </p>
    <p>
     detachment must result in one of two things, either the detachment in
    </p>
    <p>
     its turn must be supported by the entire army, or it must eventually
    </p>
    <p>
     retreat. If it retreated, the loss of prestige would be serious, and
    </p>
    <p>
     might encourage the enemy to attack the camp, for it was only his
    </p>
    <p>
     prestige which prevented them. If supported by the entire army, then the
    </p>
    <p>
     fate of the whole expedition depended upon that single day.
    </p>
    <p>
     The enemy had the advantage of the wall, of the narrow streets and
    </p>
    <p>
     enclosures within, of the houses, each of which would become a fortress,
    </p>
    <p>
     and thus in the winding streets a repulse might easily happen. To risk
    </p>
    <p>
     such an event would be folly in the last degree, before the town had
    </p>
    <p>
     been dispirited and discouraged by the continuance of the siege, the
    </p>
    <p>
     failure of their provisions, or the fall of their chief leaders in the
    </p>
    <p>
     daily combats that took place.
    </p>
    <p>
     The army had no discipline whatever, beyond that of the attachment of
    </p>
    <p>
     the retainer to his lord, and the dread of punishment on the part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     slave. There were no distinct ranks, no organized corps. The knights
    </p>
    <p>
     followed the greater barons, the retainers the knights; the greater
    </p>
    <p>
     barons followed the king. Such an army could not be risked in an assault
    </p>
    <p>
     of this kind. The venture was not ordered, nor was it discouraged; to
    </p>
    <p>
     discourage, indeed, all attempts would have been bad policy; it was upon
    </p>
    <p>
     the courage and bravery of his knights that the king depended, and upon
    </p>
    <p>
     that alone rested his hopes of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
     The great baron whose standard they followed would have sent them
    </p>
    <p>
     assistance if he had deemed it necessary. The king, unless on the day of
    </p>
    <p>
     battle, would not trouble about such a detail. As for the remark, that
    </p>
    <p>
     they had had "a good main of cocks that morning," he simply expressed
    </p>
    <p>
     the feeling of the whole camp. The spectacle Felix had seen was, in
    </p>
    <p>
     fact, merely an instance of the strength and of the weakness of the army
    </p>
    <p>
     and the monarch himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix afterwards acknowledged these things to himself, but at the
    </p>
    <p>
     moment, full of admiration for the bravery of the four knights and their
    </p>
    <p>
     followers, he was full of indignation, and uttered his views too freely.
    </p>
    <p>
     His fellow-grooms cautioned him; but his spirit was up, and he gave way
    </p>
    <p>
     to his feelings without restraint. Now, to laugh at the king's
    </p>
    <p>
     weaknesses, his gluttony or follies, was one thing; to criticise his
    </p>
    <p>
     military conduct was another. The one was merely badinage, and the king
    </p>
    <p>
     himself might have laughed had he heard it; the other was treason, and,
    </p>
    <p>
     moreover, likely to touch the monarch on the delicate matter of military
    </p>
    <p>
     reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of this Felix quickly became aware. His mates, indeed, tried to shield
    </p>
    <p>
     him; but possibly the citizen, his master, had enemies in the camp,
    </p>
    <p>
     barons, perhaps, to whom he had lent money, and who watched for a chance
    </p>
    <p>
     of securing his downfall. At all events, early the next day Felix was
    </p>
    <p>
     rudely arrested by the provost in person, bound with cords, and placed
    </p>
    <p>
     in the provost's booth. At the same time, his master was ordered to
    </p>
    <p>
     remain within, and a guard was put over him.

     CHAPTER XX
    </head>
    <p>
     IN DANGER
    </p>
    <p>
     Hope died within Felix when he thus suddenly found himself so near the
    </p>
    <p>
     executioner. He had known so many butchered without cause, that he had,
    </p>
    <p>
     indeed, reason to despair. Towards the sunset he felt sure he should be
    </p>
    <p>
     dragged forth and hanged on the oak used for the purpose, and which
    </p>
    <p>
     stood near where the track from Aisi joined the camp. Such would most
    </p>
    <p>
     probably have been his fate, had he been alone concerned in this affair,
    </p>
    <p>
     but by good fortune he was able to escape so miserable an end. Still, he
    </p>
    <p>
     suffered as much as if the rope had finished him, for he had no means of
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing what would be the result.
    </p>
    <p>
     His heart swelled with bitterness; he was filled with inexpressible
    </p>
    <p>
     indignation, his whole being rebelled against the blundering, as it
    </p>
    <p>
     were, of events which had thus thrown him into the jaws of death. In an
    </p>
    <p>
     hour or two, however, he sufficiently recovered from the shock to
    </p>
    <p>
     reflect that most probably they would give him some chance to speak for
    </p>
    <p>
     himself. There would not be any trial; who would waste time in trying so
    </p>
    <p>
     insignificant a wretch? But there might be some opportunity of speaking,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he resolved to use it to the utmost possible extent.
    </p>
    <p>
     He would arraign the unskilful generalship of the king; he would not
    </p>
    <p>
     only point out his errors, but how the enemy could be defeated. He would
    </p>
    <p>
     prove that he had ideas and plans worthy of attention. He would, as it
    </p>
    <p>
     were, vindicate himself before he was executed, and he tried to collect
    </p>
    <p>
     his thoughts and to put them into form. Every moment the face of Aurora
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to look upon him, lovingly and mournfully; but beside it he saw
    </p>
    <p>
     the dusty and distorted features of the copse he had seen drawn by the
    </p>
    <p>
     horse through the camp. Thus, too, his tongue would protrude and lick
    </p>
    <p>
     the dust. He endured, in a word, those treble agonies which the
    </p>
    <p>
     highly-wrought and imaginative inflict upon themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hours passed, and still no one came near him; he called, and the
    </p>
    <p>
     guard appeared at the door, but only to see what was the matter, and
    </p>
    <p>
     finding his prisoner safe, at once resumed his walk to and fro. The
    </p>
    <p>
     soldier did not, for his own sake, dare to enter into conversation with
    </p>
    <p>
     a prisoner under arrest for such an offence; he might be involved, or
    </p>
    <p>
     suspected. Had it been merely theft or any ordinary crime, he would have
    </p>
    <p>
     talked freely enough, and sympathized with the prisoner. As time went
    </p>
    <p>
     on, Felix grew thirsty, but his request for water was disregarded, and
    </p>
    <p>
     there he remained till four in the afternoon. They then marched him out;
    </p>
    <p>
     he begged to be allowed to speak, but the soldiery did not reply, simply
    </p>
    <p>
     hurrying him forward. He now feared that he should be executed without
    </p>
    <p>
     the chance being afforded him to say a word; but, to his surprise, he
    </p>
    <p>
     found in a few minutes that they were taking him in the direction of the
    </p>
    <p>
     king's quarters. New fears now seized him, for he had heard of men being
    </p>
    <p>
     turned loose, made to run for their lives, and hunted down with hounds
    </p>
    <p>
     for the amusement of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the citizen's wealth had made him many enemies (men whom he had
    </p>
    <p>
     befriended, and who hoped, if they could be see him executed, to escape
    </p>
    <p>
     the payment of their debts), on the other hand, it had made him as many
    </p>
    <p>
     friends, that is, interested friends, who trusted by doing him service
    </p>
    <p>
     to obtain advances. These latter had lost no time, for greed is quite as
    </p>
    <p>
     eager as hate, and carried the matter at once to the king. What they
    </p>
    <p>
     desired was that the case should be decided by the monarch himself, and
    </p>
    <p>
     not by his chancellor, or a judge appointed for the purpose. The judge
    </p>
    <p>
     would be nearly certain to condemn the citizen, and to confiscate
    </p>
    <p>
     whatever he could lay hands on. The king might pardon, and would be
    </p>
    <p>
     content with a part only, where his ministers would grasp all.
    </p>
    <p>
     These friends succeeded in their object; the king, who hated all
    </p>
    <p>
     judicial affairs because they involved the trouble of investigation,
    </p>
    <p>
     shrugged his shoulders at the request, and would not have granted it had
    </p>
    <p>
     it not come out that the citizen's servant had declared him to be an
    </p>
    <p>
     incapable commander. At this the king started. "We are, indeed, fallen
    </p>
    <p>
     low," said he, "when a miserable trader's knave calls us incapable. We
    </p>
    <p>
     will see this impudent rascal." He accordingly ordered that the prisoner
    </p>
    <p>
     should be brought before him after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix was led inside the entrenchment, unbound, and commanded to stand
    </p>
    <p>
     upright. There was a considerable assembly of the greater barons anxious
    </p>
    <p>
     to see the trial of the money-lender, who, though present, was kept
    </p>
    <p>
     apart from Felix lest the two should arrange their defence. The king was
    </p>
    <p>
     sleeping on a couch outside the booth in the shade; he was lying on his
    </p>
    <p>
     back breathing loudly with open mouth. How different his appearance to
    </p>
    <p>
     the time when he sat on his splendid charger and reviewed his knights! A
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy meal had been succeeded by as heavy a slumber. No one dared to
    </p>
    <p>
     disturb him; the assembly moved on tiptoe and conversed in whispers. The
    </p>
    <p>
     experienced divined that the prisoners were certain to be condemned, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the king would wake with indigestion, and vent his uneasy sensations
    </p>
    <p>
     upon them. Full an hour elapsed before the king awoke with a snort and
    </p>
    <p>
     called for a draught of water. How Felix envied that draught! He had
    </p>
    <p>
     neither eaten nor drunk since the night previous; it was a hot day, and
    </p>
    <p>
     his tongue was dry and parched.
    </p>
    <p>
     The citizen was first accused; he denied any treasonable designs or
    </p>
    <p>
     expressions whatever; as for the other prisoner, till the time he was
    </p>
    <p>
     arrested he did not even know he had been in his service. He was some
    </p>
    <p>
     stroller whom his grooms had incautiously engaged, the lazy scoundrels,
    </p>
    <p>
     to assist them. He had never even spoken to him; it the knave told the
    </p>
    <p>
     truth he must acknowledge this.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How now," said the king, turning to Felix; "what do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It is true," replied Felix, "he has never spoken to me nor I to him. He
    </p>
    <p>
     knew nothing of what I said. I said it on my own account, and I say it
    </p>
    <p>
     again!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "And pray, sir knave," said the king, sitting up on his couch, for he
    </p>
    <p>
     was surprised to hear one so meanly dressed speak so correctly, and so
    </p>
    <p>
     boldly face him. "What was it you did say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "If your majesty will order me a single drop of water," said the
    </p>
    <p>
     prisoner, "I will repeat it word for word, but I have had nothing the
    </p>
    <p>
     whole day, and I can hardly move my tongue."
    </p>
    <p>
     Without a word the king handed him the cup from which he had himself
    </p>
    <p>
     drunk. Never, surely, was water so delicious. Felix drained it to the
    </p>
    <p>
     bottom, handed it back (an officer took it), and with one brief thought
    </p>
    <p>
     of Aurora, he said: "Your majesty, you are an incapable commander."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go on," said the king sarcastically; "why am I incapable?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You have attacked the wrong city; these three are all your enemies, and
    </p>
    <p>
     you have attacked the first. They stand in a row."
    </p>
    <p>
     "They stand in a row," repeated the king; "and we will knock them over
    </p>
    <p>
     like three nine-pins."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But you have begun with the end one," said Felix, "and that is the
    </p>
    <p>
     mistake. For after you have taken the first you must take the second,
    </p>
    <p>
     and still after that the third. But you might have saved much trouble
    </p>
    <p>
     and time if----"
    </p>
    <p>
     "If what?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you had assaulted the middle one first. For then, while the siege
    </p>
    <p>
     went on, you would have been able to prevent either of the other two
    </p>
    <p>
     towns from sending assistance, and when you had taken the first and put
    </p>
    <p>
     your garrison in it, neither of the others could have stirred, or reaped
    </p>
    <p>
     their corn, nor could they even communicate with each other, since you
    </p>
    <p>
     would be between them; and in fact you would have cut your enemies in
    </p>
    <p>
     twain."
    </p>
    <p>
     "By St. John!" swore the king, "it is a good idea. I begin to think--but
    </p>
    <p>
     go on, you have more to say."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think, too, your majesty, that by staying here as you have done this
    </p>
    <p>
     fortnight past without action, you have encouraged the other two cities
    </p>
    <p>
     to make more desperate resistance; and it seems to me that you are in a
    </p>
    <p>
     dangerous position, and may at any moment be overwhelmed with disaster,
    </p>
    <p>
     for there is nothing whatever to prevent either of the other two from
    </p>
    <p>
     sending troops to burn the open city of Aisi in your absence. And that
    </p>
    <p>
     danger must increase every day as they take courage by your idleness."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Idleness! There shall be idleness no longer. The man speaks the truth;
    </p>
    <p>
     we will consider further of this, we will move on Adelinton," turning to
    </p>
    <p>
     his barons.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If it please your majesty," said Baron Ingulph, "this man invented a
    </p>
    <p>
     new trigger for our carriage crossbows, but he was lost in the crowd,
    </p>
    <p>
     and we have sought for him in vain; my serjeant here has this moment
    </p>
    <p>
     recognised him."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why did you not come to us before, fellow?" said the king. "Let him be
    </p>
    <p>
     released; let him be entertained at our expense; give him clothes and a
    </p>
    <p>
     sword. We will see you further."
    </p>
    <p>
     Overjoyed at this sudden turn of fortune, Felix forgot to let well
    </p>
    <p>
     alone. He had his audience with him for a moment; he could not resist as
    </p>
    <p>
     it were following up his victory. He thanked the king, and added that he
    </p>
    <p>
     could make a machine which would knock the walls yonder to pieces
    </p>
    <p>
     without it being necessary to approach nearer than half a bow-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is this?" said the king. "Ingulph, have you ever heard of such a
    </p>
    <p>
     machine?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "There is no such thing," said the Baron, beginning to feel that his
    </p>
    <p>
     professional reputation as the master of the artillery was assailed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There is nothing of the kind known."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It will shoot stones as big, as heavy as a man can lift," said Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     eagerly, "and easily knock towers to fragments."
    </p>
    <p>
     The king looked from one to another; he was incredulous. The Baron
    </p>
    <p>
     smiled scornfully. "Ask him, your majesty, how these stones are to be
    </p>
    <p>
     thrown; no bow could do it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "How are the stones to be thrown?" said the king sharply. "Beware how
    </p>
    <p>
     you play with us."
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the force of twisted ropes, your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
     They all laughed. The Baron said: "You see, your majesty, there is
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing of the kind. This is some jester."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The twisted rope should be a halter," said another courtier, one of
    </p>
    <p>
     those who hoped for the rich man's downfall.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It can be done, your majesty," cried Felix, alarmed. "I assure you, a
    </p>
    <p>
     stone of two hundredweight might be thrown a quarter of a mile."
    </p>
    <p>
     The assembly did not repress its contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The man is a fool," said the king, who now thought that Felix was a
    </p>
    <p>
     jester who had put a trick upon him. "But your joke is out of joint; I
    </p>
    <p>
     will teach such fellows to try tricks on us! Beat him out of camp."
    </p>
    <p>
     The provost's men seized him, and in a moment he was dragged off his
    </p>
    <p>
     feet, and bodily carried outside the entrenchment. Thence they pushed
    </p>
    <p>
     him along, beating him with the butts of their spears to make him run
    </p>
    <p>
     the faster; the groups they passed laughed and jeered; the dogs barked
    </p>
    <p>
     and snapped at his ankles. They hurried him outside the camp, and
    </p>
    <p>
     thrusting him savagely with their spear butts sent him headlong. There
    </p>
    <p>
     they left him, with the caution which he did not hear, being insensible,
    </p>
    <p>
     that if he ventured inside the lines he would be at once hanged. Like a
    </p>
    <p>
     dead dog they left him on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some hours later, in the dusk of the evening, Felix stole from the spot,
    </p>
    <p>
     skirting the forest like a wild animal afraid to venture from its cover,
    </p>
    <p>
     till he reached the track which led to Aisi. His one idea was to reach
    </p>
    <p>
     his canoe. He would have gone through the woods, but that was not
    </p>
    <p>
     possible. Without axe or wood-knife to hew a way, the tangled brushwood
    </p>
    <p>
     he knew to be impassable, having observed how thick it was when coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aching and trembling in every limb, not so much with physical suffering
    </p>
    <p>
     as that kind of inward fever which follows unmerited injury, the revolt
    </p>
    <p>
     of the mind against it, he followed the track as fast as his weary frame
    </p>
    <p>
     would let him. He had tasted nothing that day but the draught from the
    </p>
    <p>
     king's cup, and a second draught when he recovered consciousness, from
    </p>
    <p>
     the stream that flowed past the camp. Yet he walked steadily on without
    </p>
    <p>
     pause; his head hung forward, and his arms were listless, but his feet
    </p>
    <p>
     mechanically plodded on. He walked, indeed, by his will, and not with
    </p>
    <p>
     his sinews. Thus, like a ghost, for there was no life in him, he
    </p>
    <p>
     traversed the shadowy forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dawn came, and still he kept onwards. As the sun rose higher, having
    </p>
    <p>
     now travelled fully twenty miles, he saw houses on the right of the
    </p>
    <p>
     trail. They were evidently those of retainers or workmen employed on the
    </p>
    <p>
     manor, for a castle stood at some distance.
    </p>
    <p>
     An hour later he approached the second or open city of Aisi, where the
    </p>
    <p>
     ferry was across the channel. In his present condition he could not pass
    </p>
    <p>
     through the town. No one there knew of his disgrace, but it was the same
    </p>
    <p>
     to him as if they had. Avoiding the town itself, he crossed the
    </p>
    <p>
     cultivated fields, and upon arriving at the channel he at once stepped
    </p>
    <p>
     in, and swam across to the opposite shore. It was not more than sixty
    </p>
    <p>
     yards, but, weary as he was, it was an exhausting effort. He sat down,
    </p>
    <p>
     but immediately got up and struggled on.
    </p>
    <p>
     The church tower on the slope of the hill was a landmark by which he
    </p>
    <p>
     easily discovered the direction of the spot where he had hidden the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe. But he felt unable to push through the belt of brushwood, reeds,
    </p>
    <p>
     and flags beside the shore, and therefore struck through the firs,
    </p>
    <p>
     following a cattle track, which doubtless led to another grazing ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     This ran parallel with the shore, and when he judged himself about level
    </p>
    <p>
     with the canoe he left it, and entered the wood itself. For a little way
    </p>
    <p>
     he could walk, but the thick fir branches soon blocked his progress, and
    </p>
    <p>
     he could progress only on hands and knees, creeping beneath them. There
    </p>
    <p>
     was a hollow space under the lower branches free from brushwood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus he painfully approached the Lake, and descending the hill, after an
    </p>
    <p>
     hour's weary work emerged among the rushes and reeds. He was within two
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred yards of the canoe, for he recognised the island opposite it. In
    </p>
    <p>
     ten minutes he found it undisturbed and exactly as he had left it,
    </p>
    <p>
     except that the breeze had strewn the dry reeds with which it was
    </p>
    <p>
     covered with willow leaves, yellow and dead (they fall while all the
    </p>
    <p>
     rest are green), which had been whirled from the branches. Throwing
    </p>
    <p>
     himself upon the reeds beside the canoe, he dropped asleep as if he had
    </p>
    <p>
     been dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     He awoke as the sun was sinking and sat up, hungry in the extreme, but
    </p>
    <p>
     much refreshed. There were still some stores in the canoe, of which he
    </p>
    <p>
     ate ravenously. But he felt better now; he felt at home beside his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
     He could hardly believe in the reality of the hideous dream through
    </p>
    <p>
     which he had passed. But when he tried to stand, his feet, cut and
    </p>
    <p>
     blistered, only too painfully assured him of its reality. He took out
    </p>
    <p>
     his hunter's hide and cloak and spread himself a comfortable bed. Though
    </p>
    <p>
     he had slept so long he was still weary. He reclined in a
    </p>
    <p>
     semi-unconscious state, his frame slowly recovering from the strain it
    </p>
    <p>
     had endured, till by degrees he fell asleep again. Sleep, nothing but
    </p>
    <p>
     sleep, restores the overtaxed mind and body.

    <p>
     A VOYAGE
    </p>
    <p>
     The sun was up when Felix awoke, and as he raised himself the beauty of
    </p>
    <p>
     the Lake before him filled him with pleasure. By the shore it was so
    </p>
    <p>
     calm that the trees were perfectly reflected, and the few willow leaves
    </p>
    <p>
     that had fallen floated without drifting one way or the other. Farther
    </p>
    <p>
     out the islands were lit up with the sunlight, and the swallows skimmed
    </p>
    <p>
     the water, following the outline of their shores. In the Lake beyond
    </p>
    <p>
     them, glimpses of which he could see through the channel or passage
    </p>
    <p>
     between, there was a ripple where the faint south-western breeze touched
    </p>
    <p>
     the surface. His mind went out to the beauty of it. He did not question
    </p>
    <p>
     or analyse his feelings; he launched his vessel, and left that hard and
    </p>
    <p>
     tyrannical land for the loveliness of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Paddling out to the islands he passed through between them, and reached
    </p>
    <p>
     the open Lake. There he hoisted the sail, the gentle breeze filled it,
    </p>
    <p>
     the sharp cutwater began to divide the ripples, a bubbling sound arose,
    </p>
    <p>
     and steering due north, straight out to the open and boundless expanse,
    </p>
    <p>
     he was carried swiftly away.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mallards, who saw the canoe coming, at first scarcely moved, never
    </p>
    <p>
     thinking that a boat would venture outside the islands, within whose
    </p>
    <p>
     line they were accustomed to see vessels, but when the canoe continued
    </p>
    <p>
     to bear down upon them, they flew up and descended far away to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
     When he had sailed past the spot where these birds had floated, the Lake
    </p>
    <p>
     was his own. By the shores of the islands the crows came down for
    </p>
    <p>
     mussels. Moorhens swam in and out among the rushes, water-rats nibbled
    </p>
    <p>
     at the flags, pikes basked at the edge of the weeds, summer-snipes ran
    </p>
    <p>
     along the sand, and doubtless an otter here and there was in
    </p>
    <p>
     concealment. Without the line of the shoals and islets, now that the
    </p>
    <p>
     mallards had flown, there was a solitude of water. It was far too deep
    </p>
    <p>
     for the longest weeds, nothing seemed to exist here. The very
    </p>
    <p>
     water-snails seek the shore, or are drifted by the currents into shallow
    </p>
    <p>
     corners. Neither great nor little care for the broad expanse.
    </p>
    <p>
     The canoe moved more rapidly as the wind came now with its full force
    </p>
    <p>
     over the distant woods and hills, and though it was but a light
    </p>
    <p>
     southerly breeze, the broad sail impelled the taper vessel swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reclining in the stern, Felix lost all consciousness of aught but that
    </p>
    <p>
     he was pleasantly borne along. His eyes were not closed, and he was
    </p>
    <p>
     aware of the canoe, the Lake, the sunshine, and the sky, and yet he was
    </p>
    <p>
     asleep. Physically awake, he mentally slumbered. It was rest. After the
    </p>
    <p>
     misery, exertion, and excitement of the last fortnight it was rest,
    </p>
    <p>
     intense rest for body and mind. The pressure of the water against the
    </p>
    <p>
     handle of the rudder-paddle, the slight vibration of the wood, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     bubbles rushed by beneath, alone perhaps kept him from really falling
    </p>
    <p>
     asleep. This was something which could not be left to itself; it must be
    </p>
    <p>
     firmly grasped, and that effort restrained his drowsiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three hours passed. The shore was twelve or fifteen miles behind, and
    </p>
    <p>
     looked like a blue cloud, for the summer haze hid the hills, more than
    </p>
    <p>
     would have been the case in clearer weather.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another hour, and at last Felix, awakening from his slumberous
    </p>
    <p>
     condition, looked round and saw nothing but the waves. The shore he had
    </p>
    <p>
     left had entirely disappeared, gone down; if there were land more lofty
    </p>
    <p>
     on either hand, the haze concealed it. He looked again; he could
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely comprehend it. He knew the Lake was very wide, but it had never
    </p>
    <p>
     occurred to him that he might possibly sail out of sight of land. This,
    </p>
    <p>
     then was why the mariners would not quit the islands; they feared the
    </p>
    <p>
     open water. He stood up and swept the horizon carefully, shading his
    </p>
    <p>
     eyes with his hand; there was nothing but a mist at the horizon. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     alone with the sun, the sky, and the Lake. He could not surely have
    </p>
    <p>
     sailed into the ocean without knowing it? He sat down, dipped his hand
    </p>
    <p>
     overboard and tasted the drops that adhered; the water was pure and
    </p>
    <p>
     sweet, warm from the summer sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was not so much as a swift in the upper sky; nothing but slender
    </p>
    <p>
     filaments of white cloud. No swallows glided over the surface of the
    </p>
    <p>
     water. If there were fishes he could not see them through the waves,
    </p>
    <p>
     which were here much larger; sufficiently large, though the wind was
    </p>
    <p>
     light, to make his canoe rise and fall with their regular rolling. To
    </p>
    <p>
     see fishes a calm surface is necessary, and, like other creatures, they
    </p>
    <p>
     haunt the shallows and the shore. Never had he felt alone like this in
    </p>
    <p>
     the depths of the farthest forest he had penetrated. Had he contemplated
    </p>
    <p>
     beforehand the possibility of passing out of sight of land, when he
    </p>
    <p>
     found that the canoe had arrived he would probably have been alarmed and
    </p>
    <p>
     anxious for his safety. But thus stumbling drowsily into the solitude of
    </p>
    <p>
     the vast Lake, he was so astounded with his own discovery, so absorbed
    </p>
    <p>
     in thinking of the immense expanse, that the idea of danger did not
    </p>
    <p>
     occur to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another hour passed, and he now began to gaze about him more eagerly for
    </p>
    <p>
     some sight of land, for he had very little provision with him, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     did not wish to spend the night upon the Lake. Presently, however, the
    </p>
    <p>
     mist on the horizon ahead appeared to thicken, and then became blue, and
    </p>
    <p>
     in a shorter time than he expected land came in sight. This arose from
    </p>
    <p>
     the fact of its being low, so that he had approached nearer than he knew
    </p>
    <p>
     before recognising it. At the time when he was really out of sight of
    </p>
    <p>
     the coast, he was much further from the hilly land left behind than from
    </p>
    <p>
     the low country in front, and not in the mathematical centre, as he had
    </p>
    <p>
     supposed, of the Lake. As it rose and came more into sight, he already
    </p>
    <p>
     began to wonder what reception he should meet with from the inhabitants,
    </p>
    <p>
     and whether he should find them as hard of heart as the people he had
    </p>
    <p>
     just escaped from. Should he, indeed, venture among them at all? Or
    </p>
    <p>
     should he remain in the woods till he had observed more of their ways
    </p>
    <p>
     and manners? These questions were being debated in his mind, when he
    </p>
    <p>
     perceived that the wind was falling.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the sun went past the meridian the breeze fell, till, in the hottest
    </p>
    <p>
     part of the afternoon, and when he judged that he was not more than
    </p>
    <p>
     eight miles from shore, it sank to the merest zephyr, and the waves by
    </p>
    <p>
     degrees diminished. So faint became the breeze in half-an-hour's time,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so intermittent, that he found it patience wasted even to hold the
    </p>
    <p>
     rudder-paddle. The sail hung and was no longer bellied out; as the idle
    </p>
    <p>
     waves rolled under, it flapped against the mast. The heat was now so
    </p>
    <p>
     intolerable, the light reflected from the water increasing the
    </p>
    <p>
     sensation, that he was obliged to make himself some shelter by partly
    </p>
    <p>
     lowering the sail, and hauling the yard athwart the vessel, so that the
    </p>
    <p>
     canvas acted as an awning. Gradually the waves declined in volume, and
    </p>
    <p>
     the gentle breathing of the wind ebbed away, till at last the surface
    </p>
    <p>
     was almost still, and he could feel no perceptible air stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Weary of sitting in the narrow boat, he stood up, but he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     stretch himself sufficiently for the change to be of much use. The long
    </p>
    <p>
     summer day, previously so pleasant, now appeared scarcely endurable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon the silent water the time lingered, for there was nothing to mark
    </p>
    <p>
     its advance, not so much as a shadow beyond that of his own boat. The
    </p>
    <p>
     waves having now no crest, went under the canoe without chafing against
    </p>
    <p>
     it, or rebounding, so that they were noiseless. No fishes rose to the
    </p>
    <p>
     surface. There was nothing living near, except a blue butterfly, which
    </p>
    <p>
     settled on the mast, having ventured thus far from land. The vastness of
    </p>
    <p>
     the sky, over-arching the broad water, the sun, and the motionless
    </p>
    <p>
     filaments of cloud, gave no repose for his gaze, for they were seemingly
    </p>
    <p>
     still. To the weary gaze motion is repose; the waving boughs, the
    </p>
    <p>
     foam-tipped waves, afford positive rest to look at. Such intense
    </p>
    <p>
     stillness as this of the summer sky was oppressive; it was like living
    </p>
    <p>
     in space itself, in the ether above. He welcomed at last the gradual
    </p>
    <p>
     downward direction of the sun, for, as the heat decreased, he could work
    </p>
    <p>
     with the paddle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently he furled the sail, took his paddle, and set his face for the
    </p>
    <p>
     land. He laboured steadily, but made no apparent progress. The canoe was
    </p>
    <p>
     heavy, and the outrigger or beam, which was of material use in sailing,
    </p>
    <p>
     was a drawback to paddling. He worked till his arms grew weary, and
    </p>
    <p>
     still the blue land seemed as far off as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     But by the time the sun began to approach the horizon, his efforts had
    </p>
    <p>
     produced some effect, the shore was visible, and the woods beyond. They
    </p>
    <p>
     were still five miles distant, and he was tired; there was little chance
    </p>
    <p>
     of his reaching it before night. He put his paddle down for refreshment
    </p>
    <p>
     and rest, and while he was thus engaged, a change took place. A faint
    </p>
    <p>
     puff of air came; a second, and a third; a tiny ripple ran along the
    </p>
    <p>
     surface. Now he recollected that he had heard that the mariners depended
    </p>
    <p>
     a great deal on the morning and the evening--the land and the
    </p>
    <p>
     Lake--breeze as they worked along the shore. This was the first breath
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Land breeze. It freshened after a while, and he re-set his sail.
    </p>
    <p>
     An hour or so afterwards he came near the shore; he heard the thrushes
    </p>
    <p>
     singing, and the cuckoo calling, long before he landed. He did not stay
    </p>
    <p>
     to search about for a creek, but ran the canoe on the strand, which was
    </p>
    <p>
     free of reeds or flags, a sign that the waves often beat furiously
    </p>
    <p>
     there, rolling as they must for so many miles. He hauled the canoe up as
    </p>
    <p>
     high as he could, but presently when he looked about him he found that
    </p>
    <p>
     he was on a small and narrow island, with a channel in the rear. Tired
    </p>
    <p>
     as he was, yet anxious for the safety of his canoe, he pushed off again,
    </p>
    <p>
     and paddled round and again beached her with the island between her and
    </p>
    <p>
     the open Lake. Else he feared if a south wind should blow she might be
    </p>
    <p>
     broken to pieces on the strand before his eyes. It was prudent to take
    </p>
    <p>
     the precaution, but, as it happened, the next day the Lake was still.
    </p>
    <p>
     He could see no traces of human occupation upon the island, which was of
    </p>
    <p>
     small extent and nearly bare, and therefore, in the morning, paddled
    </p>
    <p>
     across the channel to the mainland, as he thought. But upon exploring
    </p>
    <p>
     the opposite shore, it proved not to be the mainland, but merely another
    </p>
    <p>
     island. Paddling round it, he tried again, but with the same result; he
    </p>
    <p>
     found nothing but island after island, all narrow, and bearing nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     except bushes. Observing a channel which seemed to go straight in among
    </p>
    <p>
     these islets, he resolved to follow it, and did so (resting at
    </p>
    <p>
     noon-time) the whole morning. As he paddled slowly in, he found the
    </p>
    <p>
     water shallower, and weeds, bulrushes, and reeds became thick, except
    </p>
    <p>
     quite in the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the heat of midday had gone over, he resumed his voyage, and still
    </p>
    <p>
     found the same; islets and banks, more or less covered with hawthorn
    </p>
    <p>
     bushes, willow, elder, and alder, succeeded to islets, fringed round
    </p>
    <p>
     their edges with reeds and reed canary-grass. When he grew weary of
    </p>
    <p>
     paddling, he landed and stayed the night; the next day he went on again,
    </p>
    <p>
     and still for hour after hour rowed in and out among these banks and
    </p>
    <p>
     islets, till he began to think he should never find his way out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The farther he penetrated the more numerous became the waterfowl. Ducks
    </p>
    <p>
     swam among the flags, or rose with a rush and splashing. Coots and
    </p>
    <p>
     moorhens dived and hid in the reeds. The lesser grebe sank at the sound
    </p>
    <p>
     of the paddle like a stone. A strong northern diver raised a wave as he
    </p>
    <p>
     hurried away under the water, his course marked by the undulation above
    </p>
    <p>
     him. Sedge-birds chirped in the willows; black-headed buntings sat on
    </p>
    <p>
     the trees, and watched him without fear. Bearded titmice were there,
    </p>
    <p>
     clinging to the stalks of the sedges, and long-necked herons rose from
    </p>
    <p>
     the reedy places where they love to wade. Blue dragon-flies darted to
    </p>
    <p>
     and fro, or sat on water-plants as if they were flowers. Snakes swam
    </p>
    <p>
     across the channels, vibrating their heads from side to side. Swallows
    </p>
    <p>
     swept over his head. Pike "struck" from the verge of the thick weeds as
    </p>
    <p>
     he came near. Perch rose for insects as they fell helpless into the
    </p>
    <p>
     water.
    </p>
    <p>
     He noticed that the water, though so thick with reeds, was as clear as
    </p>
    <p>
     that in the open Lake; there was no scum such as accumulates in stagnant
    </p>
    <p>
     places. From this he concluded that there must be a current, however
    </p>
    <p>
     slight, perhaps from rivers flowing into this part of the Lake. He felt
    </p>
    <p>
     the strongest desire to explore farther till he reached the mainland,
    </p>
    <p>
     but he reflected that mere exploration was not his object; it would
    </p>
    <p>
     never obtain Aurora for him. There were no signs whatever of human
    </p>
    <p>
     habitation, and from reeds and bulrushes, however interesting, nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     could be gained. Reluctantly, therefore, on the third morning, having
    </p>
    <p>
     passed the night on one of the islets, he turned his canoe, and paddled
    </p>
    <p>
     southwards towards the Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did not for a moment attempt to retrace the channel by which he had
    </p>
    <p>
     entered; it would have been an impossibility; he took advantage of any
    </p>
    <p>
     clear space to push through. It took him as long to get out as it had to
    </p>
    <p>
     get in; it was the afternoon of the fourth day when he at last regained
    </p>
    <p>
     the coast. He rested the remainder of the afternoon, wishing to start
    </p>
    <p>
     fresh in the morning, having determined to follow the line of the shore
    </p>
    <p>
     eastwards, and so gradually to circumnavigate the Lake. If he succeeded
    </p>
    <p>
     in nothing else, that at least would be something to relate to Aurora.
    </p>
    <p>
     The morning rose fair and bright, with a south-westerly air rather than
    </p>
    <p>
     a breeze. He sailed before it; it was so light that his progress could
    </p>
    <p>
     not have exceeded more than three miles an hour. Hour after hour passed
    </p>
    <p>
     away, and still he followed the line of the shore, now going a short way
    </p>
    <p>
     out to skirt an island, and now nearer it to pass between sandbanks. By
    </p>
    <p>
     noon he was so weary of sitting in the canoe that he ran her ashore, and
    </p>
    <p>
     rested awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the very height of the heat of the day when he set forth again,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the wind lighter than in the morning. It had, however, changed a
    </p>
    <p>
     little, and blew now from the west, almost too exactly abaft to suit his
    </p>
    <p>
     craft. He could not make a map while sailing, or observe his position
    </p>
    <p>
     accurately, but it appeared to him that the shore trended towards the
    </p>
    <p>
     south-east, so that he was gradually turning an arc. He supposed from
    </p>
    <p>
     this that he must be approaching the eastern end of the Lake. The water
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed shallower, to judge from the quantity of weeds. Now and then he
    </p>
    <p>
     caught glimpses between the numerous islands of the open Lake, and
    </p>
    <p>
     there, too, the weeds covered the surface in many places.
    </p>
    <p>
     In an hour or two the breeze increased considerably, and travelling so
    </p>
    <p>
     much quicker, he found it required all his dexterity to steer past the
    </p>
    <p>
     islands and clear the banks upon which he was drifting. Once or twice he
    </p>
    <p>
     grazed the willows that overhung the water, and heard the keel of the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe drag on the bottom. As much as possible he bore away from the
    </p>
    <p>
     mainland, steering south-east, thinking to find deeper water, and to be
    </p>
    <p>
     free of the islets. He succeeded in the first, but the islets were now
    </p>
    <p>
     so numerous that he could not tell where the open Lake was. The farther
    </p>
    <p>
     the afternoon advanced, the more the breeze freshened, till
    </p>
    <p>
     occasionally, as it blew between the islands, it struck his mast almost
    </p>
    <p>
     with the force of a gale. Felix welcomed the wind, which would enable
    </p>
    <p>
     him to make great progress before evening. If such favouring breezes
    </p>
    <p>
     would continue, he could circumnavigate the waters in a comparatively
    </p>
    <p>
     short time, and might return to Aurora, so far, at least, successful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hope filled his heart, and he sang to the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The waves could not rise among these islands, which intercepted them
    </p>
    <p>
     before they could roll far enough to gather force, so that he had all
    </p>
    <p>
     the advantage of the gale without its risks. Except a light haze all
    </p>
    <p>
     round the horizon, the sky was perfectly clear, and it was pleasant now
    </p>
    <p>
     the strong current of air cooled the sun's heat. As he came round the
    </p>
    <p>
     islands he constantly met and disturbed parties of waterfowl, mallards,
    </p>
    <p>
     and coots. Sometimes they merely hid in the weeds, sometimes they rose,
    </p>
    <p>
     and when they did so passed to his rear.

    <p>
     DISCOVERIES
    </p>
    <p>
     This little circumstance of the mallards always flying over him and away
    </p>
    <p>
     behind, when flushed, presently made Felix speculate on the cause, and
    </p>
    <p>
     he kept a closer watch. He now saw (what had, indeed, been going on for
    </p>
    <p>
     some time) that there was a ceaseless stream of waterfowl, mallards,
    </p>
    <p>
     ducks, coots, moorhens, and lesser grebes coming towards him, swimming
    </p>
    <p>
     to the westward. As they met him they parted and let him through, or
    </p>
    <p>
     rose and went over. Next he noticed that the small birds on the islands
    </p>
    <p>
     were also travelling in the same direction, that is against the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
     They did not seem in any haste, but flitted from islet to islet, bush to
    </p>
    <p>
     tree, feeding and gossiping as they went; still the movement was
    </p>
    <p>
     distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finches, linnets, blackbirds, thrushes, wrens, and whitethroats, and
    </p>
    <p>
     many others, all passed him, and he could see the same thing going on to
    </p>
    <p>
     his right and left. Felix became much interested in this migration, all
    </p>
    <p>
     the more singular as it was the nesting-time, and hundreds of these
    </p>
    <p>
     birds must have left their nests with eggs or young behind them. Nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     that he could think of offered an adequate explanation. He imagined he
    </p>
    <p>
     saw shoals of fishes going the same way, but the surface of the water
    </p>
    <p>
     being ruffled, and the canoe sailing rapidly, he could not be certain.
    </p>
    <p>
     About an hour after he first observed the migration the stream of birds
    </p>
    <p>
     ceased suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no waterfowls in the water, and no finches in the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had evidently all passed. Those in the van of the migratory army
    </p>
    <p>
     were no doubt scattered and thinly distributed, so that he had been
    </p>
    <p>
     meeting the flocks a long while before he suspected it. The nearer he
    </p>
    <p>
     approached their centre the thicker they became, and on getting through
    </p>
    <p>
     that he found a solitude. The weeds were thicker than ever, so that he
    </p>
    <p>
     had constantly to edge away from where he supposed the mainland to lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there were no waterfowls and no birds on the islets. Suddenly as he
    </p>
    <p>
     rounded a large island he saw what for the moment he imagined to be a
    </p>
    <p>
     line of white surf, but the next instant he recognised a solid mass, as
    </p>
    <p>
     it were, of swallows and martins flying just over the surface of the
    </p>
    <p>
     water straight towards him. He had no time to notice how far they
    </p>
    <p>
     extended before they had gone by him with a rushing sound. Turning to
    </p>
    <p>
     look back, he saw them continue directly west in the teeth of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like the water and the islands, the sky was now cleared of birds, and
    </p>
    <p>
     not a swallow remained. Felix asked himself if he were running into some
    </p>
    <p>
     unknown danger, but he could not conceive any. The only thing that
    </p>
    <p>
     occurred to him was the possibility of the wind rising to a hurricane;
    </p>
    <p>
     that gave him no alarm, because the numerous islands would afford
    </p>
    <p>
     shelter. So complete was the shelter in some places, that as he passed
    </p>
    <p>
     along his sail drew above, while the surface of the water, almost
    </p>
    <p>
     surrounded with bushes and willows, was smooth. No matter to how many
    </p>
    <p>
     quarters of the compass the wind might veer, he should still be able to
    </p>
    <p>
     get under the lee of one or other of the banks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sky remained without clouds; there was nothing but a slight haze,
    </p>
    <p>
     which he sometimes fancied looked thicker in front or to the eastward.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was nothing whatever to cause the least uneasiness; on the
    </p>
    <p>
     contrary, his curiosity was aroused, and he was desirous of discovering
    </p>
    <p>
     what it was that had startled the birds. After a while the water became
    </p>
    <p>
     rather more open, with sandbanks instead of islands, so that he could
    </p>
    <p>
     see around him for a considerable distance. By a large bank, behind
    </p>
    <p>
     which the ripple was stilled, he saw a low wave advancing towards him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and moving against the wind. It was followed by two others at short
    </p>
    <p>
     intervals, and though he could not see them, he had no doubt shoals of
    </p>
    <p>
     fishes were passing and had raised the undulations.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sedges on the sandbanks appeared brown and withered, as if it had
    </p>
    <p>
     been autumn instead of early summer. The flags were brown at the tip,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the aquatic grasses had dwindled. They looked as if they could not
    </p>
    <p>
     grow, and had reached but half their natural height. From the low
    </p>
    <p>
     willows the leaves were dropping, faded and yellow, and the thorn bushes
    </p>
    <p>
     were shrivelled and covered with the white cocoons of caterpillars. The
    </p>
    <p>
     farther he sailed the more desolate the banks seemed, and trees ceased
    </p>
    <p>
     altogether. Even the willows were fewer and stunted, and the highest
    </p>
    <p>
     thorn bush was not above his chest. His vessel was now more exposed to
    </p>
    <p>
     the wind, so that he drove past the banks and scattered islands rapidly,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he noticed that there was not so much as a crow on them. Upturned
    </p>
    <p>
     mussel-shells, glittering in the sunshine, showed where crows had been
    </p>
    <p>
     at work, but there was not one now visible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix thought that the water had lost its clearness and had become
    </p>
    <p>
     thick, which he put down to the action of the wavelets disturbing the
    </p>
    <p>
     sand in the shallows. Ahead the haze, or mist, was now much thicker, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was apparently not over a mile distant. It hid the islands and concealed
    </p>
    <p>
     everything. He expected to enter it immediately, but it receded as he
    </p>
    <p>
     approached. Along the strand of an island he passed there was a dark
    </p>
    <p>
     line like a stain, and in still water under the lee the surface was
    </p>
    <p>
     covered with a floating scum. Felix, on seeing this, at once concluded
    </p>
    <p>
     that he had unknowingly entered a gulf, and had left the main Lake, for
    </p>
    <p>
     the only place he had ever seen scum before was at the extremity of a
    </p>
    <p>
     creek near home, where the water was partly stagnant on a marshy level.
    </p>
    <p>
     The water of the Lake was proverbial for its purity and clearness.
    </p>
    <p>
     He kept, therefore, a sharp look-out, expecting every moment to sight
    </p>
    <p>
     the end of the gulf or creek in which he supposed himself sailing, so
    </p>
    <p>
     that he might be ready to lower his sail. By degrees the wind had risen
    </p>
    <p>
     till it now blew with fury, but the numerous sandflats so broke up the
    </p>
    <p>
     waves that he found no inconvenience from them. One solitary gull passed
    </p>
    <p>
     over at a great height, flying steadily westwards against the wind. The
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe now began to overtake fragments of scum drifting before the wind,
    </p>
    <p>
     and rising up and down on the ripples. Once he saw a broad piece rise to
    </p>
    <p>
     the surface together with a quantity of bubbles. None of the sandbanks
    </p>
    <p>
     now rose more than a foot or so above the surface, and were entirely
    </p>
    <p>
     bare, mere sand and gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mist ahead was sensibly nearer, and yet it eluded him; it was of a
    </p>
    <p>
     faint yellow, and though so thin, obscured everything where it hovered.
    </p>
    <p>
     From out of the mist there presently appeared a vast stretch of weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
     They floated on the surface and undulated to the wavelets, a pale
    </p>
    <p>
     yellowish green expanse. Felix was hesitating whether to lower his sail
    </p>
    <p>
     or attempt to drive over them, when, as he advanced and the mist
    </p>
    <p>
     retreated, he saw open water beyond. The weeds extended on either hand
    </p>
    <p>
     as far as he could see, but they were only a narrow band, and he
    </p>
    <p>
     hesitated no longer. He felt the canoe graze the bottom once as he
    </p>
    <p>
     sailed over the weeds. The water was free of sandbanks beyond them, but
    </p>
    <p>
     he could see large islands looming in several directions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing behind him he perceived that the faint yellow mist had closed
    </p>
    <p>
     in and now encircled him. It came with two or three hundred yards, and
    </p>
    <p>
     was not affected by the wind, rough as it was. Quite suddenly he noticed
    </p>
    <p>
     that the water on which the canoe floated was black. The wavelets which
    </p>
    <p>
     rolled alongside were black, and the slight spray that occasionally flew
    </p>
    <p>
     on board was black, and stained the side of the vessel. This greatly
    </p>
    <p>
     astonished and almost shocked him; it was so opposite and contrary to
    </p>
    <p>
     all his ideas about the Lake, the very mirror of purity. He leant over,
    </p>
    <p>
     and dipped up a little in the palm of his hand; it did not appear black
    </p>
    <p>
     in such a small quantity, it seemed a rusty brown, but he became aware
    </p>
    <p>
     of an offensive odour. The odour clung to his hand, and he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     remove it, to his great disgust. It was like nothing he had ever smelt
    </p>
    <p>
     before, and not in the least like the vapour of marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
     By now being some distance from any island, the wavelets increased in
    </p>
    <p>
     size, and spray flew on board, wetting everything with this black
    </p>
    <p>
     liquid. Instead of level marshes and the end of the gulf, it appeared as
    </p>
    <p>
     if the water were deep, and also as if it widened. Exposed to the full
    </p>
    <p>
     press of the gale, Felix began to fear that he should not be able to
    </p>
    <p>
     return very easily against it. He did not know what to do. The horrid
    </p>
    <p>
     blackness of the water disposed him to turn about and tack out; on the
    </p>
    <p>
     other hand, having set out on a voyage of discovery, and having now
    </p>
    <p>
     found something different to the other parts of the Lake, he did not
    </p>
    <p>
     like to retreat. He sailed on, thinking to presently pass these
    </p>
    <p>
     loathsome waters.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was now hungry, and indeed thirsty, but was unable to drink because
    </p>
    <p>
     he had no water-barrel. No vessel sailing on the Lake ever carried a
    </p>
    <p>
     water-barrel, since such pure water was always under their bows. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     cramped, too, with long sitting in the canoe, and the sun was
    </p>
    <p>
     perceptibly sloping in the west. He determined to land and rest, and
    </p>
    <p>
     with this purpose steered to the right under the lee of a large island,
    </p>
    <p>
     so large, indeed, that he was not certain it was not part of the
    </p>
    <p>
     mainland or one side of the gulf. The water was very deep close up to
    </p>
    <p>
     the shore, but, to his annoyance, the strand appeared black, as if
    </p>
    <p>
     soaked with the dark water. He skirted along somewhat farther, and found
    </p>
    <p>
     a ledge of low rocks stretching out into the Lake, so that he was
    </p>
    <p>
     obliged to run ashore before coming to these.
    </p>
    <p>
     On landing, the black strand, to his relief, was fairly firm, for he had
    </p>
    <p>
     dreaded sinking to the knees in it; but its appearance was so unpleasant
    </p>
    <p>
     that he could not bring himself to sit down. He walked on towards the
    </p>
    <p>
     ledge of rocks, thinking to find a pleasanter place there. They were
    </p>
    <p>
     stratified, and he stepped on them to climb up, when his foot went deep
    </p>
    <p>
     into the apparently hard rock. He kicked it, and his shoe penetrated it
    </p>
    <p>
     as if it had been soft sand. It was impossible to climb up the reef. The
    </p>
    <p>
     ground rose inland, and curious to see around him as far as possible, he
    </p>
    <p>
     ascended the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the summit, however, he could not see farther than on the shore,
    </p>
    <p>
     for the pale yellow mist rose up round him, and hid the canoe on the
    </p>
    <p>
     strand. The extreme desolation of the dark and barren ground repelled
    </p>
    <p>
     him; there was not a tree, bush, or living creature, not so much as a
    </p>
    <p>
     buzzing fly. He turned to go down, and then for the first time noticed
    </p>
    <p>
     that the disk of the sun was surrounded with a faint blue rim,
    </p>
    <p>
     apparently caused by the yellow vapour. So much were the rays shorn of
    </p>
    <p>
     their glare, that he could look at the sun without any distress, but its
    </p>
    <p>
     heat seemed to have increased, though it was now late in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Descending towards the canoe, he fancied the wind had veered
    </p>
    <p>
     considerably. He sat down in the boat, and took some food; it was
    </p>
    <p>
     without relish, as he had nothing to drink, and the great heat had tired
    </p>
    <p>
     him. Wearily, and without thinking, he pushed off the canoe; she slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     floated out, when, as he was about to hoist up the sail, a tremendous
    </p>
    <p>
     gust of wind struck him down on the thwarts, and nearly carried him
    </p>
    <p>
     overboard. He caught the mast as he fell, or over he must have gone into
    </p>
    <p>
     the black waves. Before he could recover himself, she drifted against
    </p>
    <p>
     the ledge of rocks, which broke down and sank before the bow, so that
    </p>
    <p>
     she passed over uninjured.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix got out a paddle, and directed the canoe as well as he could; the
    </p>
    <p>
     fury of the wind was irresistible, and he could only drive before it. In
    </p>
    <p>
     a few minutes, as he was swept along the shore, he was carried between
    </p>
    <p>
     it and another immense reef. Here, the waves being broken and less
    </p>
    <p>
     powerful, he contrived to get the heavy canoe ashore again, and, jumping
    </p>
    <p>
     out, dragged her up as far as he could on the land. When he had done
    </p>
    <p>
     this, he found to his surprise that the gale had ceased. The tremendous
    </p>
    <p>
     burst of wind had been succeeded by a perfect calm, and the waves had
    </p>
    <p>
     already lost their violent impetus.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was a relief, for he had feared that the canoe would be utterly
    </p>
    <p>
     broken to pieces; but soon he began to doubt if it were an unmixed
    </p>
    <p>
     benefit, as without a wind he could not move from this dismal place that
    </p>
    <p>
     evening. He was too weary to paddle far. He sat on the canoe to rest
    </p>
    <p>
     himself, and, whether from fatigue or other causes, fell asleep. His
    </p>
    <p>
     head heavily dropping on his chest partly woke him several times, but
    </p>
    <p>
     his lassitude overcame the discomfort, and he slept on. When he got up
    </p>
    <p>
     he felt dazed and unrefreshed, as if sleeping had been hard work. He was
    </p>
    <p>
     extremely thirsty, and oppressed with the increasing heat. The sun had
    </p>
    <p>
     sunk, or rather was so low that the high ground hid it from sight.

    <p>
     STRANGE THINGS
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought struck Felix that perhaps he might find a spring somewhere
    </p>
    <p>
     in the island, and he started at once up over the hill. At the top he
    </p>
    <p>
     paused. The sun had not sunk, but had disappeared as a disk. In its
    </p>
    <p>
     place was a billow of blood, for so it looked, a vast up-heaved billow
    </p>
    <p>
     of glowing blood surging on the horizon. Over it flickered a tint of
    </p>
    <p>
     palest blue, like that seen in fire. The black waters reflected the
    </p>
    <p>
     glow, and the yellow vapour around was suffused with it. Though
    </p>
    <p>
     momentarily startled, Felix did not much heed these appearances; he was
    </p>
    <p>
     still dazed and heavy from his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     He went on, looking for a spring, sometimes walking on firm ground,
    </p>
    <p>
     sometimes sinking to the ankle in a friable soil like black sand. The
    </p>
    <p>
     ground looked, indeed, as if it had been burnt, but there were no
    </p>
    <p>
     charred stumps of timber such as he had seen on the sites of forest
    </p>
    <p>
     fires. The extreme dreariness seemed to oppress his spirits, and he went
    </p>
    <p>
     on and on in a heavy waking dream. Descending into a plain, he lost
    </p>
    <p>
     sight of the flaming sunset and the black waters. In the level plain the
    </p>
    <p>
     desolation was yet more marked; there was not a grass-blade or plant;
    </p>
    <p>
     the surface was hard, black, and burned, resembling iron, and indeed in
    </p>
    <p>
     places it resounded to his feet, though he supposed that was the echo
    </p>
    <p>
     from hollow passages beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Several times he shook himself, straightened himself up, and endeavoured
    </p>
    <p>
     to throw off the sense of drowsy weight which increased upon him. He
    </p>
    <p>
     could not do so; he walked with bent back, and crept, as it were, over
    </p>
    <p>
     the iron land which radiated heat. A shimmer like that of water appeared
    </p>
    <p>
     in front; he quickened his pace, but could not get to it, and realized
    </p>
    <p>
     presently that it was a mirage which receded as he advanced. There was
    </p>
    <p>
     no pleasant summer twilight; the sunset was succeeded by an indefinite
    </p>
    <p>
     gloom, and while this shadow hung overhead the yellow vapour around was
    </p>
    <p>
     faintly radiant. Felix suddenly stopped, having stepped, as he thought,
    </p>
    <p>
     on a skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another glance, however, showed that it was merely the impression of
    </p>
    <p>
     one, the actual bones had long since disappeared. The ribs, the skull,
    </p>
    <p>
     and limbs were drawn on the black ground in white lines as if it had
    </p>
    <p>
     been done with a broad piece of chalk. Close by he found three or four
    </p>
    <p>
     more, intertangled and superimposed as if the unhappy beings had fallen
    </p>
    <p>
     partly across each other, and in that position had mouldered away
    </p>
    <p>
     leaving nothing but their outline. From among a variety of objects that
    </p>
    <p>
     were scattered about Felix picked up something that shone; it was a
    </p>
    <p>
     diamond bracelet of one large stone, and a small square of blue china
    </p>
    <p>
     tile with a curious heraldic animal drawn on it. Evidently these had
    </p>
    <p>
     belonged to one or other of the party who had perished.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though startled at the first sight, it was curious that Felix felt so
    </p>
    <p>
     little horror; the idea did not occur to him that he was in danger as
    </p>
    <p>
     these had been. Inhaling the gaseous emanations from the soil and
    </p>
    <p>
     contained in the yellow vapour, he had become narcotized, and moved as
    </p>
    <p>
     if under the influence of opium, while wide awake, and capable of
    </p>
    <p>
     rational conduct. His senses were deadened, and did not carry the usual
    </p>
    <p>
     vivid impression to the mind; he saw things as if they were afar off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Accidentally looking back, he found that his footmarks, as far as he
    </p>
    <p>
     could see, shone with a phosphoric light like that of "touchwood" in the
    </p>
    <p>
     dark. Near at hand they did not shine; the appearance did not come till
    </p>
    <p>
     some few minutes had elapsed. His track was visible behind till the
    </p>
    <p>
     vapour hid it. As the evening drew on the vapour became more luminous,
    </p>
    <p>
     and somewhat resembled an aurora.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still anxious for water, he proceeded as straight ahead as he could, and
    </p>
    <p>
     shortly became conscious of an indefinite cloud which kept pace with him
    </p>
    <p>
     on either side. When he turned to look at either of the clouds, the one
    </p>
    <p>
     looked at disappeared. It was not condensed enough to be visible to
    </p>
    <p>
     direct vision, yet he was aware of it from the corner of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shapeless and threatening, the gloomy thickness of the air floated
    </p>
    <p>
     beside him like the vague monster of a dream. Sometimes he fancied that
    </p>
    <p>
     he saw an arm or a limb among the folds of the cloud, or an approach to
    </p>
    <p>
     a face; the instant he looked it vanished. Marching at each hand these
    </p>
    <p>
     vapours bore him horrible company.
    </p>
    <p>
     His brain became unsteady, and flickering things moved about him; yet,
    </p>
    <p>
     though alarmed, he was not afraid; his senses were not acute enough for
    </p>
    <p>
     fear. The heat increased; his hands were intolerably hot as if he had
    </p>
    <p>
     been in a fever, he panted; but did not perspire. A dry heat like an
    </p>
    <p>
     oven burned his blood in his veins. His head felt enlarged, and his eyes
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed alight; he could see these two globes of phosphoric light under
    </p>
    <p>
     his brows. They seemed to stand out so that he could see them. He
    </p>
    <p>
     thought his path straight, it was really curved; nor did he know that he
    </p>
    <p>
     staggered as he walked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Presently a white object appeared ahead; and on coming to it, he found
    </p>
    <p>
     it was a wall, white as snow, with some kind of crystal. He touched it,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the wall fell immediately, with a crushing sound as if pulverised,
    </p>
    <p>
     and disappeared in a vast cavern at his feet. Beyond this chasm he came
    </p>
    <p>
     to more walls like those of houses, such as would be left if the roofs
    </p>
    <p>
     fell in. He carefully avoided touching them, for they seemed as brittle
    </p>
    <p>
     as glass, and merely a white powder having no consistency at all. As he
    </p>
    <p>
     advanced these remnants of buildings increased in number, so that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     to wind in and out round them. In some places the crystallized wall had
    </p>
    <p>
     fallen of itself, and he could see down into the cavern; for the house
    </p>
    <p>
     had either been built partly underground, or, which was more probable,
    </p>
    <p>
     the ground had risen. Whether the walls had been of bricks or stone or
    </p>
    <p>
     other material he could not tell; they were now like salt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon wearying of winding round these walls, Felix returned and retraced
    </p>
    <p>
     his steps till he was outside the place, and then went on towards the
    </p>
    <p>
     left. Not long after, as he still walked in a dream and without feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     his feet, he descended a slight slope and found the ground change in
    </p>
    <p>
     colour from black to a dull red. In his dazed state he had taken several
    </p>
    <p>
     steps into this red before he noticed that it was liquid, unctuous and
    </p>
    <p>
     slimy, like a thick oil. It deepened rapidly and was already over his
    </p>
    <p>
     shoes; he returned to the black shore and stood looking out over the
    </p>
    <p>
     water, if such it could be called.
    </p>
    <p>
     The luminous yellow vapour had now risen a height of ten or fifteen
    </p>
    <p>
     feet, and formed a roof both over the land and over the red water, under
    </p>
    <p>
     which it was possible to see for a great distance. The surface of the
    </p>
    <p>
     red oil or viscid liquid was perfectly smooth, and, indeed, it did not
    </p>
    <p>
     seem as if any wind could rouse a wave on it, much less that a swell
    </p>
    <p>
     should be left after the gale had gone down. Disappointed in his search
    </p>
    <p>
     for water to drink, Felix mechanically turned to go back.
    </p>
    <p>
     He followed his luminous footmarks, which he could see a long way before
    </p>
    <p>
     him. His trail curved so much that he made many short cuts across the
    </p>
    <p>
     winding line he had left. His weariness was now so intense that all
    </p>
    <p>
     feeling had departed. His feet, his limbs, his arms, and hands were
    </p>
    <p>
     numbed. The subtle poison of the emanations from the earth had begun to
    </p>
    <p>
     deaden his nerves. It seemed a full hour or more to him till he reached
    </p>
    <p>
     the spot where the skeletons were drawn in white upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     He passed a few yards to one side of them, and stumbled over a heap of
    </p>
    <p>
     something which he did not observe, as it was black like the level
    </p>
    <p>
     ground. It emitted a metallic sound, and looking he saw that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     kicked his foot against a great heap of money. The coins were black as
    </p>
    <p>
     ink; he picked up a handful and went on. Hitherto Felix had accepted all
    </p>
    <p>
     that he saw as something so strange as to be unaccountable. During his
    </p>
    <p>
     advance into this region in the canoe he had in fact become slowly
    </p>
    <p>
     stupefied by the poisonous vapour he had inhaled. His mind was partly in
    </p>
    <p>
     abeyance; it acted, but only after some time had elapsed. He now at last
    </p>
    <p>
     began to realize his position; the finding of the heap of blackened
    </p>
    <p>
     money touched a chord of memory. These skeletons were the miserable
    </p>
    <p>
     relics of men who had ventured, in search of ancient treasures, into the
    </p>
    <p>
     deadly marshes over the site of the mightiest city of former days. The
    </p>
    <p>
     deserted and utterly extinct city of London was under his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had penetrated into the midst of that dreadful place, of which he had
    </p>
    <p>
     heard many a tradition: how the earth was poison, the water poison, the
    </p>
    <p>
     air poison, the very light of heaven, falling through such an
    </p>
    <p>
     atmosphere, poison. There were said to be places where the earth was on
    </p>
    <p>
     fire and belched forth sulphurous fumes, supposed to be from the
    </p>
    <p>
     combustion of the enormous stores of strange and unknown chemicals
    </p>
    <p>
     collected by the wonderful people of those times. Upon the surface of
    </p>
    <p>
     the water there was a greenish-yellow oil, to touch which was death to
    </p>
    <p>
     any creature; it was the very essence of corruption. Sometimes it
    </p>
    <p>
     floated before the wind, and fragments became attached to reeds or flags
    </p>
    <p>
     far from the place itself. If a moorhen or duck chanced to rub the reed,
    </p>
    <p>
     and but one drop stuck to its feathers, it forthwith died. Of the red
    </p>
    <p>
     water he had not heard, nor of the black, into which he had unwittingly
    </p>
    <p>
     sailed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ghastly beings haunted the site of so many crimes, shapeless monsters,
    </p>
    <p>
     hovering by night, and weaving a fearful dance. Frequently they caught
    </p>
    <p>
     fire, as it seemed, and burned as they flew or floated in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Remembering these stories, which in part, at least, now seemed to be
    </p>
    <p>
     true, Felix glanced aside, where the cloud still kept pace with him, and
    </p>
    <p>
     involuntarily put his hands to his ears lest the darkness of the air
    </p>
    <p>
     should whisper some horror of old times. The earth on which he walked,
    </p>
    <p>
     the black earth, leaving phosphoric footmarks behind him, was composed
    </p>
    <p>
     of the mouldered bodies of millions of men who had passed away in the
    </p>
    <p>
     centuries during which the city existed. He shuddered as he moved; he
    </p>
    <p>
     hastened, yet could not go fast, his numbed limbs would not permit him.
    </p>
    <p>
     He dreaded lest he should fall and sleep, and wake no more, like the
    </p>
    <p>
     searchers after treasure; treasure which they had found only to lose for
    </p>
    <p>
     ever. He looked around, supposing that he might see the gleaming head
    </p>
    <p>
     and shoulders of the half-buried giant, of which he recollected he had
    </p>
    <p>
     been told. The giant was punished for some crime by being buried to the
    </p>
    <p>
     chest in the earth; fire incessantly consumed his head and played about
    </p>
    <p>
     it, yet it was not destroyed. The learned thought, if such a thing
    </p>
    <p>
     really existed, that it must be the upper part of an ancient brazen
    </p>
    <p>
     statue, kept bright by the action of acid in the atmosphere, and shining
    </p>
    <p>
     with reflected light. Felix did not see it, and shortly afterwards
    </p>
    <p>
     surmounted the hill, and looked down upon his canoe. It was on fire!

    <p>
     FIERY VAPOURS
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix tried to run, but his feet would not rise from the ground; his
    </p>
    <p>
     limbs were numb as in a nightmare; he could not get there. His body
    </p>
    <p>
     would not obey his will. In reality he did move, but more slowly than
    </p>
    <p>
     when he walked. By degrees approaching the canoe his alarm subsided, for
    </p>
    <p>
     although it burned it was not injured; the canvas of the sail was not
    </p>
    <p>
     even scorched. When he got to it the flames had disappeared; like
    </p>
    <p>
     Jack-o'-the-lantern, the phosphoric fire receded from him. With all his
    </p>
    <p>
     strength he strove to launch her, yet paused, for over the surface of
    </p>
    <p>
     the black water, now smooth and waveless, played immense curling flames,
    </p>
    <p>
     stretching out like endless serpents, weaving, winding, rolling over
    </p>
    <p>
     each other. Suddenly they contracted into a ball, which shone with a
    </p>
    <p>
     steady light, and was as large as the full moon. The ball swept along,
    </p>
    <p>
     rose a little, and from it flew out long streamers till it was unwound
    </p>
    <p>
     in fiery threads.
    </p>
    <p>
     But remembering that the flames had not even scorched the canvas, he
    </p>
    <p>
     pushed the canoe afloat, determined at any risk to leave this dreadful
    </p>
    <p>
     place. To his joy he felt a faint air rising; it cooled his forehead,
    </p>
    <p>
     but was not enough to fill the sail. He paddled with all the strength he
    </p>
    <p>
     had left. The air seemed to come from exactly the opposite direction to
    </p>
    <p>
     what it had previously blown, some point of east he supposed. Labour as
    </p>
    <p>
     hard as he would, the canoe moved slowly, being so heavy. It seemed as
    </p>
    <p>
     if the black water was thick and clung to her, retarding motion. Still,
    </p>
    <p>
     he did move, and in time (it seemed, indeed, a time) he left the island,
    </p>
    <p>
     which disappeared in the luminous vapours. Uncertain as to the
    </p>
    <p>
     direction, he got his compass, but it would not act; the needle had no
    </p>
    <p>
     life, it swung and came to rest, pointing any way as it chanced. It was
    </p>
    <p>
     demagnetized. Felix resolved to trust to the wind, which he was certain
    </p>
    <p>
     blew from the opposite quarter, and would therefore carry him out. The
    </p>
    <p>
     stars he could not see for the vapour, which formed a roof above him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wind was rising, but in uncertain gusts; however, he hoisted the
    </p>
    <p>
     sail, and floated slowly before it. Nothing but excitement could have
    </p>
    <p>
     kept him awake. Reclining in the canoe, he watched the serpent-like
    </p>
    <p>
     flames playing over the surface, and forced himself by sheer power of
    </p>
    <p>
     will not to sleep. The two dark clouds which had accompanied him to the
    </p>
    <p>
     shore now faded away, and the cooling wind enabled him to bear up better
    </p>
    <p>
     against his parching thirst. His hope was to reach the clear and
    </p>
    <p>
     beautiful Lake; his dread that in the uncertain light he might strike a
    </p>
    <p>
     concealed sandbank and become firmly fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Twice he passed islands, distinguishable as masses of visible darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the twisted flames played up to the shore, and the luminous vapour
    </p>
    <p>
     overhung the ground, the island itself appeared as a black mass. The
    </p>
    <p>
     wind became by degrees steadier, and the canoe shot swiftly over the
    </p>
    <p>
     water. His hopes rose; he sat up and kept a keener look-out ahead. All
    </p>
    <p>
     at once the canoe shook as if she had struck a rock. She vibrated from
    </p>
    <p>
     one end to the other, and stopped for a moment in her course. Felix
    </p>
    <p>
     sprang up alarmed. At the same instant a bellowing noise reached him,
    </p>
    <p>
     succeeded by a frightful belching and roaring, as if a volcano had burst
    </p>
    <p>
     forth under the surface of the water; he looked back but could see
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing. The canoe had not touched ground; she sailed as rapidly as
    </p>
    <p>
     before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again the shock, and again the hideous roaring, as if some force beneath
    </p>
    <p>
     the water were forcing itself up, vast bubbles rising and turning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately it was at a great distance. Hardly was it silent before it
    </p>
    <p>
     was reiterated for the third time. Next Felix felt the canoe heave up,
    </p>
    <p>
     and he was aware that a large roller had passed under him. A second and
    </p>
    <p>
     a third followed. They were without crests, and were not raised by the
    </p>
    <p>
     wind; they obviously started from the scene of the disturbance. Soon
    </p>
    <p>
     afterwards the canoe moved quicker, and he detected a strong current
    </p>
    <p>
     setting in the direction he was sailing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The noise did not recur, nor did any more rollers pass under. Felix felt
    </p>
    <p>
     better and less dazed, but his weariness and sleepiness increased every
    </p>
    <p>
     moment. He fancied that the serpent flames were less brilliant and
    </p>
    <p>
     farther apart, and that the luminous vapour was thinner. How long he sat
    </p>
    <p>
     at the rudder he could not tell; he noticed that it seemed to grow
    </p>
    <p>
     darker, the serpent flames faded away, and the luminous vapour was
    </p>
    <p>
     succeeded by something like the natural gloom of night. At last he saw a
    </p>
    <p>
     star overhead, and hailed it with joy. He thought of Aurora; the next
    </p>
    <p>
     instant he fell back in the canoe firm asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     His arm, however, still retained the rudder-paddle in position, so that
    </p>
    <p>
     the canoe sped on with equal swiftness. She would have struck more than
    </p>
    <p>
     one of the sandbanks and islets had it not been for the strong current
    </p>
    <p>
     that was running. Instead of carrying her against the banks this warded
    </p>
    <p>
     her off, for it drew her between the islets in the channels where it ran
    </p>
    <p>
     fastest, and the undertow, where it struck the shore, bore her back from
    </p>
    <p>
     the land. Driving before the wind, the canoe swept onward steadily to
    </p>
    <p>
     the west. In an hour it had passed the line of the black water, and
    </p>
    <p>
     entered the sweet Lake. Another hour and all trace of the marshes had
    </p>
    <p>
     utterly disappeared, the last faint glow of the vapour had vanished. The
    </p>
    <p>
     dawn of the coming summer's day appeared, and the sky became a lovely
    </p>
    <p>
     azure. The canoe sailed on, but Felix remained immovable in slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long since the strong current had ceased, it scarcely extended into the
    </p>
    <p>
     sweet waters, and the wind only impelled the canoe. As the sun rose the
    </p>
    <p>
     breeze gradually fell away, and in an hour or so there was only a light
    </p>
    <p>
     air. The canoe had left most of the islets and was approaching the open
    </p>
    <p>
     Lake when, as she passed almost the last, the yard caught the
    </p>
    <p>
     overhanging branch of a willow, the canoe swung round and grounded
    </p>
    <p>
     gently under the shadow of the tree. For some time the little wavelets
    </p>
    <p>
     beat against the side of the boat; gradually they ceased, and the clear
    </p>
    <p>
     and beautiful water became still. Felix slept till nearly noon, when he
    </p>
    <p>
     awoke and sat up. At the sudden movement a pike struck, and two moorhens
    </p>
    <p>
     scuttled out of the water into the grass on the shore. A thrush was
    </p>
    <p>
     singing sweetly, whitethroats were busy in the bushes, and swallows
    </p>
    <p>
     swept by overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix drew a long deep breath of intense relief; it was like awakening
    </p>
    <p>
     in Paradise. He snatched up a cup, dipped, and satisfied his craving
    </p>
    <p>
     thirst, then washed his hands over the side, and threw the water over
    </p>
    <p>
     his face. But when he came to stand up and move, he found that his limbs
    </p>
    <p>
     were almost powerless. Like a child he tottered, his joints had no
    </p>
    <p>
     strength, his legs tingled as if they had been benumbed. He was so weak
    </p>
    <p>
     he crawled on all fours along to the mast, furled the sail kneeling, and
    </p>
    <p>
     dragged himself rather than stepped ashore with the painter. The instant
    </p>
    <p>
     he had fastened the rope to a branch, he threw himself at full length on
    </p>
    <p>
     the grass, and grasped a handful of it. Merely to touch the grass after
    </p>
    <p>
     such an experience was intense delight.
    </p>
    <p>
     The song of the thrush, the chatter of the whitethroats, the sight of a
    </p>
    <p>
     hedge-sparrow, gave him inexpressible pleasure. Lying on the sward he
    </p>
    <p>
     watched the curves traced by the swallows in the sky. From the sedges
    </p>
    <p>
     came the curious cry of the moorhen; a bright kingfisher went by. He
    </p>
    <p>
     rested as he had never rested before. His whole body, his whole being
    </p>
    <p>
     was resigned to rest. It was fully two hours before he rose and crept on
    </p>
    <p>
     all fours into the canoe for food. There was only sufficient left for
    </p>
    <p>
     one meal, but that gave him no concern now he was out of the marshes; he
    </p>
    <p>
     could fish and use his crossbow.
    </p>
    <p>
     He now observed what had escaped him during the night, the canoe was
    </p>
    <p>
     black from end to end. Stem, stern, gunwale, thwart, outrigger, mast and
    </p>
    <p>
     sail were black. The stain did not come off on being touched, it seemed
    </p>
    <p>
     burnt in. As he leaned over the side to dip water, and saw his
    </p>
    <p>
     reflection, he started; his face was black, his clothes were black, his
    </p>
    <p>
     hair black. In his eagerness to drink, the first time, he had noticed
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing. His hands were less dark; contact with the paddle and ropes had
    </p>
    <p>
     partly rubbed it off, he supposed. He washed, but the water did not
    </p>
    <p>
     materially diminish the discoloration.
    </p>
    <p>
     After eating, he returned to the grass and rested again; and it was not
    </p>
    <p>
     till the sun was sinking that he felt any return of vigour. Still weak,
    </p>
    <p>
     but able now to walk, leaning on a stick, he began to make a camp for
    </p>
    <p>
     the coming night. But a few scraps, the remnant of his former meal, were
    </p>
    <p>
     left; on these he supped after a fashion, and long before the white owl
    </p>
    <p>
     began his rounds Felix was fast asleep on his hunter's hide from the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe. He found next morning that the island was small, only a few
    </p>
    <p>
     acres; it was well-wooded, dry, and sandy in places. He had little
    </p>
    <p>
     inclination or strength to resume his expedition; he erected a booth of
    </p>
    <p>
     branches, and resolved to stay a few days till his strength returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     By shooting wildfowl, and fishing, he fared very well, and soon
    </p>
    <p>
     recovered. In two days the discoloration of the skin had faded to an
    </p>
    <p>
     olive tint, which, too, grew fainter. The canoe lost its blackness, and
    </p>
    <p>
     became a rusty colour. By rubbing the coins he had carried away he found
    </p>
    <p>
     they were gold; part of the inscription remained, but he could not read
    </p>
    <p>
     it. The blue china-tile was less injured than the metal; after washing
    </p>
    <p>
     it, it was bright. But the diamond pleased him most; it would be a
    </p>
    <p>
     splendid present for Aurora. Never had he seen anything like it in the
    </p>
    <p>
     palaces; he believe it was twice the size of the largest possessed by
    </p>
    <p>
     any king or prince.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was as big as his finger-nail, and shone and gleamed in the sunlight,
    </p>
    <p>
     sparkling and reflecting the beams. Its value must be very great. But
    </p>
    <p>
     well he knew how dangerous it would be to exhibit it; on some pretext or
    </p>
    <p>
     other he would be thrown into prison, and the gem seized. It must be
    </p>
    <p>
     hidden with the greatest care till he could produce it in Thyma Castle,
    </p>
    <p>
     when the Baron would protect it. Felix regretted now that he had not
    </p>
    <p>
     searched further; perhaps he might have found other treasures for
    </p>
    <p>
     Aurora; the next instant he repudiated his greed, and was only thankful
    </p>
    <p>
     that he had escaped with his life. He wondered and marvelled that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     done so, it was so well known that almost all who had ventured in had
    </p>
    <p>
     perished.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reflecting on the circumstances which had accompanied his entrance to
    </p>
    <p>
     the marshes, the migration of the birds seemed almost the most singular.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were evidently flying from some apprehended danger, and that most
    </p>
    <p>
     probably would be in the air. The gale at that time, however, was
    </p>
    <p>
     blowing in a direction which would appear to ensure safety to them;
    </p>
    <p>
     into, and not out of, the poisonous marshes. Did they, then, foresee
    </p>
    <p>
     that it would change? Did they expect it to veer like a cyclone and
    </p>
    <p>
     presently blow east with the same vigour as it then blew west? That
    </p>
    <p>
     would carry the vapour from the inky waters out over the sweet Lake, and
    </p>
    <p>
     might even cause the foul water itself to temporarily encroach on the
    </p>
    <p>
     sweet. The more he thought of it, the more he felt convinced that this
    </p>
    <p>
     was the explanation; and, as a fact, the wind, after dropping, did arise
    </p>
    <p>
     again and blow from the east, though, as it happened, not with nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     the same strength. It fell, too, before long, fortunately for him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly the birds had anticipated a cyclone, and that the wind turning
    </p>
    <p>
     would carry the gases out upon them to their destruction. They had
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore hurried away, and the fishes had done the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     The velocity of the gale which had carried him into the black waters had
    </p>
    <p>
     proved his safety, by driving before it the thicker and most poisonous
    </p>
    <p>
     portion of the vapour, compressing it towards the east, so that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     entered the dreaded precincts under favourable conditions. When it
    </p>
    <p>
     dropped, while he was on the black island, he soon began to feel the
    </p>
    <p>
     effect of the gases rising imperceptibly from the soil, and had he not
    </p>
    <p>
     had the good fortune to escape so soon, no doubt he would have fallen a
    </p>
    <p>
     victim. He could not congratulate himself sufficiently upon his good
    </p>
    <p>
     fortune. The other circumstances appeared to be due to the decay of the
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient city, to the decomposition of accumulated matter, to
    </p>
    <p>
     phosphorescence and gaseous exhalations. The black rocks that crumbled
    </p>
    <p>
     at a touch were doubtless the remains of ancient buildings saturated
    </p>
    <p>
     with the dark water and vapours. Inland similar remains were white, and
    </p>
    <p>
     resembled salt.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the great explosions which occurred as he was leaving, and which
    </p>
    <p>
     sent heavy rollers after him, were not easily understood, till he
    </p>
    <p>
     remembered that in Sylvester's "Book of Natural Things" it was related
    </p>
    <p>
     that "the ancient city had been undermined with vast conduits, sewers,
    </p>
    <p>
     and tunnels, and that these communicated with the sea". It had been much
    </p>
    <p>
     disputed whether the sea did or did not still send its tides up to the
    </p>
    <p>
     site of the old quays. Felix now thought that the explosions were due to
    </p>
    <p>
     compressed air, or more probably to gases met with by the ascending
    </p>
    <p>
     tide.

    <p>
     THE SHEPHERDS
    </p>
    <p>
     For four days Felix remained on the island recovering his strength. By
    </p>
    <p>
     degrees the memory of the scenes he had witnessed grew less vivid, and
    </p>
    <p>
     his nerves regained their tone. The fifth morning he sailed again,
    </p>
    <p>
     making due south with a gentle breeze from the west, which suited the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe very well. He considered that he was now at the eastern extremity
    </p>
    <p>
     of the Lake, and that by sailing south he should presently reach the
    </p>
    <p>
     place where the shore turned to the east again. The sharp prow of the
    </p>
    <p>
     canoe cut swiftly through the waves, a light spray flew occasionally in
    </p>
    <p>
     his face, and the wind blew pleasantly. In the cloudless sky swallows
    </p>
    <p>
     and swifts were wheeling, and on the water half a dozen mallards moved
    </p>
    <p>
     aside to let him pass.
    </p>
    <p>
     About two hours after he started he encountered a mist, which came
    </p>
    <p>
     softly over the surface of the water with the wind, and in an instant
    </p>
    <p>
     shut out all view. Even the sun was scarcely visible. It was very warm,
    </p>
    <p>
     and left no moisture. In five minutes he passed through and emerged
    </p>
    <p>
     again in the bright sunlight. These dry, warm mists are frequently seen
    </p>
    <p>
     on the Lake in summer, and are believed to portend a continuance of fine
    </p>
    <p>
     weather.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix kept a good distance from the mainland, which was hilly and
    </p>
    <p>
     wooded, and with few islands. Presently he observed in the extreme
    </p>
    <p>
     distance, on his right hand, a line of mountainous hills, which he
    </p>
    <p>
     supposed to be the southern shore of the Lake, and that he was sailing
    </p>
    <p>
     into a gulf or bay. He debated with himself whether he should alter his
    </p>
    <p>
     course and work across to the mountains, or to continue to trace the
    </p>
    <p>
     shore. Unless he did trace the shore, he could scarcely say that he had
    </p>
    <p>
     circumnavigated the Lake, as he would leave this great bay unexplored.
    </p>
    <p>
     He continued, therefore, to sail directly south.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wind freshened towards noon, and the canoe flew at a great pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Twice he passed through similar mists. There were now no islands at all,
    </p>
    <p>
     but a line of low chalk cliffs marked the shore. Considering that it
    </p>
    <p>
     must be deep, and safe to do so, Felix bore in closer to look at the
    </p>
    <p>
     land. Woods ran along the hills right to the verge of the cliff, but he
    </p>
    <p>
     saw no signs of inhabitants, no smoke, boat, or house. The sound of the
    </p>
    <p>
     surf beating on the beach was audible, though the waves were not large.
    </p>
    <p>
     High over the cliff he noted a kite soaring, with forked tail, at a
    </p>
    <p>
     great height.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately afterwards he ran into another mist or vapour, thicker, if
    </p>
    <p>
     anything, and which quite obscured his view. It seemed like a great
    </p>
    <p>
     cloud on the surface of the water, and broader than those he had
    </p>
    <p>
     previously entered. Suddenly the canoe stopped with a tremendous jerk,
    </p>
    <p>
     which pitched him forward on his knees, the mast cracked, and there was
    </p>
    <p>
     a noise of splitting wood. As soon as he could get up, Felix saw, to his
    </p>
    <p>
     bitter sorrow, that the canoe had split longitudinally; the water came
    </p>
    <p>
     up through the split, and the boat was held together only by the beams
    </p>
    <p>
     of the outrigger. He had run aground on a large sharp flint embedded in
    </p>
    <p>
     a chalk floor, which had split the poplar wood of the canoe like an axe.
    </p>
    <p>
     The voyage was over, for the least strain would cause the canoe to part
    </p>
    <p>
     in two, and if she were washed off the ground she would be water-logged.
    </p>
    <p>
     In half a minute the mist passed, leaving him in the bright day,
    </p>
    <p>
     shipwrecked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix now saw that the waters were white with suspended chalk, and
    </p>
    <p>
     sounding with the paddle, found that the depth was but a few inches. He
    </p>
    <p>
     had driven at full speed on a reef. There was no danger, for the
    </p>
    <p>
     distance to the shore was hardly two hundred yards, and judging by the
    </p>
    <p>
     appearance of the water, it was shallow all the way. But his canoe, the
    </p>
    <p>
     product of so much labour, and in which he had voyaged so far, his canoe
    </p>
    <p>
     was destroyed. He could not repair her; he doubted whether it could have
    </p>
    <p>
     been done successfully even at home with Oliver to help him. He could
    </p>
    <p>
     sail no farther; there was nothing for it but to get ashore and travel
    </p>
    <p>
     on foot. If the wind rose higher, the waves would soon break clean over
    </p>
    <p>
     her, and she would go to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a heavy heart, Felix took his paddle and stepped overboard. Feeling
    </p>
    <p>
     with the paddle, he plumbed the depth in front of him, and, as he
    </p>
    <p>
     expected, walked all the way to the shore, no deeper than his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was fortunate, as it enabled him to convey his things to land
    </p>
    <p>
     without loss. He wrapped up the tools and manuscripts in one of his
    </p>
    <p>
     hunter's hides. When the whole cargo was landed, he sat down sorrowfully
    </p>
    <p>
     at the foot of the cliff, and looked out at the broken mast and sail,
    </p>
    <p>
     still flapping uselessly in the breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a long time before he recovered himself, and set to work
    </p>
    <p>
     mechanically to bury the crossbow, hunter's hides, tools, and
    </p>
    <p>
     manuscripts, under a heap of pebbles. As the cliff, though low, was
    </p>
    <p>
     perpendicular, he could not scale it, else he would have preferred to
    </p>
    <p>
     conceal them in the woods above. To pile pebbles over them was the best
    </p>
    <p>
     he could do for the present; he intended to return for them when he
    </p>
    <p>
     discovered a path up the cliff. He then started, taking only his bow and
    </p>
    <p>
     arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no such path was to be found; he walked on and on till weary, and
    </p>
    <p>
     still the cliff ran like a wall on his left hand. After an hour's rest,
    </p>
    <p>
     he started again; and, as the sun was declining, came suddenly to a gap
    </p>
    <p>
     in the cliff, where a grassy sward came down to the shore. It was now
    </p>
    <p>
     too late, and he was too weary, to think of returning for his things
    </p>
    <p>
     that evening. He made a scanty meal, and endeavoured to rest. But the
    </p>
    <p>
     excitement of losing the canoe, the long march since, the lack of good
    </p>
    <p>
     food, all tended to render him restless. Weary, he could not rest, nor
    </p>
    <p>
     move farther. The time passed slowly, the sun sank, the wind ceased;
    </p>
    <p>
     after an interminable time the stars appeared, and still he could not
    </p>
    <p>
     sleep. He had chosen a spot under an oak on the green slope. The night
    </p>
    <p>
     was warm, and even sultry, so that he did not miss his covering, but
    </p>
    <p>
     there was no rest in him. Towards the dawn, which comes very early at
    </p>
    <p>
     that season, he at last slept, with his back to the tree. He awoke with
    </p>
    <p>
     a start in broad daylight, to see a man standing in front of him armed
    </p>
    <p>
     with a long spear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix sprang to his feet, instinctively feeling for his hunting-knife;
    </p>
    <p>
     but he saw in an instant that no injury was meant, for the man was
    </p>
    <p>
     leaning on the shaft of his weapon, and, of course, could, if so he had
    </p>
    <p>
     wished, have run him through while sleeping. They looked at each other
    </p>
    <p>
     for a moment. The stranger was clad in a tunic, and wore a hat of
    </p>
    <p>
     plaited straw. He was very tall and strongly built; his single weapon, a
    </p>
    <p>
     spear of twice his own length. His beard came down on his chest. He
    </p>
    <p>
     spoke to Felix in a dialect the latter did not understand. Felix held
    </p>
    <p>
     out his hand as a token of amity, which the other took. He spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix, on his part, tried to explain his shipwreck, when a word the
    </p>
    <p>
     stranger uttered recalled to Felix's memory the peculiar dialect used by
    </p>
    <p>
     the shepherd race on the hills in the neighbourhood of his home.
    </p>
    <p>
     He spoke in this dialect, which the stranger in part at least
    </p>
    <p>
     understood, and the sound of which at once rendered him more friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
     By degrees they comprehended each other's meaning the easier, as the
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherd had come the same way and had seen the wreck of the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix learned that the shepherd was a scout sent on ahead to see that
    </p>
    <p>
     the road was clear of enemies. His tribe were on the march with their
    </p>
    <p>
     flocks, and to avoid the steep woods and hills which there blocked their
    </p>
    <p>
     course, they had followed the level and open beach at the foot of the
    </p>
    <p>
     cliff, aware, of course, of the gap which Felix had found. While they
    </p>
    <p>
     were talking, Felix saw the cloud of dust raised by the sheep as the
    </p>
    <p>
     flocks wound round a jutting buttress of cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
     His friend explained that they marched in the night and early morning to
    </p>
    <p>
     avoid the heat of the day. Their proposed halting-place was close at
    </p>
    <p>
     hand; he must go on and see that all was clear. Felix accompanied him,
    </p>
    <p>
     and found within the wood at the summit a grassy coombe, where a spring
    </p>
    <p>
     rose. The shepherd threw down his spear, and began to dam up the channel
    </p>
    <p>
     of the spring with stones, flints, and sods of earth, in order to form a
    </p>
    <p>
     pool at which the sheep might drink. Felix assisted him, and the water
    </p>
    <p>
     speedily began to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
     The flocks were not allowed to rush tumultuously to the water; they came
    </p>
    <p>
     in about fifty at a time, each division with its shepherds and their
    </p>
    <p>
     dogs, so that confusion was avoided and all had their share. There were
    </p>
    <p>
     about twenty of these divisions, besides eighty cows and a few goats.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had no horses; their baggage came on the backs of asses.
    </p>
    <p>
     After the whole of the flocks and herds had been watered several fires
    </p>
    <p>
     were lit by the women, who in stature and hardihood scarcely differed
    </p>
    <p>
     from the men. Not till this work was over did the others gather about
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix to hear his story. Finding that he was hungry they ran to the
    </p>
    <p>
     baggage for food, and pressed on him a little dark bread, plentiful
    </p>
    <p>
     cheese and butter, dried tongue, and horns of mead. He could not devour
    </p>
    <p>
     a fiftieth part of what these hospitable people brought him. Having
    </p>
    <p>
     nothing else to give them, he took from his pocket one of the gold coins
    </p>
    <p>
     he had brought from the site of the ancient city, and offered it.
    </p>
    <p>
     They laughed, and made him understand that it was of no value to them;
    </p>
    <p>
     but they passed it from hand to hand, and he noticed that they began to
    </p>
    <p>
     look at him curiously. From its blackened appearance they conjectured
    </p>
    <p>
     whence he had obtained it; one, too, pointed to his shoes, which were
    </p>
    <p>
     still blackened, and appeared to have been scorched. The whole camp now
    </p>
    <p>
     pressed on him, their wonder and interest rising to a great height. With
    </p>
    <p>
     some trouble Felix described his journey over the site of the ancient
    </p>
    <p>
     city, interrupted with constant exclamations, questions, and excited
    </p>
    <p>
     conversation. He told them everything, except about the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their manner towards him perceptibly altered. From the first they had
    </p>
    <p>
     been hospitable; they now became respectful, and even reverent. The
    </p>
    <p>
     elders and their chief, not to be distinguished by dress or ornament
    </p>
    <p>
     from the rest, treated him with ceremony and marked deference. The
    </p>
    <p>
     children were brought to see and even to touch him. So great was their
    </p>
    <p>
     amazement that any one should have escaped from these pestilential
    </p>
    <p>
     vapours, that they attributed it to divine interposition, and looked
    </p>
    <p>
     upon him with some of the awe of superstition. He was asked to stay with
    </p>
    <p>
     them altogether, and to take command of the tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
     The latter Felix declined; to stay with them for awhile, at least, he
    </p>
    <p>
     was, of course, willing enough. He mentioned his hidden possessions, and
    </p>
    <p>
     got up to return for them, but they would not permit him. Two men
    </p>
    <p>
     started at once. He gave them the bearings of the spot, and they had not
    </p>
    <p>
     the least doubt but that they should find it, especially as, the wind
    </p>
    <p>
     being still, the canoe would not yet have broken up, and would guide
    </p>
    <p>
     them. The tribe remained in the green coombe the whole day, resting from
    </p>
    <p>
     their long journey. They wearied Felix with questions, still he answered
    </p>
    <p>
     them as copiously as he could; he felt too grateful for their kindness
    </p>
    <p>
     not to satisfy them. His bow was handled, his arrows carried about so
    </p>
    <p>
     that the quiver for the time was empty, and the arrows scattered in
    </p>
    <p>
     twenty hands. He astonished them by exhibiting his skill with the
    </p>
    <p>
     weapon, striking a tree with an arrow at nearly three hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though familiar, of course, with the bow, they had never seen shooting
    </p>
    <p>
     like that, nor, indeed, any archery except at short quarters. They had
    </p>
    <p>
     no other arms themselves but spears and knives. Seeing one of the women
    </p>
    <p>
     cutting the boughs from a fallen tree, dead and dry, and, therefore,
    </p>
    <p>
     preferable for fuel, Felix naturally went to help her, and, taking the
    </p>
    <p>
     axe, soon made a bundle, which he carried for her. It was his duty as a
    </p>
    <p>
     noble to see than no woman, not a slave, laboured; he had been bred in
    </p>
    <p>
     that idea, and would have felt disgraced had he permitted it. The women
    </p>
    <p>
     looked on with astonishment, for in these rude tribes the labour of the
    </p>
    <p>
     women was considered valuable and appraised like that of a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without any conscious design, Felix thus in one day conciliated and won
    </p>
    <p>
     the regard of the two most powerful parties in the camp, the chief and
    </p>
    <p>
     the women. By his refusing the command the chief was flattered, and his
    </p>
    <p>
     possible hostility prevented. The act of cutting the wood and carrying
    </p>
    <p>
     the bundle gave him the hearts of the women. They did not, indeed, think
    </p>
    <p>
     their labour in any degree oppressive; still, to be relieved of it was
    </p>
    <p>
     pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two men who had gone for Felix's buried treasure did not return till
    </p>
    <p>
     breakfast next morning. They stepped into the camp, each with his spear
    </p>
    <p>
     reddened and dripping with fresh blood. Felix no sooner saw the blood
    </p>
    <p>
     than he fainted. He quickly recovered, but he could not endure the sight
    </p>
    <p>
     of the spears, which were removed and hidden from his view. He had seen
    </p>
    <p>
     blood enough spilt at the siege of Iwis, but this came upon him in all
    </p>
    <p>
     its horror unrelieved by the excitement of war.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two shepherds had been dogged by gipsies, and had been obliged to
    </p>
    <p>
     make a round to escape. They took their revenge by climbing into trees,
    </p>
    <p>
     and as their pursuers passed under thrust them through with their long
    </p>
    <p>
     spears. The shepherds, like all their related tribes, had been at feud
    </p>
    <p>
     with the gipsies for many generations. The gipsies followed them to and
    </p>
    <p>
     from their pastures, cut off stragglers, destroyed or stole their sheep
    </p>
    <p>
     and cattle, and now and then overwhelmed a whole tribe. Of late the
    </p>
    <p>
     contest had become more sanguinary and almost ceaseless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mounted on swift, though small, horses, the gipsies had the advantage of
    </p>
    <p>
     the shepherds. On the other hand, the shepherds, being men of great
    </p>
    <p>
     stature and strength, could not be carried away by a rush if they had
    </p>
    <p>
     time to form a circle, as was their custom of battle. They lost many men
    </p>
    <p>
     by the javelins thrown by the gipsies, who rode up to the edge of the
    </p>
    <p>
     circle, cast their darts, and retreated. If the shepherds left their
    </p>
    <p>
     circle they were easily ridden over; while they maintained formation
    </p>
    <p>
     they lost individuals, but saved the mass. Battles were of rare
    </p>
    <p>
     occurrence; the gipsies watched for opportunities and executed raids,
    </p>
    <p>
     the shepherds retaliated, and thus the endless war continued. The
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherds invariably posted sentinels, and sent forward scouts to
    </p>
    <p>
     ascertain if the way were clear. Accustomed to the horrid scenes of war
    </p>
    <p>
     from childhood, they could not understand Felix's sensitiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
     They laughed, and then petted him like a spoilt child. This galled him
    </p>
    <p>
     exceedingly; he felt humiliated, and eager to reassert his manhood. He
    </p>
    <p>
     was willing to stay with them there for awhile, nothing would have
    </p>
    <p>
     induced him to leave them now till he had vindicated himself in their
    </p>
    <p>
     sight. The incident happened soon after sunrise, which is very early at
    </p>
    <p>
     the end of June. The camp had only waited for the return of these men,
    </p>
    <p>
     and on their appearance began to move. The march that morning was not a
    </p>
    <p>
     long one, as the sky was clear and the heat soon wearied the flocks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix accompanied the scout in advance, armed with his bow, eager to
    </p>
    <p>
     encounter the gipsies.

    <p>
     BOW AND ARROW
    </p>
    <p>
     Three mornings the shepherds marched in the same manner, when they came
    </p>
    <p>
     in view of a range of hills so high that to Felix they appeared
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains. The home of the tribe was in these hills, and once there they
    </p>
    <p>
     were comparatively safe from attack. In early spring when the herbage on
    </p>
    <p>
     the downs was scarce, the flocks moved to the meadowlike lands far in
    </p>
    <p>
     the valleys; in summer they returned to the hills; in autumn they went
    </p>
    <p>
     to the vales again. Soon after noon on the third day the scouts reported
    </p>
    <p>
     that a large body of gipsies were moving in a direction which would cut
    </p>
    <p>
     off their course to the hills on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     The chief held a council, and it was determined that a forced march
    </p>
    <p>
     should be made at once by another route, more to the left, and it was
    </p>
    <p>
     thought that in this way they might reach the base of the slopes by
    </p>
    <p>
     evening. The distance was not great, and could easily have been
    </p>
    <p>
     traversed by the men; the flocks and herds, however, could not be
    </p>
    <p>
     hurried much. A messenger was despatched to the hills for assistance,
    </p>
    <p>
     and the march began. It was a tedious movement. Felix was wearied, and
    </p>
    <p>
     walked in a drowsy state. Towards six o'clock, as he guessed, the trees
    </p>
    <p>
     began to thin, and the column reached the first slopes of the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here about thirty shepherds joined them, a contingent from the nearest
    </p>
    <p>
     camp. It was considered that the danger was now past, and that the
    </p>
    <p>
     gipsies would not attack them on the hill; but it was a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
     A large body almost immediately appeared, coming along the slope on the
    </p>
    <p>
     right, not less than two hundred; and from their open movements and
    </p>
    <p>
     numbers it was evident that they intended battle. The flocks and herds
    </p>
    <p>
     were driven hastily into a coombe, or narrow valley, and there left to
    </p>
    <p>
     their fate. All the armed men formed in a circle; the women occupied the
    </p>
    <p>
     centre. Felix took his stand outside the circle by a gnarled and decayed
    </p>
    <p>
     oak. There was just there a slight rise in the ground, which he knew
    </p>
    <p>
     would give him some advantage in discharging his arrows, and would also
    </p>
    <p>
     allow him a clear view. His friends earnestly entreated him to enter the
    </p>
    <p>
     circle, and even sought to bring him within it by force, till he
    </p>
    <p>
     explained to them that he could not shoot if so surrounded, and promised
    </p>
    <p>
     if the gipsies charged to rush inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix unslung his quiver, and placed it on the ground before him; a
    </p>
    <p>
     second quiver he put beside it; four or five arrows he stuck upright in
    </p>
    <p>
     the sward, so that he could catch hold of them quickly; two arrows he
    </p>
    <p>
     held in his left hand, another he fitted to the string. Thus prepared,
    </p>
    <p>
     he watched the gipsies advance. They came walking their short wiry
    </p>
    <p>
     horses to within half a mile, when they began to trot down the slope;
    </p>
    <p>
     they could not surround the shepherds because of the steep-sided coombe
    </p>
    <p>
     and some brushwood, and could advance only on two fronts. Felix rapidly
    </p>
    <p>
     became so excited that his sight was affected, and his head whirled. His
    </p>
    <p>
     heart beat with such speed that his breath seemed going. His limbs
    </p>
    <p>
     tottered, and he dreaded lest he should faint.
    </p>
    <p>
     His intensely nervous organization, strung up to its highest pitch,
    </p>
    <p>
     shook him in its grasp, and his will was powerless to control it. He
    </p>
    <p>
     felt that he should disgrace himself once more before these rugged but
    </p>
    <p>
     brave shepherds, who betrayed not the slightest symptom of agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one hour of Oliver's calm courage and utter absence of nervousness
    </p>
    <p>
     he would have given years of his life. His friends in the circle
    </p>
    <p>
     observed his agitation, and renewed their entreaties to him to come
    </p>
    <p>
     inside it. This only was needed to complete his discomfiture. He lost
    </p>
    <p>
     his head altogether; he saw nothing but a confused mass of yellow and
    </p>
    <p>
     red rushing towards him, for each of the gipsies wore a yellow or red
    </p>
    <p>
     scarf, some about the body, some over the shoulder, others round the
    </p>
    <p>
     head. They were now within three hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
     A murmur from the shepherd spearmen. Felix had discharged an arrow. It
    </p>
    <p>
     stuck in the ground about twenty paces from him. He shot again; it flew
    </p>
    <p>
     wild and quivering, and dropped harmlessly. Another murmur; they
    </p>
    <p>
     expressed to each other their contempt for the bow. This immediately
    </p>
    <p>
     restored Felix; he forgot the enemy as an enemy, he forgot himself; he
    </p>
    <p>
     thought only of his skill as an archer, now in question. Pride upheld
    </p>
    <p>
     him. The third arrow he fitted properly to the string, he planted his
    </p>
    <p>
     left foot slightly in advance, and looked steadfastly at the horsemen
    </p>
    <p>
     before he drew his bow.
    </p>
    <p>
     At a distance of one hundred and fifty yards they had paused, and were
    </p>
    <p>
     widening out so as to advance in loose open rank and allow each man to
    </p>
    <p>
     throw his javelin. They shouted; the spearmen in the circle replied, and
    </p>
    <p>
     levelled their spears. Felix fixed his eye on one of the gipsies who was
    </p>
    <p>
     ordering and marshalling the rest, a chief. He drew the arrow swiftly
    </p>
    <p>
     but quietly, the string hummed, the pliant yew obeyed, and the long
    </p>
    <p>
     arrow shot forward in a steady swift flight like a line of gossamer
    </p>
    <p>
     drawn through the air. It missed the chief, but pierced the horse he
    </p>
    <p>
     rode just in front of the rider's thigh. The maddened horse reared and
    </p>
    <p>
     fell backwards on his rider.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spearmen shouted. Before the sound could leave their lips another
    </p>
    <p>
     arrow had sped; a gipsy threw up his arms with a shriek; the arrow had
    </p>
    <p>
     gone through his body. A third, a fourth, a fifth--six gipsies rolled on
    </p>
    <p>
     the sward. Shout upon shout rent the air from the spearmen. Utterly
    </p>
    <p>
     unused to this mode of fighting, the gipsies fell back. Still the fatal
    </p>
    <p>
     arrows pursued them, and ere they were out of range three others fell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the rage of battle burned in Felix; his eyes gleamed, his lips were
    </p>
    <p>
     open, his nostrils wide like a horse running a race. He shouted to the
    </p>
    <p>
     spearmen to follow him, and snatching up his quiver ran forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gathered together in a group, the gipsy band consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix ran at full speed; swift of foot, he left the heavy spearmen
    </p>
    <p>
     behind. Alone he approached the horsemen; all the Aquila courage was up
    </p>
    <p>
     within him. He kept the higher ground as he ran, and stopped suddenly on
    </p>
    <p>
     a little knoll or tumulus. His arrow flew, a gipsy fell. Again, and a
    </p>
    <p>
     third. Their anger gave them fresh courage; to be repulsed by one only!
    </p>
    <p>
     Twenty of them started to charge and run him down. The keen arrows flew
    </p>
    <p>
     faster than their horses' feet. Now the horse and now the man met those
    </p>
    <p>
     sharp points. Six fell; the rest returned. The shepherds came running;
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix ordered them to charge the gipsies. His success gave him
    </p>
    <p>
     authority; they obeyed; and as they charged, he shot nine more arrows;
    </p>
    <p>
     nine more deadly wounds. Suddenly the gipsy band turned and fled into
    </p>
    <p>
     the brushwood on the lower slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Breathless, Felix sat down on the knoll, and the spearmen swarmed around
    </p>
    <p>
     him. Hardly had they begun to speak to him than there was a shout, and
    </p>
    <p>
     they saw a body of shepherds descending the hill. There were three
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred of them; warned by the messenger, the whole country had risen to
    </p>
    <p>
     repel the gipsies. Too late to join in the fight, they had seen the last
    </p>
    <p>
     of it. They examined the field. There were ten dead and six wounded, who
    </p>
    <p>
     were taken prisoners; the rest escaped, though hurt. In many cases the
    </p>
    <p>
     arrow had gone clean through the body. Then, for the first time, they
    </p>
    <p>
     understood the immense power of the yew bow in strong and skilful hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix was overwhelmed; they almost crushed him with their attentions;
    </p>
    <p>
     the women fell at his feet and kissed them. But the archer could
    </p>
    <p>
     scarcely reply; his intense nervous excitement had left him weak and
    </p>
    <p>
     almost faint; his one idea was to rest. As he walked back to the camp
    </p>
    <p>
     between the chiefs of the shepherd spearmen, his eyes closed, his limbs
    </p>
    <p>
     tottered, and they had to support him. At the camp he threw himself on
    </p>
    <p>
     the sward, under the gnarled oak, and was instantly fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately the camp was stilled, not to disturb him.
    </p>
    <p>
     His adventures in the marshes of the buried city, his canoe, his
    </p>
    <p>
     archery, were talked of the livelong night. Next morning the camp set
    </p>
    <p>
     out for their home in the mountains, and he was escorted by nearly four
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred spearmen. They had saved for him the ornaments of the gipsies
    </p>
    <p>
     who had fallen, golden earrings and nose-rings. He gave them to the
    </p>
    <p>
     women, except one, a finger-ring, set with turquoise, and evidently of
    </p>
    <p>
     ancient make, which he kept for Aurora. Two marches brought them to the
    </p>
    <p>
     home of the tribe, where the rest of the spearmen left them. The place
    </p>
    <p>
     was called Wolfstead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix saw at once how easily this spot might be fortified. There was a
    </p>
    <p>
     deep and narrow valley like a groove or green trench opening to the
    </p>
    <p>
     south. At the upper end of the valley rose a hill, not very high, but
    </p>
    <p>
     steep, narrow at the ridge, and steep again on the other side. Over it
    </p>
    <p>
     was a broad, wooded, and beautiful vale; beyond that again the higher
    </p>
    <p>
     mountains. Towards the foot of the narrow ridge here, there was a
    </p>
    <p>
     succession of chalk cliffs, so that to climb up on that side in the face
    </p>
    <p>
     of opposition would be extremely difficult. In the gorge of the enclosed
    </p>
    <p>
     narrow valley a spring rose. The shepherds had formed eight pools, one
    </p>
    <p>
     after the other, water being of great importance to them; and farther
    </p>
    <p>
     down, where the valley opened, there were forty or fifty acres of
    </p>
    <p>
     irrigated meadow. The spring then ran into a considerable brook, across
    </p>
    <p>
     which was the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix's idea was to run a palisade along the margin of the brook, and up
    </p>
    <p>
     both sides of the valley to the ridge. There he would build a fort. The
    </p>
    <p>
     edges of the chalk cliffs he would connect with a palisade or a wall,
    </p>
    <p>
     and so form a complete enclosure. He mentioned his scheme to the
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherds; they did not greatly care for it, as they had always been
    </p>
    <p>
     secure without it, the rugged nature of the country not permitting
    </p>
    <p>
     horsemen to penetrate. But they were so completely under his influence
    </p>
    <p>
     that to please him they set about the work. He had to show them how to
    </p>
    <p>
     make a palisade; they had never seen one, and he made the first part of
    </p>
    <p>
     it himself. At building a wall with loose stones, without mortar, the
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherds were skilful; the wall along the verge of the cliffs was soon
    </p>
    <p>
     up, and so was the fort on the top of the ridge. The fort consisted
    </p>
    <p>
     merely of a circular wall, breast high, with embrasures or
    </p>
    <p>
     crenellations.
    </p>
    <p>
     When this was finished, Felix had a sense of mastership, for in this
    </p>
    <p>
     fort he felt as if he could rule the whole country. From day to day
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherds came from the more distant parts to see the famous archer, and
    </p>
    <p>
     to admire the enclosure. Though the idea of it had never occurred to
    </p>
    <p>
     them, now they saw it they fully understood its advantages, and two
    </p>
    <p>
     other chiefs began to erect similar forts and palisades.

     CHAPTER XXVII
    </head>
    <p>
     SURPRISED
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix was now anxious to continue his journey, yet he did not like to
    </p>
    <p>
     leave the shepherds, with whom his life was so pleasant. As usual, when
    </p>
    <p>
     deliberating, he wandered about the hills, and then into the forest. The
    </p>
    <p>
     shepherds at first insisted on at least two of their number accompanying
    </p>
    <p>
     him; they were fearful lest the gipsies should seize him, or a Bushman
    </p>
    <p>
     assassinate him. This company was irksome to Felix. In time he convinced
    </p>
    <p>
     them that he was a much better hunter than any of the tribe, and they
    </p>
    <p>
     permitted him to roam alone. During one of these excursions into the
    </p>
    <p>
     forest he discovered a beautiful lake. He looked down on the water from
    </p>
    <p>
     the summit of one of the green mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, he thought, half a mile across, and the opposite shore was open
    </p>
    <p>
     woodland, grassy and meadow-like, and dotted with fine old oaks. By
    </p>
    <p>
     degrees these closed together, and the forest succeeded; beyond it
    </p>
    <p>
     again, at a distance of two miles, were green hills. A little clearing
    </p>
    <p>
     only was wanted to make the place fit for a castle and enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through the grass-land opposite he traced the course of a large brook
    </p>
    <p>
     down to the lake; another entered it on the right, and the lake
    </p>
    <p>
     gradually narrowed to a river on his left. Could he erect a tower there,
    </p>
    <p>
     and bring Aurora to it, how happy he would be! A more beautiful spot he
    </p>
    <p>
     had never seen, nor one more suited for every purpose in life.
    </p>
    <p>
     He followed the course of the stream which left the lake, every now and
    </p>
    <p>
     then disturbing wild goats from the cliffs, and twice he saw deer under
    </p>
    <p>
     the oaks across it. On rounding a spur of down he saw that the river
    </p>
    <p>
     debouched into a much wider lake, which he conjectured must be the Sweet
    </p>
    <p>
     Waters. He went on till he reached the mouth of the river, and had then
    </p>
    <p>
     no doubt that he was standing once more on the shore of the Sweet Water
    </p>
    <p>
     sea. On this, the southern side, the banks were low; on the other, a
    </p>
    <p>
     steep chalky cliff almost overhung the river, and jutted out into the
    </p>
    <p>
     lake, curving somewhat towards him. A fort on that cliff would command
    </p>
    <p>
     the entrance to the river; the cliff was a natural breakwater, so that
    </p>
    <p>
     there was a haven at its base. The river appeared broad and deep enough
    </p>
    <p>
     for navigation, so that vessels could pass from the great Lake to the
    </p>
    <p>
     inland water; about six or seven miles, he supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix was much taken with this spot; the beauty of the inland lake, the
    </p>
    <p>
     evident richness of the soil, the river communicating with the great
    </p>
    <p>
     Lake, the cliff commanding its entrance; never, in all his wanderings,
    </p>
    <p>
     had he seen a district so well suited for a settlement and the founding
    </p>
    <p>
     of a city. If he had but a thousand men! How soon he would bring Aurora
    </p>
    <p>
     there, and build a tower, and erect a palisade! So occupied was he with
    </p>
    <p>
     the thought that he returned the whole distance to the spot where he had
    </p>
    <p>
     made the discovery. There he remained a long time, designing it all in
    </p>
    <p>
     his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tower he would build yonder, three-quarters of a mile, perhaps a
    </p>
    <p>
     mile, inland from the opposite shore, on a green knoll, at the base of
    </p>
    <p>
     which the brook flowed. It would be even more pleasant there than on the
    </p>
    <p>
     shore of the lake. The forest he would clear back a little, and put up a
    </p>
    <p>
     stout palisade, enclosing at least three miles of grassy land. By the
    </p>
    <p>
     shore of the lake he would build his town, so that his vessels might be
    </p>
    <p>
     able to go forth into the great Sweet Water sea. So strongly did
    </p>
    <p>
     imagination hold him that he did not observe how near it was to sunset,
    </p>
    <p>
     nor did he remark the threatening aspect of the sky. Thunder awoke him
    </p>
    <p>
     from his dream; he looked, and saw a storm rapidly coming from the
    </p>
    <p>
     north-east.
    </p>
    <p>
     He descended the hill, and sheltered himself as well as possible among
    </p>
    <p>
     some thick fir-trees. After the lightning, the rain poured so heavily
    </p>
    <p>
     that it penetrated the branches, and he unstrung his bow and placed the
    </p>
    <p>
     string in his pocket, that it might not become wet. Instantly there was
    </p>
    <p>
     a whoop on either side, and two gipsies darted from the undergrowth
    </p>
    <p>
     towards him. While the terrible bow was bent they had followed him,
    </p>
    <p>
     tracking his footsteps; the moment he unstrung the bow, they rushed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix crushed through between the firs, by main force getting through,
    </p>
    <p>
     but only opening a passage for them to follow. They could easily have
    </p>
    <p>
     thrust their darts through him, but their object was to take him alive,
    </p>
    <p>
     and gratify the revenge of the tribes with torture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix doubled from the firs, and made towards the far-distant camp; but
    </p>
    <p>
     he was faced by three more gipsies. He turned again and made for the
    </p>
    <p>
     steep hill he had descended. With all his strength he raced up it; his
    </p>
    <p>
     lightness of foot carried him in advance, and he reached the summit a
    </p>
    <p>
     hundred yards ahead; but he knew he must be overtaken presently, unless
    </p>
    <p>
     he could hit upon some stratagem. In the instant that he paused to
    </p>
    <p>
     breathe on the summit a thought struck him. Like the wind he raced along
    </p>
    <p>
     the ridge, making for the great Sweet Water, the same path he had
    </p>
    <p>
     followed in the morning. Once on the ridge the five pursuers shouted;
    </p>
    <p>
     they knew they should have him now there were no more hills to breast.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not so easy as they imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix was in splendid training; he kept his lead, and even drew a little
    </p>
    <p>
     on them. Still he knew in time he must succumb, just as the stag, though
    </p>
    <p>
     swifter of foot, ultimately succumbs to the hounds. They would track him
    </p>
    <p>
     till they had him. If only he could gain enough to have time to string
    </p>
    <p>
     and bend his bow! But with all his efforts he could not get away more
    </p>
    <p>
     than the hundred yards, and that was not far enough. It could be
    </p>
    <p>
     traversed in ten seconds, they would have him before he could string it
    </p>
    <p>
     and fit an arrow. If only he had been fresh as in the morning! But he
    </p>
    <p>
     had had a long walk during the day and not much food. He knew that his
    </p>
    <p>
     burst of speed must soon slacken, but he had a stratagem yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Keeping along the ridge till he reached the place where the lake
    </p>
    <p>
     narrowed to the river, suddenly he rushed down the hill towards the
    </p>
    <p>
     water. The edge was encumbered with brushwood and fallen trees; he
    </p>
    <p>
     scrambled over and through anyhow; he tore a path through the bushes and
    </p>
    <p>
     plunged in. But his jacket caught in a branch; he had his knife out and
    </p>
    <p>
     cut off the shred of cloth. Then with the bow and knife in one hand he
    </p>
    <p>
     struck out for the opposite shore. His hope was that the gipsies, being
    </p>
    <p>
     horsemen, and passing all their lives on their horses, might not know
    </p>
    <p>
     how to swim. His conjecture was right; they stopped on the brink, and
    </p>
    <p>
     yelled their loudest. When he had passed the middle of the slow stream
    </p>
    <p>
     their rage rose to a shriek, startling a heron far down the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix reached the opposite shore in safety, but the bow-string was now
    </p>
    <p>
     wet and useless. He struck off at once straight across the grass-lands,
    </p>
    <p>
     past the oaks he had admired, past the green knoll where in imagination
    </p>
    <p>
     he had built his castle and brought Aurora, through the brook, which he
    </p>
    <p>
     found was larger than it appeared at a distance, and required two or
    </p>
    <p>
     three strokes to cross. A few more paces and the forest sheltered him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the trees he rested, and considered what course to pursue. The
    </p>
    <p>
     gipsies would expect him to endeavour to regain his friends, and would
    </p>
    <p>
     watch to cut off his return. Felix determined to make, instead, for
    </p>
    <p>
     another camp farther east, and to get even there by a detour.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bitterly he reproached himself for his folly in leaving the camp,
    </p>
    <p>
     knowing that gipsies were about, with no other weapon than the bow. The
    </p>
    <p>
     knife at his belt was practically no weapon at all, useful only in the
    </p>
    <p>
     last extremity. Had he a short sword, or javelin, he would have faced
    </p>
    <p>
     the two gipsies who first sprang towards him. Worse than this was the
    </p>
    <p>
     folly of wandering without the least precaution into a territory at that
    </p>
    <p>
     time full of gipsies, who had every reason to desire his capture. If he
    </p>
    <p>
     had used the ordinary precautions of woodcraft, he would have noticed
    </p>
    <p>
     their traces, and he would not have exposed himself in full view on the
    </p>
    <p>
     ridges of the hills, where a man was visible for miles. If he perished
    </p>
    <p>
     through his carelessness, how bitter it would be! To lose Aurora by the
    </p>
    <p>
     merest folly would, indeed, be humiliating.
    </p>
    <p>
     He braced himself to the journey before him, and set off at a good
    </p>
    <p>
     swinging hunter's pace, as it is called, that is, a pace rather more
    </p>
    <p>
     than a walk and less than a run, with the limbs somewhat bent, and long
    </p>
    <p>
     springy steps. The forest was in the worst possible condition for
    </p>
    <p>
     movement; the rain had damped the fern and undergrowth, and every branch
    </p>
    <p>
     showered raindrops upon him. It was now past sunset and the dusk was
    </p>
    <p>
     increasing; this he welcomed as hiding him. He travelled on till nearly
    </p>
    <p>
     dawn, and then, turning to the right, swept round, and regained the line
    </p>
    <p>
     of the mountainous hills after sunrise. There he rested, and reached a
    </p>
    <p>
     camp about nine in the morning, having walked altogether since the
    </p>
    <p>
     preceding morning fully fifty miles. This camp was about fifteen miles
    </p>
    <p>
     distant from that of his friends; the shepherds knew him, and one of
    </p>
    <p>
     them started with the news of his safety. In the afternoon ten of his
    </p>
    <p>
     friends came over to see him, and to reproach him.
    </p>
    <p>
     His weariness was so great that for three days he scarcely moved from
    </p>
    <p>
     the hut, during which time the weather was wet and stormy, as is often
    </p>
    <p>
     the case in summer after a thunderstorm. On the fourth morning it was
    </p>
    <p>
     fine, and Felix, now quite restored to his usual strength, went out with
    </p>
    <p>
     the shepherds. He found some of them engaged in throwing up a heap of
    </p>
    <p>
     stones, flint, and chalk lumps near an oak-tree in a plain at the foot
    </p>
    <p>
     of the hill. They told him that during the thunderstorm two cows and ten
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep had been killed there by lightning, which had scarcely injured the
    </p>
    <p>
     oak.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was their custom to pile up a heap of stones wherever such an event
    </p>
    <p>
     occurred, to warn others from staying themselves, or allowing their
    </p>
    <p>
     sheep or cattle to stay, near the spot in thunder, as it was observed
    </p>
    <p>
     that where lightning struck once it was sure to strike again, sooner or
    </p>
    <p>
     later. "Then," said Felix, "you may be sure there is water there!" He
    </p>
    <p>
     knew from his study of the knowledge of the ancients that lightning
    </p>
    <p>
     frequently leaped from trees or buildings to concealed water, but he had
    </p>
    <p>
     no intention of indicating water in that particular spot. He meant the
    </p>
    <p>
     remark in a general sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the shepherds, ever desirous of water, and looking on Felix as a
    </p>
    <p>
     being of a different order to themselves, took his casual observation in
    </p>
    <p>
     its literal sense. They brought their tools and dug, and, as it chanced,
    </p>
    <p>
     found a copious spring. The water gushed forth and formed a streamlet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon this the whole tribe gathered, and they saluted Felix as one almost
    </p>
    <p>
     divine. It was in vain that he endeavoured to repel this homage, and to
    </p>
    <p>
     explain the reason of his remark, and that it was only in a general way
    </p>
    <p>
     that he intended it. Facts were too strong for him. They had heard his
    </p>
    <p>
     words, which they considered an inspiration, and there was the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was no use; there was the spring, the very thing they most wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perforce Felix was invested with attributes beyond nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     The report spread; his own old friends came in a crowd to see the new
    </p>
    <p>
     spring, others journeyed from afar. In a week, Felix having meanwhile
    </p>
    <p>
     returned to Wolfstead, his fame had for the second time spread all over
    </p>
    <p>
     the district. Some came a hundred miles to see him. Nothing he could say
    </p>
    <p>
     was listened to; these simple, straightforward people understood nothing
    </p>
    <p>
     but facts, and the defeat of the gipsies and the discovery of the spring
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to them little less than supernatural. Besides which, in
    </p>
    <p>
     innumerable little ways Felix's superior knowledge had told upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
     His very manners spoke of high training. His persuasive voice won them.
    </p>
    <p>
     His constructive skill and power of planning, as shown in the palisades
    </p>
    <p>
     and enclosure, showed a grasp of circumstances new to them. This was a
    </p>
    <p>
     man such as they had never before seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     They began to bring him disputes to settle; he shrank from this position
    </p>
    <p>
     of judge, but it was useless to struggle; they would wait as long as he
    </p>
    <p>
     liked, but his decision they would have, and no other. Next came the
    </p>
    <p>
     sick begging to be cured. Here Felix was firm; he would not attempt to
    </p>
    <p>
     be a physician, and they went away. But, unfortunately, it happened that
    </p>
    <p>
     he let out his knowledge of plants, and back they came. Felix did not
    </p>
    <p>
     know what course to pursue; if by chance he did any one good, crowds
    </p>
    <p>
     would beset him; if injury resulted, perhaps he would be assassinated.
    </p>
    <p>
     This fear was quite unfounded; he really had not the smallest idea of
    </p>
    <p>
     how high he stood in their estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
     After much consideration, Felix hit upon a method which would save him
    </p>
    <p>
     from many inconveniences. He announced his intention of forming a
    </p>
    <p>
     herb-garden in which to grow the best kind of herbs, and at the same
    </p>
    <p>
     time said he would not administer any medicine himself, but would tell
    </p>
    <p>
     their own native physicians and nurses all he knew, so that they could
    </p>
    <p>
     use his knowledge. The herb-garden was at once begun in the valley; it
    </p>
    <p>
     could not contain much till next year, and meantime if any diseased
    </p>
    <p>
     persons came Felix saw them, expressed his opinion to the old shepherd
    </p>
    <p>
     who was the doctor of the tribe, and the latter carried out his
    </p>
    <p>
     instructions. Felix did succeed in relieving some small ailments, and
    </p>
    <p>
     thereby added to his reputation.

     CHAPTER XXVIII
    </head>
    <p>
     FOR AURORA
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix now began to find out for himself the ancient truth, that
    </p>
    <p>
     difficulties always confront man. Success only changes them, and
    </p>
    <p>
     increases their number. Difficulties faced him in every direction; at
    </p>
    <p>
     home it had seemed impossible for him to do anything. Now that success
    </p>
    <p>
     seemed to smile on him and he had become a power, instead of everything
    </p>
    <p>
     being smooth and easy, new difficulties sprang up for solution at every
    </p>
    <p>
     point. He wished to continue his journey, but he feared that he would
    </p>
    <p>
     not be permitted to depart. He would have to start away in the night, in
    </p>
    <p>
     which case he could hardly return to them again, and yet he wished to
    </p>
    <p>
     return to these, the first friends he had had, and amongst whom he hoped
    </p>
    <p>
     to found a city.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another week slipped away, and Felix was meditating his escape, when one
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon a deputation of ten spearmen arrived from a distant tribe, who
    </p>
    <p>
     had nominated him their king, and sent their principal men to convey the
    </p>
    <p>
     intelligence. Fame is always greatest at a distance, and this tribe in
    </p>
    <p>
     the mountains of the east had actually chosen him as king, and declared
    </p>
    <p>
     that they would obey him whether he took up his residence with them or
    </p>
    <p>
     not. Felix was naturally greatly pleased; how delighted Aurora would be!
    </p>
    <p>
     but he was in perplexity what to do, for he could not tell whether the
    </p>
    <p>
     Wolfstead people would be favourably inclined or would resent his
    </p>
    <p>
     selection.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had not long to consider. There was an assembly of the tribe, and
    </p>
    <p>
     they, too, chose him by common consent as their king. Secretly they were
    </p>
    <p>
     annoyed that another tribe had been more forward than themselves, and
    </p>
    <p>
     were anxious that Felix should not leave them. Felix declined the
    </p>
    <p>
     honour; in spite of his refusal, he was treated as if he were the most
    </p>
    <p>
     despotic monarch. Four days afterwards two other tribes joined the
    </p>
    <p>
     movement, and sent their acceptance of him as their monarch. Others
    </p>
    <p>
     followed, and so quickly now that a day never passed without another
    </p>
    <p>
     tribe sending a deputation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Felix thought deeply on the matter. He was, of course, flattered, and
    </p>
    <p>
     ready to accept the dignity, but he was alive to considerations of
    </p>
    <p>
     policy. He resolved that he would not use the title, nor exercise the
    </p>
    <p>
     functions of a king as usually understood. He explained his plan to the
    </p>
    <p>
     chiefs; it was that he should be called simply "Leader", the Leader of
    </p>
    <p>
     the War; that he should only assume royal authority in time of war; that
    </p>
    <p>
     the present chiefs should retain their authority, and each govern as
    </p>
    <p>
     before, in accordance with ancient custom. He proposed to be king only
    </p>
    <p>
     during war-time. He would, if they liked, write out their laws for them
    </p>
    <p>
     in a book, and so give their customs cohesion and shape. To this plan
    </p>
    <p>
     the tribes readily agreed; it retained all the former customs, it left
    </p>
    <p>
     the chiefs their simple patriarchal authority, and it gave all of them
    </p>
    <p>
     the advantage of combination in war. As the Leader, Felix was henceforth
    </p>
    <p>
     known.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the course of a fortnight, upwards of six thousand men had joined the
    </p>
    <p>
     Confederacy, and Felix wrote down the names of twenty tribes on a sheet
    </p>
    <p>
     of parchment which he took from his chest. A hut had long since been
    </p>
    <p>
     built for him; but he received all the deputations, and held the
    </p>
    <p>
     assemblies which were necessary, in the circular fort. He was so pressed
    </p>
    <p>
     to visit the tribes that he could not refuse to go to the nearest, and
    </p>
    <p>
     thus his journey was again postponed. During this progress from tribal
    </p>
    <p>
     camp to tribal camp, Felix gained the adhesion of twelve more, making a
    </p>
    <p>
     total of thirty-two names of camps, representing about eight thousand
    </p>
    <p>
     spearmen. With pride Felix reflected that he commanded a far larger army
    </p>
    <p>
     than the Prince of Ponze. But he was not happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Months had now elapsed since he had parted from Aurora. There were no
    </p>
    <p>
     means of communicating with her. A letter could be conveyed only by a
    </p>
    <p>
     special messenger; he could not get a messenger, and even if one had
    </p>
    <p>
     been forthcoming, he could not instruct him how to reach Thyma Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
     He did not know himself; the country was entirely unexplored. Except
    </p>
    <p>
     that the direction was west, he had no knowledge whatever. He had often
    </p>
    <p>
     inquired of the shepherds, but they were perfectly ignorant. Anker's
    </p>
    <p>
     Gate was the most westerly of all their settlements, which chiefly
    </p>
    <p>
     extended eastwards. Beyond Anker's Gate was the trackless forest, of
    </p>
    <p>
     which none but the Bushmen knew anything. They did not understand what
    </p>
    <p>
     he meant by a map; all they could tell him was that the range of
    </p>
    <p>
     mountainous hills continued westerly and southerly for an unascertained
    </p>
    <p>
     distance, and that the country was uninhabited except by wandering gipsy
    </p>
    <p>
     tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
     South was the sea, the salt water; but they never went down to it, or
    </p>
    <p>
     near it, because there was no sustenance for their flocks and herds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Till now, Felix did not know that he was near the sea; he resolved at
    </p>
    <p>
     once to visit it. As nearly as he could discover, the great fresh water
    </p>
    <p>
     Lake did not reach any farther south; Wolfstead was not far from its
    </p>
    <p>
     southern margin. He concluded, therefore, that the shore of the Lake
    </p>
    <p>
     must run continually westward, and that if he followed it he should
    </p>
    <p>
     ultimately reach the very creek from which he had started in his canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
     How far it was he could not reckon.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were none of the shepherds who could be sent with a letter; they
    </p>
    <p>
     were not hunters, and were unused to woodcraft; there was not one
    </p>
    <p>
     capable of the journey. Unless he went himself he could not communicate
    </p>
    <p>
     with Aurora. Two routes were open to him; one straight through the
    </p>
    <p>
     forest on foot, the other by water, which latter entailed the
    </p>
    <p>
     construction of another canoe. Journey by water, too, he had found was
    </p>
    <p>
     subject to unforeseen risks. Till he could train some of the younger men
    </p>
    <p>
     to row a galley, he decided not to attempt the voyage. There was but the
    </p>
    <p>
     forest route left, and that he resolved to attempt; but when? And how,
    </p>
    <p>
     without offending his friends?
    </p>
    <p>
     Meantime, while he revolved the subject in his mind, he visited the
    </p>
    <p>
     river and the shore of the great Lake, this time accompanied by ten
    </p>
    <p>
     spears. The second visit only increased his admiration of the place and
    </p>
    <p>
     his desire to take possession of it. He ascended a tall larch, from
    </p>
    <p>
     whose boughs he had a view out over the Lake; the shore seemed to go
    </p>
    <p>
     almost directly west. There were no islands, and no land in sight; the
    </p>
    <p>
     water was open and clear. Next day he started for the sea; he wished to
    </p>
    <p>
     see it for its own sake, and, secondly, because if he could trace the
    </p>
    <p>
     trend of the shore, he would perhaps be able to put together a mental
    </p>
    <p>
     map of the country, and so assure himself of the right route to pursue
    </p>
    <p>
     when he started for Thyma Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
     His guides took him directly south, and in three marches (three days)
    </p>
    <p>
     brought him to the strand. This journey was not in a straight line; they
    </p>
    <p>
     considered it was about five-and-thirty or forty miles to the sea, but
    </p>
    <p>
     the country was covered with almost impenetrable forests, which
    </p>
    <p>
     compelled a circuitous path. They had also to avoid a great ridge of
    </p>
    <p>
     hills, and to slip through a pass or river valley, because these hills
    </p>
    <p>
     were frequently traversed by the gipsies who were said, indeed, to
    </p>
    <p>
     travel along them for hundreds of miles. Through the river valley,
    </p>
    <p>
     therefore, which wound between the hills, they approached the sea, so
    </p>
    <p>
     much on a level with it that Felix did not catch a distant glimpse.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the afternoon of the third day they heard a low murmur, and soon
    </p>
    <p>
     afterwards came out from the forest itself upon a wide bed of shingle,
    </p>
    <p>
     thinly bordered with scattered bushes on the inland side. Climbing over
    </p>
    <p>
     this, Felix saw the green line of the sea rise and extend itself on
    </p>
    <p>
     either hand; in the glory of the scene he forgot his anxieties and his
    </p>
    <p>
     hopes, they fell from him together, leaving the mind alone with itself
    </p>
    <p>
     and love. For the memory of Aurora rendered the beauty before him still
    </p>
    <p>
     more beautiful; love, like the sunshine, threw a glamour over the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     His old and highest thoughts returned to him in all their strength. He
    </p>
    <p>
     must follow them, he could not help himself. Standing where the foam
    </p>
    <p>
     came nearly to his feet, the resolution to pursue his aspirations took
    </p>
    <p>
     possession of him as strong as the sea. When he turned from it, he said
    </p>
    <p>
     to himself, "This is the first step homewards to her; this is the first
    </p>
    <p>
     step of my renewed labour." To fulfil his love and his ambition was one
    </p>
    <p>
     and the same thing. He must see her, and then again endeavour with all
    </p>
    <p>
     his abilities to make himself a position which she could share.
    </p>
    <p>
     Towards the evening, leaving his escort, he partly ascended the nearest
    </p>
    <p>
     slope of the hills to ascertain more perfectly than was possible at a
    </p>
    <p>
     lower level the direction in which the shore trended. It was nearly east
    </p>
    <p>
     and west, and as the shore of the inland lake ran west, it appeared that
    </p>
    <p>
     between them there was a broad belt of forest. Through this he must
    </p>
    <p>
     pass, and he thought if he continued due west he should cross an
    </p>
    <p>
     imaginary line drawn south from his own home through Thyma Castle; then
    </p>
    <p>
     by turning to the north he should presently reach that settlement. But
    </p>
    <p>
     when he should cross this line, how many days' travelling it would need
    </p>
    <p>
     to reach it, was a matter of conjecture, and he must be guided by
    </p>
    <p>
     circumstances, the appearance of the country, and his hunter's instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the way back to Wolfstead Felix was occupied in considering how he
    </p>
    <p>
     could leave his friends, and yet be able to return to them and resume
    </p>
    <p>
     his position. His general idea was to build a fortified house or castle
    </p>
    <p>
     at the spot which had so pleased him, and to bring Aurora to it. He
    </p>
    <p>
     could then devote himself to increasing and consolidating his rule over
    </p>
    <p>
     these people, and perhaps in time organize a kingdom. But without Aurora
    </p>
    <p>
     the time it would require would be unendurable; by some means he must
    </p>
    <p>
     bring her. The whole day long as he walked he thought and thought,
    </p>
    <p>
     trying to discover some means by which he could accomplish these things;
    </p>
    <p>
     yet the more he considered the more difficult they appeared to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     There seemed no plan that promised success; all he could do would be to
    </p>
    <p>
     risk the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     But two days after returning from the sea it chanced towards the
    </p>
    <p>
     afternoon he fell asleep, and on awakening found his mind full of ideas
    </p>
    <p>
     which he felt sure would succeed if anything would. The question had
    </p>
    <p>
     solved itself during sleep; the mind, like a wearied limb, strained by
    </p>
    <p>
     too much effort, had recovered its elasticity and freshness, and he saw
    </p>
    <p>
     clearly what he ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     He convened an assembly of the chief men of the nearest tribes, and
    </p>
    <p>
     addressed them in the circular fort. He asked them if they could place
    </p>
    <p>
     sufficient confidence in him to assist him in carrying out certain
    </p>
    <p>
     plans, although he should not be able to altogether disclose the object
    </p>
    <p>
     he had in view.
    </p>
    <p>
     They replied as one man that they had perfect confidence in him, and
    </p>
    <p>
     would implicitly obey.
    </p>
    <p>
     He then said that the first thing he wished was the clearing of the land
    </p>
    <p>
     by the river in order that he might erect a fortified dwelling suitable
    </p>
    <p>
     to his position as their Leader in war. Next he desired their permission
    </p>
    <p>
     to leave them for two months, at the end of which he would return. He
    </p>
    <p>
     could not at that time explain the reasons, but until his journey had
    </p>
    <p>
     been made he could not finally settle among them.
    </p>
    <p>
     To this announcement they listened in profound silence. It was evident
    </p>
    <p>
     that they disliked him leaving them, yet did not wish to seem
    </p>
    <p>
     distrustful by expressing the feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirdly, he continued, he wanted them to clear a path through the
    </p>
    <p>
     forest, commencing at Anker's Gate and proceeding exactly west. The
    </p>
    <p>
     track to be thirty yards wide in order that the undergrowth might not
    </p>
    <p>
     encroach upon it, and to be carried on straight to the westward until
    </p>
    <p>
     his return. The distance to which this path was cleared he should take
    </p>
    <p>
     as the measure of their loyalty to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     They immediately promised to fulfil this desire, but added that there
    </p>
    <p>
     was no necessity to wait till he left them, it should be commenced the
    </p>
    <p>
     very next morning. To his reiterated request for leave of absence they
    </p>
    <p>
     preserved an ominous silence, and as he had no more to say, the assembly
    </p>
    <p>
     then broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was afternoon, and Felix, as he watched the departing chiefs,
    </p>
    <p>
     reflected that these men would certainly set a watch upon him to prevent
    </p>
    <p>
     his escape. Without another moment's delay he entered his hut, and took
    </p>
    <p>
     from their hiding-place the diamond bracelet, the turquoise ring, and
    </p>
    <p>
     other presents for Aurora. He also secured some provisions, and put two
    </p>
    <p>
     spare bowstrings in his pocket. His bow of course he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Telling the people about that he was going to the next settlement,
    </p>
    <p>
     Bedeston, and was anxious to overtake the chief from that place who had
    </p>
    <p>
     attended the assembly, he started. So soon as he knew he could not be
    </p>
    <p>
     seen from the settlement he quitted the trail, and made a wide circuit
    </p>
    <p>
     till he faced westwards. Anker's Gate was a small outlying post, the
    </p>
    <p>
     most westerly from Wolfstead; he went near it to get a true direction,
    </p>
    <p>
     but not sufficiently near to be observed. This was on the fourth of
    </p>
    <p>
     September. The sun was declining as he finally left the country of his
    </p>
    <p>
     friends, and entered the immense forest which lay between him and
    </p>
    <p>
     Aurora. Not only was there no track, but no one had ever traversed it,
    </p>
    <p>
     unless, indeed, it were Bushmen, who to all intents might be confused
    </p>
    <p>
     with the wild animals which it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet his heart rose as he walked rapidly among the oaks; already he saw
    </p>
    <p>
     her, he felt the welcoming touch of her hand; the danger of Bushman or
    </p>
    <p>
     gipsy was nothing. The forest at the commencement consisted chiefly of
    </p>
    <p>
     oaks, trees which do not grow close together, and so permitted of quick
    </p>
    <p>
     walking. Felix pushed on, absorbed in thought. The sun sank; still
    </p>
    <p>
     onward; and as the dusk fell he was still moving rapidly westwards.
    </p>
    <p>
